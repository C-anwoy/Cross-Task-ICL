Bradley got on the road. Zach gave Bradley a few driving tips: Don't drive next to big trucks, because you never know when they might crush  you. Don't drive behind trucks filled with things, because you never know when something in the truck will fly out and hit your car.

Context: The drug store was closing for the night. Young Alfred Higgins, the shop-assistant, was ready to go home. Mr. Carr, the boss, stared at him and said: ""Stop! Alfred. Maybe you'd be good enough to take the things out of your pockets and leave them here before you go."" Alfred's face got red. After a little hesitation , he took out what he had stolen. Mr. Carr said, ""Maybe I should call you mother and let her know I'm going to have to put you in prison.""
Alfred thought his mother would come rushing in, eyes burning with anger. But, to his surprise, she arrived wearing a smile. ""Hello, I'm Alfred's mother. Is he in trouble?"" she said. Mr. Carr was surprised, too. He had expected Alfred's mother to come in nervously, shaking with fear, asking with wet eyes for a mercy   for her son. Yet, she was most calm, quiet, and pleasant, which made Mr. Carr feel guilty  . Soon Mr. Carr was shaking his head in agreement with what she was saying. ""Of course"", he said, ""I don't want to be cruel. You are right. Sometimes, a little good advice is the best thing for a boy at certain times in his life and it often takes the youth a long time to grow up."" And he warmly shook Mrs. Higgins's hand. 
Back home, without even looking at Alfred, she said, ""You are a burden. Your trouble came one after another, always! Why do you stand there so stupidly? Go to bed."" In his bedroom, Alfred heard his mother in the kitchen. Getting to the kitchen, he saw his mother drinking a cup of tea. His mother's face was a frightened, broken one, totally different from the earlier cool, bright face. She lifted the tea cup, her hands shaking, the lips moving nervously. 
He watched his mother quietly, without making a sound. The picture of his mother nearly made him cry. Realizing all the troubles he brought his mother in her shaking hands and the deep lines of worry in her grey face, he felt he shouldn't have done such a shameful theft to hurt his mother so deeply. He determined to grow up like a true man and protect his mother rather than hurt her again. 
 Question:The reason why Mr. Carr felt guilty was that   _  . 
A. Alfred's mother appeared polite and gentle 
B. he should have called a policeman at first 
C. he found Alfred was in fact not wrong 
D. he thought he was partly responsible for it

Context: Writer and power chair adventurer Mary Laver has not walked for twenty years. Yet the cheerful and positive 60 year old is not only refusing to let her disability get her down ---- she is also planning to cross the length of Britain in a power wheelchair.
Getting ready for the trip is not easy. She has already run into many problems - not least officials and organizations who view her as a health and safety risk. One police officer wrote to Mary requesting:
1. The proposed route through our area with road numbers.
2. The dates and times each day that this will be taking place.
3. The location details of the proposed overnight stops.
4. The names and mobile phone contact details of the Support Crew.
Another police officer asked her to travel off road! As Mary told me, this was unacceptable - as a power wheelchair user with limited movement _ "".
There are other problems in her way though - she is, after all, in her 60's and has severe rheumatoid arthritis . However, unlike many other people with arthritis, she is no longer in pain.
""When you are in a power chair and it is going at eight miles an hour, believe me it feels fast ... to me it is the Formula One  chair of electric wheelchairs.""
At the end of the interview, I asked Mary if she had a message for any other power chair users who wanted to do a challenge, and her reply was simple:""Just do it!"" 
 Question:What is Mary Laver planning to do? 
A. Travel to write a power wheelchair adventure. 
B. Travel across Britain in a power wheelchair. 
C. Prove she can do what a man can in driving.

Context: On Nov.18,1995,Itzhak Perlman,the violinist,came on stage to give a concert at Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center in New York City.
If you have ever been to a Perlman concert, _ him.He was stricken with polio as a child,and so he has braces on both legs and walks with the aid of two crutches .
He walks painfully, yet majestically, until he reaches his chair.Then he sits down,slowly, puts his crutches on the floor, undoes the clasps on his legs,tucks one foot back and extends the other foot forward.Then he bends down and picks up the violin, puts it under his chin,nods to the conductor and proceeds to play.
But this time,something went wrong.Just as he fmished the first few bars ,one of the strings on his violin broke.You could hear it snap ---it went off like gunfire across the room.There was no mistaking what that meant.There was no mistaking what he had to do.
We figured that he would have to get up,put on the clasps again,pick up the crutches and limp his way off stage-to either find another violin or else find another string for this one.But he didn't.Instead.he waited a moment,closed his eyes and then signaled the conductor to begin again.
The orchestra began,and he played from where he had left off.And he played with such passion and such power and such purity as they had never heard before.
When he finished, there was an awesome silence in the room.And then people rose and cheered.He smiled,wiped the sweat from this brow, raised his bow to quit us,and then he said in a quiet tone.""You know, sometimes it is the artist's task to find out how much music you can still make with what you have left.'' 
 Question:Itzhak Perlman can be best described as a man who is  _  . 
A. clever 
B. strong willed 
C. humourous 
D. quite skilled

Context: Providing a highquality education for all children is important to America's economic future.President Obama has decided to provide every child with access to a complete and competitive education,from cradle  through career.
The years before a child reaches kindergarten are among the most _ in his or her life to influence learning.The President will urge states to introduce high standards across all publicly funded early learning settings,develop new programs to improve opportunities and outcomes,engage parents in their child's early learning and development,and improve the early education workforce.
President Obama will reform America's public schools to deliver a 21st century education that will prepare all children for success in the new global workplace.He will push to end the use of ineffective,""offtheshelf"" tests,and support new,stateoftheart assessment and responsibility systems that provide timely and useful information about the learning and progress of students.
Teachers are the single most important resource to children's learning.President Obama will invest in a national effort to reward outstanding teachers,while enlisting the best and brightest in the field of teaching.And he will challenge State and school districts to remove ineffective teachers from the classroom.
The President believes that investment in education must be accompanied by reform and innovation  .He supports the expansion of highquality charter schools  .He has challenged States to lift limits that stop growth among successful charter schools and has encouraged strict responsibility for all charter schools.
President Obama has decided to ensure that America will regain its lost ground and have the highest proportion of students graduating from college in the world by 2020.The President believes that regardless of educational path after high school,all Americans should enroll in at least one year of higher education or job training to better prepare our workforce for the 21st century economy.
To reach these goals,the President has decided to increase higher education access and success by restructuring and greatly expanding college financial aid,while making federal programs simpler,more reliable,and more efficient for students. 
 Question:Which of the following things is NOT part of President Obama's decision? 
A. Remove ineffective teachers from the classroom. 
B. Reform America's public schools. 
C. Enlist some teachers from other countries.

Context: Pushy parents and teachers who ""hothouse"" the under-5s risk causing damage to the children's long term development, a leading education expert said.
Lilian Katz, Professor of Education at the University of Illinois, said that four-year-olds engaged in reading and writing went on to perform worse academically than those engaged in imaginative learning. They scored higher in tests at the age of 5, but children whose first year at school was stimulating _ them four years later.
The findings suggest that the government's structured approach to early years' learning could be storing up problems for children. They also raise serious questions about the plan for all children to be able to read by the age of 6.
In many countries formal teaching does not start until children are 6 or 7 and have improved their social and manual skills. Children start learning to read and write at 6 in the United States, France and Germany, and at 7 in Finland and Sweden.
Professor Katz said that in many schools the courses were ""boring children to tears"". Much academic teaching required children to learn by memorizing pieces of information out of context, she said. Teaching in reception class should instead allow children to develop their intellect by exploring their environments and asking questions.
""Research suggests the benefits of formal academic instruction for four- and five-year-olds seem to be promising when they are tested early, but considerably less so in the long term. When these children are followed over a period of three or more years, those who had early experience in more intellectually engaging curricula were more likely to do well in school than their peers, who had received early academic instruction."" She advocates teaching children through first-hand experience and play, in mixed-aged classes. This can include puppet shows, drawing or running a pretend shop in the classroom. 
 Question:According to Lilian Katz, the government's structured approach to early-years learning   _  . 
A. is necessary for improving children's reading and writing ability 
B. needs to be improved to develop children's academic ability 
C. will cause problems to children in their future learning 
D. has more advantages than disadvantages

Context: Every day from the time we wake up until the time we go to bed, we are bombarded with information from all sides, from TV, radio, newspapers and books; from family, friends, and colleagues. As a new cable television subscriber, I am  ly amazed at the quantity and varying levels of information quality on cable television. Including the networks, there are eight TV ""news"" organizations vying to provide us with all the information we can possibly absorb. Newspaper, magazines, books, radio, the Internet, email, snail mail, and the telephone all compete for our attention and our minds. At the office conversations around the water cooler and coffee maker serve to spread even more items of information.
  There is valuable information out there about the world we live in, on topics as varied as health, safety, traffic, nutrition, business, finance, philosophy, nature, science, weather, history and the human condition. There is also a large amount of misleading and outright false information, not just on controversial subjects such as politics and religion but on any topic one can think of, including all of the topics mentioned above.
  With all this information coming at us from all directions, how does one sift through it all to sort out the facts from the fiction, the truth from the lies, the more important from the less important? Should we turn off the TV, cancel our newspaper subscriptions, disconnect our phones and modems to become information ""hermits""? Probably not.
  A better method of sifting through the information wave without being overwhelmed and confused is to become a skeptical inquirer-or skeptic-with regard to the surrounding world. By ""skeptic""-I do not mean a cynic-a person who rejects new ideas simply because they are new. A skeptic is one who questions the validity of a particular claim by calling for evidence to prove or disprove it. Skepticism is a method, not a position. It is a provisional approach to all factual claims. In terms of processing information, a skeptic needs to be able to grasp reality and acquire knowledge about the environment that agrees with reason, logic, and evidence. In other words, as skeptics, when we hear a claim that may or may not be fantastic, we should say, ""That's nice, prove it."" 
 Question:When faced with an incredible or fantastic claim, what shall we do according to the author? 
A. Ask questions and look for proof. 
B. Ignore the information and its source. 
C. Change the subject immediately. 
D. Try to consult an expert who knows the truth. 
 Answer: A
Context: The newspaper must provide for the reader the facts, pure, unprejudiced , objectively selected facts. But in these days the complex news it must provide more; it must supply explanation, the meaning of the facts. This is the most important assignment facing American journalism--to make clear to the reader the problems of the day, to make international news understandable as community news, to recognize that there is no longer any such thing(with the possible exception of society news)as ""local"" news, because any event in the international area has local reaction in the financial market, political circles, indeed, of our very way of life. There is in journalism a widespread view that when you consider giving an explanation, you are entering dangerous water, the swirling tides of opinion. This is nonsense.
The opponents of explanation insist that the writer and the editor shall confine himself to the ""facts"". This insistence raises two questions; What are the facts? And are the bare facts enough? As for the first question, consider how a so-called ""factual"" story comes about. The reporter collects, say, fifty facts; out of these fifty, his space being necessarily restricted, he selects the ten that he considers most important. This is Judgment Number One. Then he or his editor decides which of these ten facts shall constitute the beginning of the article. (this is an important decision because many readers do not proceed beyond the first paragraph) This is Judgment Number Two. Then. The night editor decides whether the article shall be presented on page one, where it has a large influence, or on page twenty-four, where it has little. Judgment Number Three.
Thus in the show of a so-called ""factual"" of ""objective"" story, at least three judgments are involved. And they are judgments mot at all unlike those involved in explanation, in which reporter and editor, calling upon their research resources , their general background, and their ""news neutralism"" , arrive at a conclusion as to the importance of the news.
The two areas of judgment, presentation of the news and its explanation, are both objective rather than subjective processes--as objective, that is, as any human being can be. (Note in passing; even though complete objectivity can never be achieved, nevertheless the ideal must always be the light in the murky news channels) If an editor is intern on giving a prejudiced view of the news, he can do it in other ways and more effectively than by explanation. He can do it by the selection of those facts that support his particular viewpoint. Or he can do it by the play he gives a story promoting it to page one or putting it on page thirty. 
 Question:The best title for this passage is     . 
A. Function of the Night Editor 
B. Explaining the News. 
C. Subjective versus Objective Processes 
D. Choosing Facts

Context: After moving to a small town, I took several pairs of shoes to the shoemaker to be fixed. Within a week I picked them up and put them away in my closet.
Four months later my husband and I were invited out to dinner. I unboxed a pair of high heels . I hadn't worn them since they were repaired. I put one shoe on my right foot, and then I put the other on my left. I took both shoes off for a closer look. They were exactly the same style, color1 and size, but each was for the right foot.
I was puzzled, since I had worn the shoes on several occasions and knew I hadn't worn two right shoes. Then I thought of the shoemaker. Although I was sure he wouldn't remember me after such a long time, I telephoned him and explained to him the trouble I had.
""Thank goodness you finally called!"" he was nearly shouting, ""An angry woman with two left shoes has been bothering for months!""

Context: The girl was hanging by her hands from the railings of a balcony . The balcony was on the twelfth floor of the high-rise block next to his. His flat was on the ninth floor and he had to look up to see her. It was half-past six in the morning. He had been awakened by the sound of an aircraft flying dangerously low overhead, and had got out of bed to look. His sleepy eyes, moved from the blue sky which was empty of cloud, empty of anything but the bright disappearing arrow of the aircraft, and then rested on the hanging figure.
He really thought he must be dreaming, for this sunrise time was the hour for dreams. Then, when he knew he wasn't, he decided it must be a scene in a film. There were cameramen down there, a whole film unit, and all the correct safety precautions had been taken. Probably the girl wasn't even a real girl, but a dummy . He opened the window and looked down. The car park, paved courts, grass spaces between the blocks, all were deserted. On the balcony rail one of the dummy's hands moved, desperately. He had to believe then what was obviously happening. The girl was trying to kill herself. She had lost her courage and now was trying to stay alive. All these thoughts and conclusions of his occupied about thirty seconds. Then he acted. He picked up the phone and dialed the emergency number for the police.
The arrival of the police cars and the rescue of the girl became the focus of talk for the people of the two blocks. Someone found out that it was he who had called the police and he became an unwilling hero. He was a modest, quiet young man, and was in relief when the talk began to die away. Again he was able to enter and leave his flat without being pointed at as a kind of St George and sometimes even congratulated.
About a fortnight after that morning, he was getting ready to go to the theatre, just putting on his overcoat, when the doorbell rang. He didn't recognize the girl who stood outside. He had never seen her face. She said, ""I'm Lydia Simpson. You saved my life. I've come to thank you.""

Context: One evening after dinner, Mr. and Mrs. Tisich called a family meeting. ""We've had to make a difficult decision,"" Mr. Tisich announced. ""You see, your mother has been offered a post as co-director of a television station in Chicago. Unfortunately, the station is not here. After thinking long and hard about it, we've concluded that the right decision is to move to Chicago."" Marc looked shocked, while his sister Rachel breathlessly started asking when they'd be moving. ""It's surprising, but exciting!"" she said. Marc simply said, ""We can't go--I can't leave all my friends. I'd rather stay here and live with Tommy Lyons!""
The Tisichs hoped that by the time they moved in August, Marc would grow more used to the idea of leaving. However, he showed no signs of accepting the news, refusing to pack his belongings. When the morning of the move arrived, Marc was nowhere to be found. His parents called Tommy Lyon's house, but Mrs. Lyons said she hadn't seen Marc. Mrs. Tisich became increasingly concerned, while her husband felt angry with their son for behaving so irresponsibly.
What they didn't know was that Marc had started walking over to Tommy's house, with a faint idea of hiding in Lyons's attic  for a few days. But something happened on the way as Marc walked past all the familiar landscape of the neighborhood: the fence that he and his mother painted, the tree that he and his sister used to climb, the park where he and his father often took evening walks together. How much would these mean without his family, who make them special in the first place? Marc didn't take the time to answer that question but instead hurried back to his house, wondering if there were any moving cartons the right size to hold his record collection. 
 Question:The reason for Marc's going home was that  _  . 
A. he did not want to be left behind 
B. he realized his family was important to him 
C. he hoped to reach an agreement with his parents 
D. he wished to be a more responsible person

Context: I never thought I would have a life-changing experience at Wal-Mart.
Although my thoughts were only on speed, the checkout line I was standing in wasn't moving as quickly as I wanted, and I glanced toward the cashier.
There stood a man in his seventies, wearing glasses and a nice smile. I thought, well, he's an old guy!
For the next few minutes I watched him. He greeted every customer before scanning the items. Sure, his words were the usual, ""How's it going?"" But he did something different--he actually listened to people. Then he would respond to what they had said and engage them in brief conversation.
I thought it was odd. I has grown accustomed to people asking me how I was doing simply out of robotic conversational habit. After a while, you don't give any thought to the question and just mumble something back. I could say, ""I just found out I have six months to live,"" and someone would reply, ""Have a great day!""
But that wasn't the end.
He gave them the change, walked around the counter, and extended his right hand in an act of friendship. He looked the customers in the eyes. ""I sure want to thank you for shopping here today,"" he told them. ""You have a great day. Bye-bye.""
The looks on the faces of the customers were priceless. There were smiles and some sheepish grins. All had been touched by his simple gesture--and in a place they never expected. They would gather their things and walk out, smiling.
Of course, he did the same to me and I got to know his name--Marty.
Who was that guy? It was as if Sam Walton had come back from the dead and invaded this old guy's body.
I had never walked away from that shop feeling like that. 
 Question:According to the writer, when common people ask you ""How's it going?"" 
A. they are just practicing their conversation ability 
B. they are inquiring about your private information 
C. they don't expect to hear any negative answers 
D. they don't really care what you may answer

Context: It was something she had dreamed of since she was five. Finally, after years of training and intensive workouts, Deborah Duffey was going to compete in her first high school basketball game. The goals of becoming an outstanding player and playing college ball were never far from Deborah's mind.
The game was against Mills High School. With 1 minute and 42 seconds left in the game, Deborah's team led by one point. A player of Mills had possession of the ball,and Deborah ran to guard against her. As Deborah was running to block the player, her knee went out and she fell down on the court in burning pain. Just like that, Deborah's season was over.
After suffering the bad injury, Deborah found that, for the first time in her life, she was in a situation beyond her control. Game after game, she could do nothing but sit on the sidelines watching others play the game that she loved so much.
Injuries limited Deborah's time on the court as she hurt her knees three more times in the next five years. She had to spend countless hours in a physical clinic to receive treatment. Her frequent visits there gave her a passion and respect for the profession.  And Deborah began to see a new light in her life.
Currently as a senior in college, Deborah focuses on getting a degree in physical treatment. After she graduates, Deborah plans to use her knowledge to educate people how to best take care of their bodies and cope with the feelings of hopelessness that she remembers so well.

Context: A study has found, spending hours playing violent video games prevents teenagers from their moral growth. It is thought that regular touch to violence and lack of contact with the outside world makes it harder for them to tell right from wrong.They also struggle to trust other people,and see the world from their viewpoints.
Researchers from Brock University in Ontario found that those who spend more than three hours each day in front of the screen are particularly unlikely to have developed the ability to empathize .
The Canadian researchers surveyed 109 boys and girls,aged 13 and 14,about whether they played video games,which games they liked,and how long they spent playing them.Their findings found that 88 percent of teens said they played games,and more than half admitted to playing games every day.Violent games were among the most popular.
The teenagers also filled in a questionnaire designed to measure their moral development.For example,they were asked how important it is to save the life of a friend.
Previous studies have suggested that a person's moral judgment goes through four phases as they grow from children and enter adulthood.By the age of 13 or 14,scientists claim young people should be entering the third stage,and be able to empathize with others and take their viewpoints into account.The research found that this stage appeared to be delayed in teenagers who regularly played violent video games.
It is also thought that teenagers who play games regularly did not spend enough time in the real world to learn to take others' thoughts into consideration.Researcher Mirjana Bajovic said:""The present results indicate that some teenagers, who spent three or more hours a day playing violent video games,are deprived of such opportunities."" he added:""Touch to violence in video games may influence the development of moral reasoning because violence is not only presented as acceptable but is also justified and rewarded.""
They concluded that rather than trying to enforce an 'unrealistic' ban on the games,parents and teachers should encourage teenagers to do charity work and take up after-school activities. 
 Question:What does Mirjana Bajovic want to tell us according to his words? 
A. Playing games regularly will improve teens' intelligence. 
B. Vio1ent games cost teens social experiences in real life. 
C. Playing games makes teens help others. 
D. Playing games inspires teens to develop fast.

""I'd like to help Mr Zimmerman,"" thought Jane ,""but if I do , I won't have time to do my homework."" She hated to think what Mr Robert would say if she didn't finish  papers.
""It's his own fault for running out of gas,"" Jane talked to herself. ""The station is only a half mile down the street . Surely Mr Zimmerman can walk that far, even on a cold morning like this...can't he?"" As she walked down the street , Jane still wondered what to do.

Context: Robert Fredy was general manager of a large hotel in Ashbury park. New Jersey. One cold day two years ago when he stopped his car at a traffic light, Stephen Pear man, an out-of-work taxi and truck driver, walked up to Fredy's car hoping to earn some change by washing his windshield.Like many motorists who try to keep the beggars off, Fredy turned on the wipers to show he wasn't interested.
Pearman put his head close to the window.""Come on, mister.Give me a chance.I need a job,"" he said.Something in Stephen Pearman's voice moved Robert Fredy.In the seconds before traffic started moving again, Fredy handed a business card and told him to call if he was serious.
""My friends told me he was just pulling my leg, ""said Pearman.""But I said, "" No, he's a
businessman.I need to give it a shot.""
Two days later,29-year-old Pearman appeared in the manager's office of the big hotel.Fredy gave him a job and housing and lent him pocket money while training him.
Today, Pearman works full time setting up the hotel's dining halls for business meetings.In the past two years, he has found a flat, married and repaid Fredy's loans.
""Mr.Fredy gave me a second chance, ""says Pearman, "" And I took advantage of it.I could have just come here a while, eaten up and left.But there is no future in washing windshields.""
Ordinarily, Fredy keeps away from the street people.""But Pearman seemed so honest and open, asking for a chance rather than just money,"" Fredy says, ""I don't hand my business card to just anybody.But I'm glad I did in this case.""

Context: Humor is a most effective, yet frequently neglected, means of handling the difficult situations in our lives. It can be used for patching up differences, apologizing, saying ""no,"" criticizing, getting the other fellow to do what you want without his losing face. For some jobs, it's the only tool that can succeed. It is a way to discuss subjects so sensitive that serious dialogue may start a quarrel. For example, many believe that comedians on television are doing more today for racial and religious tolerance than people in any other forum.
Humor is often the best way to keep a small misunderstanding from escalating into a big deal. Recently a neighbor of mine had a squabble with his wife as she drove him to the airport. Airborne, he felt miserable, and he knew she did, too. Two hours after she returned home, she received a long-distance phone call. ""Person-to-person for Mrs. I. A. Pologize,"" intoned the operator. ""That's spelled 'P' as in..."" In a twinkling, the whole day changed from grim to lovely at both ends of the wire.
An English hostess with a quick wit was giving a formal dinner for eight distinguished guests whom she hoped to enlist in a major charity drive. Austerity was a fashion in England at the time, and she had asked her children to serve the meal. She knew that anything could happen--and it did, just as her son, with the studied concentration of a tightrope walker, brought in a large roast turkey. He successfully elbowed the swinging dining-room door, but the backswing threw the bird onto the dining-room floor.
The boy stood rooted: guests stared at their plates. Moving only her head the hostess smiled at her son,"" No harm, Daniel,"" she said. ""Just pick him up and take him back to the kitchen""... she enunciated clearly so he would think about what she was saying... ""and bring in the other one.""
A wink and a one-liner instantly changed the dinner from a red-faced embarrassment to a conspiracy of fun. 
 Question:Which of the following is NOT stated in the passage? 
A. Comedians on TV are believed to have done a lot in making people more tolerant of racial and religious differences. 
B. To make up differences, humor is a most acceptable as well as a most effective means. 
C. People often turn to humorous ways when meeting with difficult situations because of its effectiveness. 
D. Only by adopting the means of humor can one succeed in some jobs. 
 Answer: C
Context: I never thought I would have a life-changing experience at Wal-Mart.
Although my thoughts were only on speed, the checkout line I was standing in wasn't moving as quickly as I wanted, and I glanced toward the cashier.
There stood a man in his seventies, wearing glasses and a nice smile. I thought, well, he's an old guy!
For the next few minutes I watched him. He greeted every customer before scanning the items. Sure, his words were the usual, ""How's it going?"" But he did something different--he actually listened to people. Then he would respond to what they had said and engage them in brief conversation.
I thought it was odd. I has grown accustomed to people asking me how I was doing simply out of robotic conversational habit. After a while, you don't give any thought to the question and just mumble something back. I could say, ""I just found out I have six months to live,"" and someone would reply, ""Have a great day!""
But that wasn't the end.
He gave them the change, walked around the counter, and extended his right hand in an act of friendship. He looked the customers in the eyes. ""I sure want to thank you for shopping here today,"" he told them. ""You have a great day. Bye-bye.""
The looks on the faces of the customers were priceless. There were smiles and some sheepish grins. All had been touched by his simple gesture--and in a place they never expected. They would gather their things and walk out, smiling.
Of course, he did the same to me and I got to know his name--Marty.
Who was that guy? It was as if Sam Walton had come back from the dead and invaded this old guy's body.
I had never walked away from that shop feeling like that. 
 Question:According to the writer, when common people ask you ""How's it going?"" 
A. they are just practicing their conversation ability 
B. they are inquiring about your private information 
C. they don't expect to hear any negative answers

A beautiful girl with a master degree in electric engineering became a winning candidate  through the difficult process of employment. At its last stage she faced an oral test together with another girl who was her equal not only in good looks but also in education standard. The girl we talk about was confident in herself and successful in the oral test. It seemed that she would get the chance. The examiner told her on behalf of the company that she could come to office of company next Monday as a new employee. At last he asked her, ""Have you anything else to say?

Context: The interview has been going on for about 20 minutes and everything seems to be going well.Then, suddenly, the interviewer asks an unexpected question, ""Which is more important, law or love?""
Job applicants in the West increasingly find themselves asked strange questions like this.And the signs are that this is beginning to happen in China.
Employers want people who are skilled, enthusiastic and devoted.So these are the qualities that any reasonably intelligent job applicant will try to show no matter what his or her actual feelings are.In response, employers are increasingly using the questions which try and show the applicant's true personality.
The question in the first paragraph comes from a test called the Kiersey Temperament Sorter.It is an attempt to discover how people solve problems, rather than what they know.This is often called aptitude   test.
According to Mark Baldwin of Alliance, many job applicants in China are finding this type of questions difficult.""When a Chinese fills out an aptitude test, he or she will think there is a right answer but they may fail because they try to guess what the examiner wants to see.""
This is sometimes called the prisoner's dilemma .Applicants are trying to act cleverly in their own interest, but they fail because they don't understand what the interviewer is looking for.Remember that in an aptitude test, the correct answer is the honest answer. 
 Question:What is the purpose of the passage? 
A. To give a piece of advice to job interviewees. 
B. To tell you how to deal with job interviews. 
C. To advise you how to find a good job. 
D. To describe an aptitude test.

Context: School education is very important and useful. The students both learn knowledge and get an education. Yet, no one can learn everything from school. The scientists,such as Edison,Newton,Galileo and Einstein, didn't learn everything from school. They learned a lot of knowledge outside school or in practice by themselves. A teacher, even he knows a lot, can't teach his students everything.
The teacher's job is to show his students how to learn, how to read and how to think. A good teacher with rich experience in teaching can teach his students the methods(="" ways)of"" study. Through these methods the students are able to learn and get a lot of things by themselves.
Usually it is very easy for the students to remember some knowledge, but it is very difficult to use it for problems. If a teacher really shows the students the ability of how to use knowledge, it means the teacher has learned lots of knowledge by himself (or herself). The success in learning shows he or she knows how to study.

Context: When I was in college, a man named Henry worked as a custodian  in our student union building. White-haired, with a Pennsylvania Dutch accent, Henry could usually be seen in a baseball cap, a T-shirt and a pair of jeans.
He was the custodian, and he was the most respected and most well-known person in the building. Everyone loved Henry, and it was because of all the implicit ways he expressed his love for everyone around him. Henry didn't have to say, ""I love you."" He lived his love.
Henry was always excited when he met someone new, and he wanted to know everything about them. He felt it was important to do things for people he valued. And Henry seemed to value everyone he met. He brought in articles or cartoons for certain people, went out of his way to introduce people to each other, kept dozens of names and birthdays in his wallet so he could send cards, and helped students keep in touch with graduates who had written to him. He even assisted students who didn't have enough money to buy their books. 
Henry taught me --- and many others he supported --- how to live life to the fullest. Not by skydiving or exploring some foreign countries, but by appreciating where you are in life and valuing those around you.
The funny thing is that despite all he did and taught us, Henry truly believed that he was the lucky one --- that he was the one who was gaining so much by getting to know us. But all of us who remember Henry know that we were the ones who were truly blessed. 
We will never forget the man who taught us that best way to say ""I love you"" often has little to do with the words. 
 Question:According to the passage, working as a custodian in a college, Henry   _  . 
A. made international travels to live a full life

Context: There is no such thing as ""the perfect parent"" and everyone has to learn how to educate their children. Parents may be annoyed by their kids and yell   at then, but they should be careful not to yell at the children.
Children need to be loved and cared for. They need positive encouragement, which will help them believe that they can succeed in their lives. This will also give them opportunities to explore and try out new things. If parents yell at their children, the emotional   development of them can be badly affected.
Though parents think they are protecting their children at all times, the children will not feel safe when they are yelled at. It can be a very bad experience for children. This can make it difficult for children to enjoy parents' presence   if they are being yelled at.
A person needs to be a good listener and also should learn to give others a chance to talk. When a child grows up with parents who often yell, this will not happen. When parents often yell, their children will also learn the same thing and they will find it natural not to listen to anyone.
The confidence   of a child is built up by his or her parents. There is no doubt that yelling will only decrease their confidence level. The words used while yelling can affect them greatly. They will not want to do anything without asking for their parents' permission. 
 Question:Which is the best title of the passage? 
A. Be a perfect parent 
B. Don't yell at your children 
C. Parents should learn how to educate the children 
D. Parents should protect their children

Context: One evening after dinner, Mr. and Mrs. Tisich called a family meeting. ""We've had to make a difficult decision,"" Mr. Tisich announced. ""You see, your mother has been offered a post as co-director of a television station in Chicago. Unfortunately, the station is not here. After thinking long and hard about it, we've concluded that the right decision is to move to Chicago."" Marc looked shocked, while his sister Rachel breathlessly started asking when they'd be moving. ""It's surprising, but exciting!"" she said. Marc simply said, ""We can't go--I can't leave all my friends. I'd rather stay here and live with Tommy Lyons!""
The Tisichs hoped that by the time they moved in August, Marc would grow more used to the idea of leaving. However, he showed no signs of accepting the news, refusing to pack his belongings. When the morning of the move arrived, Marc was nowhere to be found. His parents called Tommy Lyon's house, but Mrs. Lyons said she hadn't seen Marc. Mrs. Tisich became increasingly concerned, while her husband felt angry with their son for behaving so irresponsibly.
What they didn't know was that Marc had started walking over to Tommy's house, with a faint idea of hiding in Lyons's attic  for a few days. But something happened on the way as Marc walked past all the familiar landscape of the neighborhood: the fence that he and his mother painted, the tree that he and his sister used to climb, the park where he and his father often took evening walks together. How much would these mean without his family, who make them special in the first place? Marc didn't take the time to answer that question but instead hurried back to his house, wondering if there were any moving cartons the right size to hold his record collection. 
 Question:The reason for Marc's going home was that  _  . 
A. he did not want to be left behind 
B. he realized his family was important to him 
C. he hoped to reach an agreement with his parents

If they didn't pass, they would have to take the exams in September again. Some students failed, but Kate decided not to be one of them. She worked hard all day, but just before the exams she was working so hard that her sister was worried about her. She was staying up too late . The night before the first exam, Barbala insisted that she should have an early night and take a sleeping pill. She promised to wake her in the morning.
As she was falling asleep, Kate was worried in case she over-slept. Her mind kept jumping from subject to subject. At last, with the help of the pill, she fell asleep. she was sitting in the examination hall, looking at the paper. She couldn't answer any of the questions. Everyone round her was writing pages and pages. However hard she thought, she couldn't find anything to write about. She kept looking at her watch. Time was running out. There was only one hour left. She started one question, wrote two sentences, gave up and tried another one. With only half an hour left she wrote another two sentences. By this time she was so worried that she started crying. Her whole body shook(,). It shook so much that it woke her up. She was still in bed and it had all been a terrible dream. A minute later, Barbala called her name.

Context: My son Gilbert was eight years old and had been in the Cub Scouts   only a short time. Once he was handed a sheet of paper, a block of wood and four tires and told to return home and give them all to his father. That was not an easy task for Gilbert to do. The piece of paper was a set of instructions about how to build a wooden racing car. Gilbert's father laughed when he read the instructions. The block of wood remained untouched as the weeks passed.
Finally, I stepped in to see if I could figure it all out. Having no skills, I decided it would be best if I simply read the instructions and let Gilbert do the work. And he did. Within days, his block of wood was turning into a pinewood racing car.
Then the big night came. With his pinewood racing car in his hand and pride in his heart we headed to the big race. As the race was done in elimination fashion  , you could keep racing as long as you were the winner.
Finally, it was between Gilbert and the fastestlooking car there. As the race was about to begin, Gilbert asked if they could stop for a minute, because he wanted to pray. Then the race stopped.
Gilbert prayed in earnest for a very long minute. The Master came up to Gilbert and asked the obvious question, ""So you prayed to win, Gilbert?""
My young son answered, ""Oh, no Sir. It wouldn't be fair to ask God to help you beat someone else. I just asked him to make it so I don't cry when I lose.""
Children seem to have wisdom far beyond us. Perhaps we spend too much of our prayer time asking God to control the race, make us the champion, or remove us from the struggle, when we should be seeking God's strength to get through what lies in our way. 
 Question:Who finally made the pinewood racing car? 
A. Gilbert. 
B. Gilbert's father. 
C. Gilbert's mother. 
D. The whole family.

Context: Dar and I loved to dance. It was probably the first thing we did together, long before we would share our lives.
We grew up in a small Oregon mountain community where dances were held almost every Saturday night. Dar was seventeen and l was thirteen when we first danced. He was one of the best dancers on the floor, and so was I. We always jitterbugged. No slow dancing for us; nothing remotely romantic.
Our fathers would stand along the wall and watch. Every once in a while, Dar's dad would smile a little and say, to no one in particular, but my dad could hear, ""Boy, my kid can sure dance."" _ he acted like he'd never heard. But a while later he would say, to no one in particular, ""That girl of mine can sure dance.""
Our dancing together stopped for five years while Dar was in the South Pacific in World War II. When we met again, Dar was twenty-two, and l was eighteen. We began to date and dance again. We were as good together as we remembered, and this time we added slow dancing.
For us, life is a dance, a movement of rhythms, directions, stumbles, missteps, at times slow and precise, or fast and wild and joyous. We did all the steps.
Two nights before Dar died, the family were with us. We all ate dinner together, and Dar sat with us. He hadn't been able to eat for several days. After dinner, I put on a Nat King Cole tape. Dar took me in his arms, weak as he was, and we danced and smiled. No tears for us. We were doing what we had loved to do for more than fifty years. It was our last dance---forever unforgettable. I wouldn't have missed it for the world. 
 Question:The author first danced with Dar when  _  . 
A. they were still in their teens 
B. they began to date each other 
C. they began to share their lives 
D. Dar returned from the South Pacific

It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on. 
 Question:That man called after reading about what Jordan did to a disabled child because he wanted to   _  . 
A. become famous himself 
B. know why Jordan appeared in a poor area 
C. let the author know that Jordan was not that nice 
D. offer another example to show that Jordan was a nice man 
 Answer: C
Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""

Context: Riding was the favourite activity of Thomas Jefferson, who was the third President of the United States. He usually rode good horses.
One day, he was riding outside Washington, when a jockey   came near. He did not know the President, but his professional eye was attracted by Mr. Jefferson's horse. He stopped and said that he wanted to buy the horse, but Mr. Jefferson politely refused his offer.
The jockey offered more money for the horse, because the closer he looked at the horse, the more he liked it. All of his offers were refused, which made him angry. He then became rude, but his rudeness left as little an impression as his money, for Jefferson had a very good temper. At last, he hit Mr. Jefferson's horse with his whip, getting it to run suddenly. This would have thrown a less skillful rider to the ground, but Jefferson stayed on his seat, and controlled his horse well.
The jockey then gave up. He rode with Mr. Jefferson side by side and began to talk with him about politics. Jefferson joined in the conversation. When they got into the city and came close to the gate of the presidential mansion  , Mr. Jefferson stopped, and politely invited the man to enter.
The jockey was surprised and asked, ""Why? Do you live here?""
""Yes"" was the simple reply.
""Why, stranger, what's your name?""
""My name is Thomas Jefferson.""
Embarrassed, the man quickly left, while the President looked at him with a smile and then rode through the gate.

Context: Hetty Robinson learnt all about money when very young. As a child, she read the financial   pages of the newspaper to her rich father. Her father died when Hetty was 30, and she inherited $1 million. When she herself died in 1916, she left almost $100 million to her two children.
Hetty made her money on the New York stock   exchange. She was a financial genius. She made money so easily that people called her the Witch of Wall Street. But although she was one of the richest women in the world, she counted every cent and spent as little as possible. She didn't own a house, because she didn't want to pay taxes. So she and her children lived in cheap hotels. She spent almost nothing on clothes, and always wore the same long black dress. She washed it herself, but to save soap she only washed the bottom of the dress, where it touched the ground. Other people had their own offices, but Hetty used a desk in the bank where she kept her money, because it didn't cost anything. She sat in the bank and ate her sandwiches while she bought and sold stocks and shares. If the bank complained, she just moved all her money to another bank.
Hetty's family paid the price for her meanness. When she was 33 she married a millionaire, Edward Green, and they had two children. But Green lost all his money, so she left him. When her son, Ned, injured his knee, Hetty didn't want to pay for a doctor, so she took him to a free hospital for poor people. Unfortunately the doctor knew Hetty was rich and he asked for money. Hetty refused and took the boy away. His leg got worse and two years later doctors removed it.
But eventually Ned got his revenge  . At the age of 81, Hetty had an argument with a shop assistant about the price of a bottle of milk. She became so angry that she had a heart attack and died. So Hetty's meanness finally killed her. Ned inherited half his mother's fortune, and he spent it all on parties, holidays and expensive jewellery. 
 Question:Which of the following best describes Hetty Robinson? 
A. Gifted but not generous. 
B. Wealthy and selfless. 
C. Easy-going but selfish. 
D. Curious and lucky.

Context: In an American classroom, a Chinese girl was asked to answer a question. She stood up and smiled, without making any sound.

He didn't know that the girl smiled to cover her embarrassment because she wasn't able to answer the question.

Context: Dar and I loved to dance. It was probably the first thing we did together, long before we would share our lives.
We grew up in a small Oregon mountain community where dances were held almost every Saturday night. Dar was seventeen and l was thirteen when we first danced. He was one of the best dancers on the floor, and so was I. We always jitterbugged. No slow dancing for us; nothing remotely romantic.
Our fathers would stand along the wall and watch. Every once in a while, Dar's dad would smile a little and say, to no one in particular, but my dad could hear, ""Boy, my kid can sure dance."" _ he acted like he'd never heard. But a while later he would say, to no one in particular, ""That girl of mine can sure dance.""
Our dancing together stopped for five years while Dar was in the South Pacific in World War II. When we met again, Dar was twenty-two, and l was eighteen. We began to date and dance again. We were as good together as we remembered, and this time we added slow dancing.
For us, life is a dance, a movement of rhythms, directions, stumbles, missteps, at times slow and precise, or fast and wild and joyous. We did all the steps.
Two nights before Dar died, the family were with us. We all ate dinner together, and Dar sat with us. He hadn't been able to eat for several days. After dinner, I put on a Nat King Cole tape. Dar took me in his arms, weak as he was, and we danced and smiled. No tears for us. We were doing what we had loved to do for more than fifty years. It was our last dance---forever unforgettable. I wouldn't have missed it for the world. 
 Question:The author first danced with Dar when  _  . 
A. they were still in their teens 
B. they began to date each other 
C. they began to share their lives 
D. Dar returned from the South Pacific

Context: I have a friend named Monty Roberts who owns a horse ranch . He has let me use his house to put on fund-raising events. The last time I was there he introduced me by saying: ""I want to tell you a story. It all goes back to a story about a young man who was the son of an itinerant horse trainer who would go from stable to stable, race track to race track, farm to farm and ranch to ranch, training horses. As a result, the boy's high school career was continually interrupted. When he was a senior, he was asked to write a paper about what he wanted to be and do when he grew up.
""That night he wrote a seven-page paper describing his goal of someday owning a horse ranch. He wrote about his dream in great detail and he even drew a diagram of a 200-acre ranch, showing the location of all the buildings, the stables and the track. Then he drew a detailed floor plan for a 4,000-square-foot house that would sit on a 200-acre dream ranch.
""He put a great deal of his heart into the project and the next day he handed it in to his teacher. Two days later he received his paper back. On the front page was a large red F with a note that read, 'See me after class.'
""The boy with the dream went to see the teacher after class and asked, 'Why did I receive an F?' The teacher said, 'This is an unrealistic dream for a young boy like you. You have no money. You come from an itinerant family. You have no resources. Owning a horse ranch requires a lot of money. You have to buy the land. You have to pay for the original breeding stock and later you'll have to pay large stud fees. There's no way you could ever do it.' Then the teacher added, 'If you will rewrite this paper with a more realistic goal, I will reconsider your grade.'
""The boy went home and thought about it long and hard. He asked his father what he should do. His father said, 'Look, son, you have to make up your own mind on this. However, I think it is a very important decision for you.' Finally, after a week, the boy turned in the same paper, making no changes at all. He stated, 'You can keep the F and I'll keep my dream.' ""
Monty then turned to the group present and said, ""I tell you this story because you are sitting in my 4,000-square-foot house in the middle of my 200-acre horse ranch. I still have that school paper framed over the fireplace."" He added, ""The best part of the story is that two years ago that same schoolteacher brought 30 kids to camp out on my ranch for a week. When the teacher was leaving, he said, 'Look, Monty, I can tell you this now. When I was your teacher, I was something of a dream stealer. During those years I stole a lot of kids' dreams. Fortunately you had enough courage not to give up yours.' ""
""Don't let anyone steal your dreams. Follow your heart, no matter what,"" Monty at last concluded. 
 Question:Which of the following could best express the teacher's feelings when she said the words before leaving the ranch two years ago? 
A. Regretful and proud. 
B. Regretful and guilty. 
C. Honest and sorry. 
D. Embarrassed and proud. 
 Answer: A
Context: Several years ago ,Masaru Ibuka ,chairman of Sony ,was at a company planning a meeting. Suddenly he hdd a brilliant idea. He stopped the meeting and asked everyone present what would happen if Sony removed the recording function and 'speaker and sold headphones with a tape player instead. Almost everyone thought he was crazy. Still ,Ibuka kept thinking about his idea and worked at improving it The result, of course, turned out to be the wildly successful Sony Walkman.
Good ideas often start with a seemingly silly question. Bill Bowerman was making breakfast one day. As he stood there making waffles  for his son, he wondered what would happen if he poured rubber into his waffle iron. Later ,he tried it and the result looked something Like the bottom of most sports shoes we see today. Still, when he took this idea to several existing shoe companies, he was laughed at In fact, every single company turned him down. Though rather discouraged, Bowerman insisted and went on to form his own company, making NBKE athletic shoes.
Sometime good ideas grow out of frustration  .When Fred Smith was a student at Yale University, he had some paperwork that he needed to have delivered across the country the next day. Smith was amazed to find out that overnight delivery was impossible. He sat for a long while ,lost in thought Why couldn't there be a reliable overnight mail delivery service? He decided to design one. Smith did just that and turned his design into a class project His business professor gave him only a C for his efforts. However, Smith was not through. He improved the idea in that class project and finally turned them into one of the first and most successful overnight mail service in the world -- FedEx.
We know that each of these ideas led to a very successful product or service that has changed the way many of us live. The best questions are usually open-ended and are often silly, Children aren't afraid to ask such questions ,but adults frequently are. Think how different the world might be if people never asked "" silly"" questions! 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? 
A. Sony Walkman achieved great success with its recording function and speaker. 
B. Bill Bowerman was experimenting with rubber for large shoe companies. 
C. Shoe companies rejected Bill Bowerman as they failed to see the potential of Nike. 
D. Fred Smith got the idea of an overnight mail service from his own experience.

Context: A flock of hungry pigeons were flying across the sky in search of food. Having traveled a long distance, they felt tired and settled down on a tree.  Just below the tree, they saw grains strewn   all over the ground. The pigeons were happy to have found enough food to eat. All the pigeons came down from the tree and started eating the grains. As they were doing so, a huge net fell on them and trapped them all.
The pigeons were taken aback. They noticed a hunter sitting at a distance from the tree, a bow and arrow in hand. The pigeons realized it was the hunter who had trapped them in the net. The hunter got up and began to move towards the pigeons.
The leader of the pigeons spoke, ""Friends, we are in great trouble. The hunter will catch us if we do not act swiftly in a few seconds. There is only one _ available at this moment. Let all of us use our force together and fly up along with the net. If all of us use our force and fly together, we can fly carrying the net along with us. Let us start now.""
All the pigeons agreed with him and flew high carrying the net along with them. After traveling enough distance away from the hunter, the pigeons settled on a tree and carefully came out of the net one by one and thus escaped the evil design of the hunter. 
 Question:Who strewed the grains over the ground? 
A. A villager. 
B. The hunter. 
C. The pigeon. 
D. The writer.

Context: Liverpool city council   want to clear the city of fat pigeons  . They say that people are feeding the birds, which makes them fat. The pigeons get bigger because they normally eat seeds   and insects   for their main food, not high-fat junk food they are eating in the city centre.
The council want people to know that everyone who feeds the pigeons makes the streets crowded  with these birds. They hope to encourage the birds to move away from the city centre and into parks and open spaces.
Ten robotic birds have been brought into the city centre to scare the pigeons away and visitors are asked not to give the pigeons any food. The mechanical birds--known as 'robops'--will sit on the roofs of buildings. They can be moved around to different places. They look like a peregrine falcon, which is a bird that kills pigeons. They even make noises and flap their wings to scare the pigeons. They hope that the pigeons will go away before the city becomes the European Capital of Culture in two years.

Context: Canadian experts have found that so - called self - help books may actually do more harm than good to people who really need help.Researchers say that individuals   with low respect felt much worse after repeating positive statements about themselves.
In their study, psychologists Joanne Wood and John Lee sought to determine how positive thinking affected people with different levels of self - confidence.They questioned dozens of people both made and female, analyzed their self - worth and optimism by means of the standard psychological methods and then asked them to write down their thoughts and feelings.The scoring system ranged from 0 to 35.
During the experiment, the researchers asked a total of 68 participants to repeat the self-help book phrase, ""I am a lovable person."" After that they measured the participants' moods and their feelings about themselves.The results revealed that the participants in the low self - respect group who repeated the mantra  , were feeling much worse afterwards, when compared to other participants in low self - respect group who did not repeat the phrase.Those with low self - respect who repeated the phrase scored an average of 10 points.Their counterparts   with equally low self - respect who were not asked to repeat the statement, were able to score a little higher average of 17 points.
However, individuals with high self - respect reported feeling better after repeating the positive self - statement - but only slightly.They scored an average of 31 points, compared with an average of 25 for those with equally high self - respect who did not repeat the phrase.
Professor Wood urged those who promote self - help books, magazines and television shows to stop telling people that simply repeating a positive mantra could change one's life.First, people start following this idea and feel like they are not alone.They are told that all they have to do is just to read that book and then to repeat these positive statements in a hope that things will be better, and when it does not work for them and they realize that nothing gets better, then it is really frustration to people.
Researchers concluded: ""Repeating positive self - statements may benefit certain people such as individuals with high self - respect but discourage the very people who need confidence the most."" 
 Question:So - called self - help books do some good to  _  . 
A. people lacking confidence 
B. people with high self - respect 
C. people with problems to settle urgently 
D. people repeating positive self - statements

Context: Alice's mother died when Alice was five years old. Alice, who grew up to be my mother, told me that after her mother's death her family was too poor to even afford to give her a doll.
In December 2012, I had a job at a local bank. One afternoon, we were decorating the tree in the bank lobby . One of my customers approached me with her beautiful handmade dolls. I decided to get one for my daughter, Katie, who was almost five years old. Then I had an idea. I asked my customer if she could make me a special doll for my mother--one with gray hair and spectacles : a grandmother doll. And she gladly agreed.
A friend had told me that his dad who played Santa Claus would be willing to make a visit on Christmas morning to our home to deliver my Katie her presents, so I made some special arrangements.
Christmas Day arrived and at the planned time; so did Santa Claus. Katie was surprised that Santa had come to see her at her own house. As Santa turned to leave, he looked once more into his bag and found one more gift. As he asked who Alice was, my mother, surprised at her name being called, indicated that she in fact was Alice. Santa handed her the gift, with a message card that read:
For Alice:
I was cleaning out my sleigh  before my trip this year and came across this package that was supposed to be delivered on December 25,1953. The present inside has aged, but I felt that you might still wish to have it. Many apologies for the lateness of the gift.
Love,
Santa Claus
My mother's reaction was one of the most deeply emotional scenes I have ever seen. She couldn't speak but only held the doll she had waited fifty-nine years to receive as tears of joy ran down her cheeks. That doll, given by ""Santa"", made my mother the happiest ""child"" that Christmas. 
 Question:The best title for this passage could be   _  . 
A. A Doll from Santa 
B. An unforgettable Christmas 
C. A considerate daughter 
D. A help from Santa Claus

Context: In 1987, while serving as the public affairs officer at Fort Bragg, I would frequently visit the local high schools to speak to the students about the Army. As alieutenant colonel , I found it particularly rewarding to talk with the teenagers about the benefits of military service, if only for a few years of their lives.
During one of these visits, I reported to the secretary in the principal's office to let her know that I was here for the third-period class. I was a little surprised when she told me. ""The principal would like to see you before you go to the class.""
As I entered his office, I was greeted by a gentleman who appeared to be in his late thirties, and he welcomed me with a smile and a handshake. ""You don't remember me, do you?"" he said.
I looked closely at the face again and could not recall where we may have met before.
""You were my company commander in basic training at Fort Jackson in 1970,"" the principal said.
""Let me help you out,"" he suggested. ""You gave me a three-day pass to go home and see my newborn baby."" I immediately remembered the incident!
""Yes,"" I said. ""I remember now."" It was the only three-day pass I had issued because the soldiers were on their way to Vietnam immediately after they finished training. But I knew if I did not let him go home to see his son and _ , I would regret denying the opportunity he had to be with his family.
""Come on, Colonel. I'd like to introduce you to 'the baby'. He's in your third-period class. By letting me go see him, you gave me a reason to stay focused and to come home safe from that war. Thank you , sir.""
It was the most rewarding class I had ever given, and I had no problem in telling the students about the bonds of friendship and the values that Army life can provide...and that can last a lifetime. 
 Question:Why did the principal want to see the writer? 
A. He wanted to send his son to the Army. 
B. He felt sorry for causing the writer trouble. 
C. He was disappointed at the writer's lecture.

Context: Melissa and Roman McCoy were looking forward to the Christmas. But on December 5th, Roman got a phone call that changed everything. Melissa had been in a terrible car accident, and the doctor had little hope she would make it.
""He said the next six to eight hours were critical in determining whether she would live or not. And I just wept,"" Roman said. ""A lot of pressure built up inside, and I just dropped my cell phone on the ground when I heard that. It was the worst feeling that I've ever felt.""
Melissa, a college English professor, was on her way to class when her car hit into a mound of dirt and rolled over several times.
Roman recalled, ""I could only think how I am going to raise my kids without their mother. If she did live, how would I take care of her and my kids? The questions you never want to ask yourself, I had to face.""
Melissa survived the first night. She had injuries to her stomach and lungs and worse, she suffered severe injuries to her brain. She didn't recognize anyone, even her own husband.
""Over the next few days, she remained unresponsive to treatments. The brain surgeon never really gave us much hope.""
Days passed and Melissa didn't improve. Christmas Eve, Roman was by her side in the hospital. Then, he received a Christmas gift he would never forget.
""That evening, she woke up and was just as clear as before, recognized everybody, and was able to read. It was just amazing. I saw her bright smile and her sense of humor. The only way I could describe it is that the weight of the darkness that had hovered over me was just completely gone.""
Melissa quickly improved, and she is back to being a wife, mom, and professor. There is no sign of damage from the brain.
Melissa said, ""I thank him for everything now. It's not just 'thank you for my job, thank you for my children.' It's 'thank you for every aspect of my life.'"" 
 Question:What's the relationship between Melissa and Roman? 
A. Mother and son.

Context: Heather Jack and her family, including her two children, usually spend the Christmas holidays preparing a feast--for others to eat. Last Christmas Eve, they went to a house in the neighborhood and prepared a dinner for an elderly woman and her son, who has muscular dystrophy . They stayed for an hour and chatted before heading home to prepare for a visit from Santa  . 
""I think it is that kind of direct experience that many find so meaningful,"" says Heather, president and founder of The Volunteer Family, a Boston-based organization dedicated to matching families with volunteer opportunities, both during the holidays and year-round. ""It's a great way for parents to involve the kids.""
In a holiday season that stretches from before Thanksgiving to just after the New Year, it's nice to hear stories about people with their children giving instead of receiving. Last December Gary and Debra Danoff and their two teenage sons drove to the Washington, D. C. Jewish Community Center(JCC) and spent Christmas morning in the Center's kitchen preparing a feast for homeless shelters. 
By choosing to prepare meals for the homeless, the Danoffs bring together a belief in community service with their love of cooking, ""It feels good to prepare food with our kids for other people at Christmas,"" says Gary. ""We want them to know that many people don't have the ability to go to the supermarket and pick the foods they want to eat and pay for them.""
The Danoffs were in good company. Across the city, at least 1000 volunteers with their children went across the region to provide food to the poor people as part of the D. C. JCC's annual ""December 25th Day of Service"", now in its 22nd year. 
 Question:What does ""The Volunteer Family"" do? 
A. It matches families with volunteer opportunities. 
B. It supplies food and service to the poor families. 
C. It encourages parents to involve their kids in volunteer work. 
D. It earns much money by organizing volunteer families.

Context: Last weekend, my kids along with a few other kids from the neighborhood volunteered to help me wash my car. My 10-year-old daughter came up with the idea of washing other people's cars as well. It was pretty hot outside. She further wanted to give juice for a low cost but not free. I felt happy and decided to help her.
She asked me, ""What if we make this 'a smile car wash', mommy? ""I couldn't hold back my tears and encouraged her and other kids to go inside the house and come up with ideas. While I kept myself busy in drying the car, the kids walked up to me with a board of beautiful signs of smiles. They had ""Free Car Wash"" written on it and the theme of their exercise was ""Smile"". It was pretty natural to see a team of kids 5 to 11 years with the task to do something for others.
All that seemed natural and came right from their heart. Nothing seemed to matter to them: their playtime, and then heat outside--they just wanted to help and do something nice in the community!
I helped them make some fresh juice and brought out some waste materials to help clean cars. Passers-by were amazed and one even shouted at them saying ""Good kids"". One of them even tried giving them 5 dollars, which they refused. A pretty heart-warming scene!
The following weekend, I saw the idea of the week, the theme of which was ""Global Kindness"". I was moved by such wonderful and loving souls. They made me smile!
One of the slogans   on their flag was: ""Do not fear! Smile retrievers  are here."" 
 Question:Which of the following did NOT the writer do to help the kids? 
A. She supported the kids' ideas. 
B. She prepared some fresh juice for the passers-by. 
C. She brought out some waste materials to help the kids. 
D. She gave the kids some money.

Context: In classes, your teachers will talk about topics that you are studying. The information they provide will be important for you to know when you take tests. You must be able to take good written notes from what your teachers say.
Taking good notes has three stages. There are certain things you should do before class, during class, and after class. Here are the three stages of note-taking and what you should do during each class.
1. Get Ready to Take Notes
Review your notes from the previous  class before you come to class. This will help you remember what was covered and get you ready to understand the new information your teacher will provide.
Complete all assigned  readings before you come to class. Your teacher will expect that  you have done this and will use and build upon this information.
Bring all note-taking materials with you to class - several pens and pencils as well as your notebook.
2. Take Notes
Keep your attention on what your teacher is saying. Paying attention to ""signal statements"". Examples of signal statements are ""The most important point ..."" and ""Remember that ..,"" Be sure to include in your notes information that your teacher repeats or written on the blackboard.
Write quickly so that you can include all the important information in your notes. Do this by writing abbreviated   words such as med for medicine, using symbols such as % for percent, and writing short sentences. Place a ""?"" next to information about whose meaning you are not sure. 
 Question:What's the writer's purpose in writing this passage? 
A. To encourage us to listen carefully in class. 
B. To tell us the importance of taking notes. 
C. To tell us how to quickly improve our study. 
D. To give us some tips on how to take notes.

Do not go to bed late at night studying. Before you start answering in the exam, read carefully over the question papers, and try to understand the meaning of each question.

Context: ""Mom, you should put some of your things away. The house should be safe for the baby,"" said my son Mark as he walked upstairs with his wife and fifteen-month-old Hannah.
They visited us for the Thanksgiving holiday. After driving all day from Salt Lake to Ft. Collins, his temper showed. ""That one finger rule may work with other kids, but never Hannah,"" he insisted.
When my three granddaughters first moved into our house three years ago, my friend offered me her secret to behave grandchildren. ""Teach them the 'one finger rule'."" All of her five grandchildren learned it at a young age and it proved to also work well with mine. 
I picked up my granddaughter and said, ""Well, Mark, just watch."" I hugged her and walked all around the great room.
""Hannah, you may touch anything in this room you want, but, you can only use one finger."" I showed the technique by touching my forefinger to the sculpture. Hannah followed my example. ""Good girl. Now what else would you like to touch?""
She stretched her finger toward the lamp. I allowed her to touch everything in sight, plants, glass objects, TV, VCR, speakers, etc. If she started to grab , I gently reminded her to use one finger. She always obeyed. However, Hannah, an only child, possessed a more adventurous personality. Her father predicted it would prevent her from accepting the ""one finger rule"".
During their four-day stay, we aided Hannah in remembering ""one finger rule"". She learned quickly. 
Months later, my husband and I drove to Salt Lake. I watched Mark continue to practice the one finger rule. I smiled happily each time he asked Hannah to touch with ""one finger"". 
 Question:How many grandchildren mentioned in the passage have mastered the ""one finger rule""? 
A. 3.

Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""
It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on.

A. become famous himself

Her home was in the country, but she didn't want to go back there every night, so she bought an expensive house in the center of the city, got some beautiful furniture and got a man to paint the rooms in new colour.
It was very difficult to get tickets for her show in the evening, because everyone wanted to see it. So she decided to give the painter two of the best seats. She hoped that this would make him work better for her. He took the tickets without saying anything, and she heard no more about them until the end of month, when she got the painter's bill. At the bottom of it were these words: ""Four hours from 5:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. watching Miss Hall sing and dance: 3 pounds,"" with this note: ""Before 5:00 p.m. I get 10 shillings  an hour and after 5:00 p.m. 15 shillings.""

Context: One evening after dinner, Mr. and Mrs. Tisich called a family meeting. ""We've had to make a difficult decision,"" Mr. Tisich announced. ""You see, your mother has been offered a post as co-director of a television station in Chicago. Unfortunately, the station is not here. After thinking long and hard about it, we've concluded that the right decision is to move to Chicago."" Marc looked shocked, while his sister Rachel breathlessly started asking when they'd be moving. ""It's surprising, but exciting!"" she said. Marc simply said, ""We can't go--I can't leave all my friends. I'd rather stay here and live with Tommy Lyons!""
The Tisichs hoped that by the time they moved in August, Marc would grow more used to the idea of leaving. However, he showed no signs of accepting the news, refusing to pack his belongings. When the morning of the move arrived, Marc was nowhere to be found. His parents called Tommy Lyon's house, but Mrs. Lyons said she hadn't seen Marc. Mrs. Tisich became increasingly concerned, while her husband felt angry with their son for behaving so irresponsibly.
What they didn't know was that Marc had started walking over to Tommy's house, with a faint idea of hiding in Lyons's attic  for a few days. But something happened on the way as Marc walked past all the familiar landscape of the neighborhood: the fence that he and his mother painted, the tree that he and his sister used to climb, the park where he and his father often took evening walks together. How much would these mean without his family, who make them special in the first place? Marc didn't take the time to answer that question but instead hurried back to his house, wondering if there were any moving cartons the right size to hold his record collection. 
 Question:The reason for Marc's going home was that  _  . 
A. he did not want to be left behind 
B. he realized his family was important to him 
C. he hoped to reach an agreement with his parents

Context: It was the Year from Hell - the dog died, my marriage of 24 years ended, and my house burned down. I had moved into a new rented house with my youngest son after my husband and I divorced. We'd been in the house just six weeks. I went to a dinner party one night, and as I drove home near, I saw smoke rising into the sky. I wondered whether it was my house. Then I turned the corner, and sure enough, it was my house.
My son and I stayed with a friend for a couple of nights. Then my friend Gail heard about the fire, called me up, and said, ""Come and move into my house. I have seven bedrooms and five bathrooms - plenty of space for you and your son."" Gail had three kids at home, but there was still plenty of room for me and my son, Sutton. Little did I know that her offer of a temporary place to stay would turn into a living arrangement that lasted two and a half years.
We were two single mothers. Gail and I spent the next couple of years sorting out a lot of things together. After we moved in, I soon began to look for a permanent place to live in. Gail said, ""Please don't leave. I've never had so much freedom!"" Having me in the house meant someone to help take care of her kids, someone to share cooking and gardening, and someone to share day-to-day life. She loved having me there, and I loved being there. So we stayed.
It was an important chapter in my life. We both needed time to heal from our divorces. It was a time of deeper insight and spiritual growth for both of us. Gail's generosity was more than anyone could expect from a friend. I am eternally grateful to have a friend like Gail. I'm also grateful for the lessons I learned from the fire and the other losses that came so suddenly, so fast. Much to my surprise, I found gratitude among the ashes. I was tested serious trial by fire. But, like a phoenix, I rose from the ashes strong and whole. I would not be the person I am today if not for that Year from Hell. 
 Question:Which of the following could be the title of the passage? 
A. The Year from Hell. 
B. My Generous Friend - Gail. 
C. Gratitude among the Ashes. 
D. Everything Gone in the Smoke.

Context: When John Weston awoke that morning, he remembered that his mother was going into hospital. He hadn't worked out quite what was wrong with her. He knew, though that she hadn't been well for some time now, and it had become almost familiar to him to see her eyes narrowed in a sudden attack of pain, and her hand pressing against her heart. Their own doctor, who she had finally gone to for advice, had sent her to an expert who knew all about these things. He had told her that just as soon as there was a bed for her, she would have to come into his hospital where he could look after her himself.
During the weeks since then the pains had come even more frequently, and the narrowed eyes became an almost permanent part of her expression. Always rather sharp, she began losing her temper over little things so that John's father kept his thoughts to himself more and more. John, as ready as possible to make allowances, tried to think what it would be like to have toothache all the time and how bad-tempered that would make you.
So his mother would go into hospital for a few days. He was going to stay with his Aunt Daisy till she came back, and his father would stay on at home by himself. John's cousin, Mona, was to come in and make the bed and wash the pots and dust round now and again. That was the arrangement, and John didn't care much for it. Apart from missing his mother(and he was glad she was going away because they would make her better), he wasn't very fond of his Aunt Daisy because she was even more bad-tempered than his mother. 
 Question:Mrs Weston went to see her doctor  _  . 
A. as soon as she realized that something was wrong 
B. only after her husband advised her to 
C. a long time after the trouble began

Context: Remember those big, colorful books with large pictures of balls or apples when you were a little kid? Those have proven to be helpful, according to a number of studies. Between 1 and 5 years old, introducing books to Children can help greatly because this is usually the age when intellectual   capabilities form.
At age 1 to 5, a child can decide whether he wants to learn or wants to be a good learner. The road to learning starts here. Their curiosity   and imagination are fed with the many pictures, sounds and colors in the books.
Children normally began school at 5 years old. But today, they go to school when they are as young as one and a half years old. This is because many parents have recognized that influencing the child's formative years   is very important. The fight influence can make the child want to read in the future.
Parents should play a part in encouraging children to read. Even just reading them bedtime stories can help children feel the joy and amazement connected to reading. This can help them become better readers and better learners as they grow older.
If children are interested in reading books rather than watching television, they can improve many skills besides reading and learning. Books can act as stepping stones to intelligence. However, parents must be very careful not to overpower their children. If they force children to read books that are too hard to understand, they might think reading is boring and lose interest in it. 
 Question:. This passage mainly   _  . 
A. advises kids to spend less time watching TV 
B. explains why reading is good for us 
C. tells us that reading is good for children 
D. suggests that parents spend more time with their kids

Context: When I was at university,  I studied very hard. But a lot of my friends did very little work. Some did just enough to pass exams. Others didn't do quite enough. Fred Baines was one of them.

""Oh good,"" he said, ""Have you got the results of the test?""
The professor looked at him and smiled.
""Ah, it's you, Baines, just a minute.""

Context: Autumn and winter are cold and flu seasons. Will the old advice about dressing warmly help prevent a cold, or if you get sick, should you follow the old saying, ""feed a cold and starve a fever?"" And what about that fever? Should you take medicine to reduce your temperature, or is it better to let the body treat the fever itself? Everyone seems to have an answer. But is popular wisdom valuable?
Doctor Nelson knows a lot about cold and flu seasons. Nelson says research may be just starting to provide proofs for long-held beliefs. For example, scientists for years were against the idea that getting cold and wet might cause colds or flu. But recent studies have shown that cold temperatures cause stress on the body, and that stress can create conditions more inviting to viruses. So maybe it does make sense to wrap up warmly before going outside.
And what about feeding a cold and starving a fever? Nelson says if you have a cold and are hungry, you should eat. But a fever, especially a high one, suggests a more serious problem. He says people are usually not hungry when they have a high fever. Eating might even make a person sick. But drinking enough water is important. A fever easily makes the body lose water.
Finally, when should you treat a fever? Nelson says a fever should be treated if it stays at
40degC or above for a day or more. A high temperature can damage brain cells. The doctor also believes in treating a fever if it prevents a person from sleeping.
Medicine like aspirin, for example, can be used to reduce pain and fever. But aspirin should not be given to children because it can cause serious problems. 
 Question:According to Doctor Nelson, if someone catches a fever, he should  _  . 
A. bathe in cold water 
B. drink enough water 
C. try to eat something 
D. take some exercise outside 
 Answer: B
Context: It will be hot--hot enough that most locals will have cleared town for cooler places. But because athletes competing at the 2004 Olympics have no choice but to stay in the hot weather, many plan to turn to science to stay cool.
Some will put their hands in ice water just before competing and nearly all will be wearing fabrics  designed with hot weather in mind.
""Normally we warm up before exercise,""said Gordon Sleivert, director of sports science and medicine at the Canadian Sport Center in Victoria, British Columbia.""But in this case we're taking the warm out of warm up. It's like pre-cooling.""
Experts are predicting  the average high this August in Athens will be 90 degrees Fahrenheit, with temperatures often reaching above 100(the average temperature in Sydney for the 2000 summer games was 64).
Although some events, such as the marathon, will start early(1 a.m.) to avoid hot weather, _        Drinking lots of water will help athletes keep cool, but humidity  remains a problem. The body's ability to cool down is weakened by damp air since sweat drips off the skin rather than evaporates ,resulting in dehydration  without the cooling.
""Getting hot is a real problem because when our brains heats up, the brain waves are more like when you're really sleepy. Everything feels harder,"" said Sleivert. 
 Question:The passage mainly tells us that   _  . 
A. why it is very hot in Athens 
B. the hot weather is a big problem for Olympic athletes 
C. how important science is to every athlete 
D. the Olympics will be put off because of the hot weather

Context: There is a big question making the rounds  among the parents at my daughter's class. Should the kids refer to the parents' friends as ""Mr. Jones"" or ""Mrs. Smith"", rather than using their first names? I was quite shocked, having come from a home where it would have been unheard of to refer to one of my parents' friends by their first names. This was reserved for only the closest of family friends and  s, and even they always had ""Aunt"" or ""Uncle"" in front their name.
    Respect is something that is earned. Unlike many of the other virtues we try to nurture in our kids, respect is a bit more complicated. It is not only necessary when dealing well with others, but the virtue of self-respect is critical for kids to succeed and feel good about themselves and their choices throughout their lives.
    There are several factors that can have a big impact on kids and their ability to be respectful. The first one to consider is manners. Calling adults by their surnames, setting proper examples during sporting events and while driving, and how we talk to each other in our homes all can have an enormous effect on a child's concept of respect and how important it is. Many of these seemingly trivial ideas have become almost outdated, but one should seriously consider the value of these ideas before casting(          ) them aside. It is easy to become unaware of these behaviors. Try to keep track of how often your child is subjected to  this kind of disrespect.
    The media, as you may have guessed, plays a large part in the increase in disrespect. Movies are equally to blame, with a PG movie often containing an abundant amount of  _ language.
    These factors and others all contribute to an alarming increase in disrespect in society. If we don't step in and change course, we will find living in a morally respectful culture unlikely. 
 Question:What does the author think of kids' referring to parents' friends by their first names? 
A. It is common in his family. 
B. It is OK if the friends are close. 
C. Such behavior lacks respect. 
D. Such behavior sounds funny. 
 Answer: C
Context: My son was a second-grader. He went to school by bus every day. He was the first student on in the morning, as we were farthest from school, and the last student off in the evening. I was a teacher myself and it was a comfort to realize the school staff   were all working as hard as I was to provide a safe learning environment.
One day I came home from work and waited for my son to get home for a long time. Then I called the school. ""Perhaps he's just a bit late,"" said the secretary. ""I will call the driver to see if those children are home."" A few minutes later, I answered the phone to hear that the other students were home. Then I called his friends' parents, to see if perhaps he had gotten off at their stop to play. The answers were all ""No.""
By that time, it was dark and I was scared. My home was in the mountain areas, and it was said that a wolf had come up somewhere. My husband wasn't at home, so I forced myself to calm down and decided to go out to look for him. I was about to go out when the telephone rang; it was from the driver. ""He's okay,"" I heard. ""He was asleep on the seats in the back, under a couple of jackets. Since it's dark, can he spend the night with my family?""
I was relieved and agreed. Since my son had a great adventure, the school started giving a copy of the list to the driver, so he could check off the children's names when they got off the bus. I think highly of the school for taking the cautionary   step ahead; it is a sign of their concern for students, parents, and staff.

Context: Two good friends, Sam and Jason, met with a car accident on their way home one snowy night. The next morning, Sam woke up blind. His legs were broken. The doctor, Mr Lee, was standing by his bed, looking at him worriedly. When he saw Sam awake, he asked, ""How are you feeling, Sam?"" Sam smiled and said, ""Not bad, Doctor. Thank you very much for doing the special operation ."" Mr Lee was moved by Sam. When he was leaving, Sam said, ""Please don't tell Jason about it."" ""Well...Well...OK,"" Mr Lee replied.

Things went from bad to worse. Sam died a year later. When Jason came, Mr Lee gave him a letter from Sam. In the letter Sam said, ""Dear Jason, I am disabled. But I want you to be a healthy man. So I gave my eyes to you so that you can enjoy life as a healthy man. Now you have new friends. I'm glad to see that you are as healthy and happy as usual. I'm glad you live a happy life. You are always my best friend... Sam"". When he finished reading the letter, Mr Lee said, ""I have promised that I will keep this a secret until Sam is gone. Now you know it.""

Context: ""But what if I break my arm again?"" my 5-year-old daughter asked. I knew how much she wanted to learn to ride. Yet ever since she'd fallen off her bike and broken her arm, she'd been afraid.
""Oh honey,"" I said. ""I don't think you'll break another arm.""
""But I could, couldn't I?""
""Yes,"" I admitted, and found myself struggling for the right thing to say. ""I don't think I want to ride,"" she said and got off her bike.
We walked away and sat down beside a tree.
""Don't you want to ride with your friends?"" I asked. ""And I thought you were hoping to start riding your bike to school next year,"" I added.
""I was,"" she said in a low voice.
""You know, honey,"" I said. ""Most everything you do comes with dangers. You could break your arm at gymnastics. Do you want to stop going to the gym?"" ""No, of course not!"" she replied. And with a determined spirit, she stood up and agreed to try again. I held on to the back of her bike until she found the courage to say, ""Let's go!""
I spent the rest of the afternoon at the park watching a very brave little girl overcome a fear, and congratulating myself for being an independent single parent.
As we walked home, pushing the bike as we made our way along the sidewalk, she asked me about a conversation she'd overheard me having with my mother the night before.
""Why were you and Grandma arguing last night?""
""It's nothing."" I told her.
She shrugged  . ""Grandma said she just wanted you to find someone to love.""
""What Grandma wants is for some guy to break my heart again,"" I snapped.
""But Mom ...""
""You're too young to understand."" I told her.
She was quiet for the next few minutes. Then she looked up and in a small voice said, ""So I guess love isn't like a broken arm.""
Unable to answer, we walked the rest of the way in silence. When I got home, I let go and agreed to meet a man called Steve.
Steve was the man for me. We married less than a year later. It turned out my mother and my daughter were right. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?

Martin explained that if Pablo worked longer hours and caught more fish, he could make more money. With the extra money, Pablo could buy more boats and catch money more fish. By selling the fish, Pablo could open his own factory and sell direct to supermarkets.

Context: ""Linda, if beating yourself up were an Olympic sport, you'd win a gold medal!""
Annabel, my close friend, stunned(...)me with that frank observation after I told her how I had mishandled a situation with a student in a third-grade class where I was substituting . ""I should never have let him go to the boy's room without a pass! It was my fault he got into trouble with the hall monitor! I'm so stupid!""
My friend burst out laughing, and then made her ""Olympic"" comment. After a brief period of reflection I had to admit that she was right. I did put myself down an awful lot. Why, just during the previous day I had called myself ""a slob"" for having some papers spread out on my desk, ""ugly"" when I left the house without makeup and ""an idiot"" when I left the house for an emergency substitute job without my emergency lesson plan.
In a more reflective tone, Annabel said, ""I once took a workshop at church where the woman in charge had us list all the mean things we say about ourselves.""
""How many did you have on your list?"" I asked.
""Fifteen,"" she confessed. ""But then the teacher said, 'Now turn to the person next to you and say all the items on your list as if you were speaking to that person!' ""
My jaw dropped,""What did you do?""
""Nothing. Nobody did. We all just sat there, until I said, 'I could never say these things to anyone else!' ""
""And our teacher replied, 'Well, if you can't say them to anyone else, then don't ever say them to yourself!' ""

Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""
It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on. 
 Question:That man called after reading about what Jordan did to a disabled child because he wanted to   _  . 
A. become famous himself 
B. know why Jordan appeared in a poor area 
C. let the author know that Jordan was not that nice

Context: Last summer, when Amanda R of Anaheim Hills, California, was running on a cross-country course with her team, she blacked out. ""I got really dizzy,"" she says. ""I was out for a few minutes."" At first, Amanda thought she was just tired and didn't think she had a health problem. She did go to the emergency room, where she was fine after tests, but she fainted   again several days later as she was talking with her coach. Another doctor guessed that Amanda had blacked out ""because we were in heat so much with not enough water and not enough of the right kind of foods"".
Teens often don't want to stop and take a break or don't notice when they start to feel bad, doctors say. However, paying attention if you're not feeling well is important, as Amanda learned.
As a result, Amanda has changed her habits. ""I drink a lot more water,"" she says. ""And put more salt in my diet. I'm eating more balanced meals."" Amanda advises teen athletes to trust their coaches and speak up when they're not feeling well. ""And recognize the difference between when you're tired and when there's something really wrong.""

Context: Zoe Chambers was a successful PR(Public Relations) consultant and life was going well--she had a great job, a beautiful life in London. Then one evening in June last year, she received a text message telling her she was out of work. ""The first two weeks were the most difficult to live through,"" she said. ""After everything I'd done for the company, they dismiss me by text! I was so angry and I just didn't feel like looking for another job. I hated everything about the city and my life.""
Then, Zoe received an invitation from an old school friend, Kathy, to come and stay. Kathy and her husband, Huw, had just bought a farm in north west Wales. Zoe jumped at the chance to spend a weekend away from London, and now, then months later, she is still on the farm.
""The moment I arrived at Kathy's farm, I loved it and I knew I wanted to stay."" said Zoe. ""Everything about my past life suddenly seemed meaningless.""
Zoe has been working on the farm since October of last year and says she has no regrets. ""It's a hard life, physically very tiring."" she says. ""In London I was stressed and often mentally exhausted. But this is a good, healthy tiredness. Here, all I need to put me in a good mood is a hot bath and on of Kathy's wonderful dinners.""
Zoe says she has never bored on the farm. Every day brings a new experience. Kathy has been teaching her how to ride a horse and she has learnt to drive a tractor. Since Christmas, she has been helping with the lambing-watching a lamb being born is unbelievable. She says, ""It's one of the most moving experiences I've ever had. I could never go back to city life now ""

Context: Answers to life can be found in everyday events. Watching nature, watching people and watching animals communicate with each other provide some of the simplest ways to life's biggest problems.
This became clearer to me yesterday. It caused me to ask myself, ""How do I respond   to the storms in life?""
People usually run when it starts to rain. I love to walk in it, stand on my front door and feel it. I grew up doing it and have never really felt the fear many people do.
The animal world senses changes in the weather far earlier than humans. My dog, Ricky, begins to shake long before the storm is close enough to be noticed. I was about to feed my three dogs yesterday and as usual, I let them out in the yard first. They didn't move when thunder came across the skies. So I placed their food in their bowls and called Ricky into the kitchen.
Ricky was just standing there in place next to his bowl. The thunder became louder, which forced him to stop eating his meal. Then I watched Phil. He made his way across the kitchen floor and stood over Ricky's bowl. He ate all the remaining food. Generally, if Ricky was standing there, he wouldn't dare   come close. But today, he took advantage   of the storm and got what he wanted. His hope for the prize outweighed   his fear of the storm.
That's when it hit me. As men, we face all kinds of storms. They come in unannounced. Sometimes we stay in a corner or under the blankets, hoping it will all pass. However, if you dare put your head out, you'll discover there're people doing what they must to get what they must have out of life. Isn't it time you decided to take advantage of the storm? 
 Question:According to the writer, answers to life   _  . 
A. are difficult to find 
B. lie around us 
C. are simple to understand 
D. make people become fearless

Context: Linda was kind of late. Linda, 25, had a lot to do at work, plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Linda felt weak and tired -- maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks.
Several yards away, Frank, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying.
But when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, ""Oh, my God, she fell in!""Frank didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. ""No ! Not you ! ""his girlfriend screamed after him.
She was right to be alarmed. By the time Frank reached Linda, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station.
It was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the arms and drag her away from the edge. That was where Linda briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse.
Linda thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in.
Police and fire officials soon arrived, and Frank told the story to an officer. Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40minute train ride downtown--just as he had been seconds after the rescue, which made her think about her reaction at the time. ""I saw the train coming and I was thinking he was going to die, "" she explained. 
 Question:How did Frank save Linda? 
A. By helping her rise to her feet. 
B. By lifting her to the platform. 
C. By pulling her along the ground.

Context: What could make Michael Jordon, one of the greatest basketball players in history, shed tears?  It was when he became a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame on September 11. The hall is in Springfield, Massachusetts and honors the best basketball players, greatest coaches and other contributors to the game. ""The game of basketball has been everything to me ,"" said Jordan, 46. ""It is the place I have always gone when I needed to find comfort and peace.""
Jordan retired twice in his 15-year career, finishing with 32292 points, the third highest total points in NBA history behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone. His average of 30.12 points a game is the best in the League.
""One day you might look up and see me playing the game at 50,"" Jordan said. ""Because limits, like fears, are often just an illusion.""   In other words, it was motivation that made Jordan such a success..
A great career did not mean a smooth one. His high school coach cut him from the team in favor of a taller player when Jordan was in 10thgrade. His college coach wouldn't allow him on the cover of Sports Illustration in 1981 with North Carolina's four other players because Jordan was a freshman. In his first NBA All-Star game, older NBA stars wouldn't throw him the ball because of jealousy.
""That burned me up,"" Jordan said. ""But _ don't have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it."" 
 Question:When Jordan became a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame,  _ 
A. he found something more encouraging . 
B. he was so excited that he couldn't hold his tears back. 
C. he was happy and sad at the same time. 
D. he felt very comfortable and peaceful. 
 Answer: B
Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""
It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on. 
 Question:That man called after reading about what Jordan did to a disabled child because he wanted to   _  . 
A. become famous himself 
B. know why Jordan appeared in a poor area 
C. let the author know that Jordan was not that nice 
D. offer another example to show that Jordan was a nice man

Context: Benjamin Franklin is remembered as an inventor, author, statesman, and signer of the Declaration of Independence. But all great people were kids once and got into naughty. In writing about his life, Franklin recalled a youthful event that he later regretted.

Ben described his duties as ""cutting wick  for the candles, filling the dipping mold .But of course he preferred playing outdoors with his friends.
One such plot is told here in his own words.
""There was a saltwetland that bounded part of the millpond, on the edge of which, at high water, we used to stand to fish for minnows . By much abuse, we had made it a only quagmire . My proposal was to build a wharf  there fit for us to stand upon, and I showed my comrades a large pile of stones, which were intended for a new house near the wetland, and which would very well suit our purpose. Accordingly, in the evening, when the workmen were gone, I gathered a number of my playfellows, and working with them diligently like so many ants, sometimes two or three to a stone, we brought them all away and built our little wharf. The next morning the workmen were surprised at missing the stones, which were found in our wharf. Inquiry was made after the removers;we were discovered and complained of;several of us were corrected by our fathers;and, though I pleaded the usefulness of the work, mine convinced me that nothing was useful which was not honest.""

Context: Mothers and daughters go through so much--yet when was the last time a mother and daughter sat down to write a book together about it all? Perri Klass and her mother, Sheila Solomon Klass, both gifted professional writers, prove to be ideal co-writers as they examine their decades of motherhood, daughterhood, and the wonderful ways their lives have overlapped  .
Perri notes with amazement how closely her own life has mirrored her mother's: both have full-time careers; both have published books, articles, and stories; each has three children; they both love to read. They also love to travel--in fact, they often take trips together. But in truth, the harder they look at their lives, the more they acknowledge their big differences in circumstance and basic nature.
A child of the Depression  , Sheila was raised in Brooklyn by parents who considered education a _ for girls. Starting with her college education, she has fought for everything she's ever accomplished. Perri, on the other hand, grew up privileged in the New Jersey suburbs of the 1960s and 1970s. For Sheila, wasting time or money is a crime, and luxury is unthinkable while Perri enjoys the occasional small luxury, but has not been successful at trying to persuade her mother into enjoying even the tiniest thing she likes.
Each writing in her own unmistakable voice, Perri and Sheila take turns exploring the joys and pains, the love and bitterness, the minor troubles and lasting respect that have always bonded them together. Sheila describes the adventure of giving birth to Perri in a tiny town in Trinidad where her husband was doing research fieldwork. Perri admits that she can't sort out all the mess in the households, even though she knows it drives her mother crazy. Together they compare thoughts on bringing up children and working, admit long-hidden sorrows, and enjoy precious memories.
Looking deep into the lives they have lived separately and together, Perri and Sheila tell their mother-daughter story with honesty, humor, enthusiasm, and admiration for each other. A written account in two voices, Every Mother Is a Daughter is a duet   that produces a deep, strong sound with the experiences that all mothers and daughters will recognize. 
 Question:How are women's lives explored in this book? 
A. In a musical form. 
B. Through field research. 
C. With unique writing skills. 
D. From different points of view. 
 Answer: D
Context: For every woman who feels like she's had to scale back her personal ambitions since becoming a mother, gold medal cyclist Kristin Armstrong has a message: Don't give up on your dreams.
She retired after winning gold in Beijing to start a family; son Lucas arrived in 2010, but then she decided to compete again in the London Olympics. She won a gold medal at last.
The decision to start training again wasn't easy. ""I struggled with that a lot,"" she told a newspaper. ""At the beginning I felt selfish, I felt like, 'Well, I'm not supposed to be thinking of myself anymore. It's all supposed to be for my kid.'""
She faced physical challenges of getting back into competition shape after giving birth, as well. When she started racing in the spring of 2011, she was still breast-feeding; she would nurse her son, then race, then breast-feed again after the race. Her days revolved around Lucas and training.
""I feel like I'm able to do what I love to do and still manage a family and have that balance,"" Armstrong said. ""That you have a family or a child doesn't mean that you have to stop going after what you dream of individually.""
Armstrong makes balance look easy, whether it's on her bike or as an athlete-mom. But she points out that you can't have it all without making some sacrifices. For example, don't expect a neat home--her husband, Joe Savola, who she describes as her support system and her ""protector"", says he's had to give up on trying to keep everything orderly at home and just accept that their living room has become Lucas's playroom. For Armstrong, she's sacrificed time with friends who had kids around the same age--there just wasn't time.
Now, she says, ""That sounds like fun to me."" As she heads home to Boise, Idaho, she's ready to do regular mom stuff. 
 Question:In most days of 2011, Armstrong could be described as   _  . 
A. a housewife and a new mom 
B. an athlete and a career woman 
C. a parent and a sportswoman 
D. a wife and a good mother

On Saturday morning we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron had come along with two friends,Kevin and Simon,while sisters Carole and Lynn had come with Amanda. There were some other members I didn't know. We had come from different places and none of us knew the area.
We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors,but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing and then we changed at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves  first. Climbing out was harder than going in,but after a good deal of pushing, we were out at last.

Context: How do you pay for things? Do you usually use cash , or do you like to pay by credit card ? If you are like a lot of people, you probably have at least one credit card. Also, you might use it more often than you probably should.
Credit cards first became popular in the 1920s, At that time, businesses, such as hotels and companies, gave credit cards to their best customers . Unlike today's credit cards, customers could only use these cards at the Store or business that gave out the card. Customers had to pay for things in full. They couldn't pay for something a little at a time.
In 1950, a businessman named McNamara started a credit card company -- Diners Club. Unlike earlier credit cards, this card could be used by customers at many restaurants. Customers liked the card because they didn't have to carry a lot of cash with them. Restaurant owners liked the card, too. Why? They found out that customers usually spent more money when they could pay by credit card.
In its first year of business, Diners Club _ 200 cards, The customers who got the cards from the Diners Club could use them at 27 different restaurants. Today, Diners Club has about 8 million customers, and they can use their cards in over 7. 6 million businesses in more than 200 countries. 
 Question:What can we know about the earlier credit cards from the passage? 
A. They could be used everywhere. 
B. Customers had to pay for things in full. 
C. They were very popular before the 1920s. 
D. Everyone could get this kind of credit card.

Context: (2013*,B)On a sunny day last August,Tim heard some shouting.Looking out to the sea carefully,he saw a couple of kids in a rowboat were being pulled out to sea.
Two 12yearold boys,Christian and Jack,rowed out a boat to search for a football.Once they'd rowed beyond the calm waters,a beach umbrella tied to the boat caught the wind and pulled the boat into open water.The pair panicked and tried to row back to shore.But they were no match for _ and the boat was out of control.
Tim knew it would soon be swallowed by the waves.
""Everything went quiet in my head,""Tim recalls .""I was trying to figure out how to swim to the boys in a straight line.""
Tim took off his clothes and jumped into the water.Every 500 yards or so,he raised his head to judge his progress.""At one point,I considered turning back,"" he says.""I wondered if I was putting my life at risk.""After 30 minutes of struggling,he was close enough to yell to the boys,""Take down the umbrella!""
Christian made much effort to take down the umbrella.Then Tim was able to catch up and climb aboard the boat.He took over rowing,but the waves were almost too strong for him.
""Let's aim for the pier ,""Jack said.Tim turned the boat toward it.Soon afterward,waves crashed over the boat,and it began to sink.""Can you guys swim?""he cried.""A little bit,""the boys said.
Once they were in the water,Tim decided it would be safer and faster for him to pull the boys toward the pier.Christian and Jack were wearing life jackets and floated on their backs.Tim swam toward land as water washed over the boys'faces.
""Are we almost there?""they asked again and again.""Yes,""Tim told them each time.
After 30 minutes,they reached the pier.

B. To get back their football.

Context: On an August afternoon last year, Pamela Rivers, 40, and her friend Rita Graham, 38, were stopped at a red light on Cobb's Creek Parkway in South Philadelphia when a white SUV traveling in the opposite direction turned across traffic in front of them. It then jumped the curb   and rushed through a grassy expanse   before plunging down an embankment   toward Cobb's Creek. Pamela quickly pulled over, jumped out of her car, and dialed 911.
Kenny Gibson, 23, and his friend Taron Green, 25, were driving home from a job when Rita flagged them down. Kenny stopped, and the men got out of the car and looked over the cliff. The SUV had landed upside down in five feet of water. A woman's leg could be seen swinging out the driver's side window.
""I have a fear of water,"" Kenny said now. ""I almost drowned when I was nine."" Even so, he and Taron hurried down the 50-foot embankment into the muddy water. ""I couldn't just leave her,"" he adds.
The men waded out to the car and saw that the woman, Cheryl Allison, 61, was partially in water. Kenny tried unsuccessfully to open the door. Then he broke the window. But when he reached in to pull out Cheryl, he found she was trapped by the seat belt.
""Run back to the truck and grab a box cutter ,"" Kenny yelled to Taron. Meanwhile, Kenny tried in vain to push the car onto its side to create an air pocket for Cheryl.
That's when mechanic Marcell Porter approached the site. ""I flipped into rescue mode,"" he said. When Taron returned, Kenny cut through the seat belt with the box cutter. He and Marcell tried to pull Cheryl out, but she wouldn't come out.
Marcell broke the rear window with a rock, hoping to rescue her from the back. Then he saw that she was still strapped in by her shoulder belt. Marcell reached for the box cutter and cut the remaining strap in two. Kenny leaned in, grabbed Cheryl by the waist, and pulled her out feet first. Marcell grasped Cheryl's legs, and they managed to drag her lifeless body onto a rock.
""Give her CPR!"" Pamela yelled down to them. But the two men had no idea what to do. ""Put your mouth on her mouth and breathe,"" she shouted to Marcell. And to Kenny, ""Pump her chest!""
""We tried three times,"" said Marcell. Finally, Cheryl brought up water and started moving her fingers. The men rolled her over onto her stomach to let out more water.
Soon an ambulance arrived and transported Cheryl to the hospital, where doctors treated her. They never discovered what caused her to pass out, but she assumes it had something to do with the burning summer heat.
Over the next few days, they took turns visiting Cheryl in the hospital, where they shared hugs and tears. ""We couldn't believe she was all right,"" said Pamela.
""It's just amazing that these people came together,"" said Cheryl. She stays in touch with her ""angels"" via frequent phone calls. ""They are really beautiful people,"" she said.

Context: You can do it!
That's a better way to motivate   yourself than saying ""I can do it, "" according to a new study that shows giving yourself advice and encouragement in the second-person before an upcoming task may actually improve your performance more than first-person self-talk.
""People are used to receiving and giving advice in the second-person, and they seem to prefer using the second-person pronoun to encourage themselves,"" says study co-author, Dr. Sanda Dolcos, a researcher at the University of Illinois. ""Self-advice expressed using 'You' probably enables people to have a broader perspective , consider how others might view the event, and reproduce the kind of encouragements previously received from others.""
For the study, Dr. Dolcos and her colleague, Dr. Dolores, asked 143 undergraduate students to write down advice to themselves before completing a series of puzzles. Half of the students were asked to use the first-person, while the others wrote in the second-person.
What did the researchers find? The students who wrote in the second-person managed to complete more puzzles and appeared to have a more positive attitude.
The researchers also asked the students to write down advice to themselves in relation to exercising more often in the next two weeks. Those who wrote in the second-person, again, reported a more positive attitude toward the task and even planned to do more exercise than the students who referred to themselves in the first-person.
""We were not surprised and had previous research showing that people _ use 'You' in situations that require high levels of self-control and action,"" Dolcos said.
But why did the researchers ask students to write down their self-talk instead of saying it out loud? "" Writing as a tool of conversing with oneself has long been used as a therapeutical approach,"" Dolcos explained. ""However, further research is needed to determine which form of self-advice, written or spoken, is more beneficial."" 
 Question:What did the researchers find? 
A. Giving oneself advice and encouragement is very useful. 
B. It is more encouraging to talk to oneself using the second-person. 
C. First-person self-talk will not improve your performance. 
D. A good way to motivate yourself is saying ""I can do it"". 
 Answer: B
Context: Canadian experts have found that so - called self - help books may actually do more harm than good to people who really need help.Researchers say that individuals   with low respect felt much worse after repeating positive statements about themselves.
In their study, psychologists Joanne Wood and John Lee sought to determine how positive thinking affected people with different levels of self - confidence.They questioned dozens of people both made and female, analyzed their self - worth and optimism by means of the standard psychological methods and then asked them to write down their thoughts and feelings.The scoring system ranged from 0 to 35.
During the experiment, the researchers asked a total of 68 participants to repeat the self-help book phrase, ""I am a lovable person."" After that they measured the participants' moods and their feelings about themselves.The results revealed that the participants in the low self - respect group who repeated the mantra  , were feeling much worse afterwards, when compared to other participants in low self - respect group who did not repeat the phrase.Those with low self - respect who repeated the phrase scored an average of 10 points.Their counterparts   with equally low self - respect who were not asked to repeat the statement, were able to score a little higher average of 17 points.
However, individuals with high self - respect reported feeling better after repeating the positive self - statement - but only slightly.They scored an average of 31 points, compared with an average of 25 for those with equally high self - respect who did not repeat the phrase.
Professor Wood urged those who promote self - help books, magazines and television shows to stop telling people that simply repeating a positive mantra could change one's life.First, people start following this idea and feel like they are not alone.They are told that all they have to do is just to read that book and then to repeat these positive statements in a hope that things will be better, and when it does not work for them and they realize that nothing gets better, then it is really frustration to people.
Researchers concluded: ""Repeating positive self - statements may benefit certain people such as individuals with high self - respect but discourage the very people who need confidence the most."" 
 Question:So - called self - help books do some good to  _  . 
A. people lacking confidence 
B. people with high self - respect 
C. people with problems to settle urgently 
D. people repeating positive self - statements

Context: Miss Popular
I was awkward in middle school: bony and athletic, with a high grade in science and a low one in self-esteem. Though I had a few friends, I wasn't popular. I was picked last in football and I sometimes ate lunch by myself.
I remember the day Brittany came to our school. Her teeth were crooked , and she was a little overweight. Not that this mattered though, because she walked around like she was better than all of us. She was outspoken and incredibly frightening, making people lose confidence.
Around Brittany, I tried my best to go unnoticed. Standing out or stealing her spotlight could only result in one thing: conflict. Brittany was always the first girl picked for teams; I was lucky if I was picked at all. I was thrown the ball while she stood with the quarterback, chatting about the last party she'd gone to. I had never been to a party before or kissed a boy.
One day, a classmate asked me to the school dance. I was flattered. Then Brittany told me during science class that she had persuaded him to invite me. She asked in front of everyone, ""Why would anyone even want you?"" I went home and cried.
Although she was seemingly perfect in everyone's eyes, I wanted to be everything that she wasn't and yet a million times more perfect. Brittany was so frightening and violent, but I wanted to be calm and not at all aggressive.
I found Brittany's online profile a few weeks ago. She still had the same chubby  face and mocking simile, and had posted half-naked pictures of herself. But as I read on, I realized that Brittany had died in a drunken driving accident a year ago. She had been 16 and pregnant at the time. Suddenly my view of Brittany changed from a bad influence into a struggling little girl whose life was taken before she could understand right from wrong. My experience with Brittany taught me that though we are all innocent in our youth, the choices we make will have great effects on us forever. I will always remember Brittany as that loud, overconfident girl. As part of that shy insecure person I used to be will always keep me modest. 
 Question:The last passage is meant to  _  . 
A. tell us the reason for Brittany's death 
B. present the changed attitude to Brittany 
C. show the influences of the youth 
D. stress the importance of behaviors 
 Answer: B
Context: Mark Eklund was in the first third grade class I taught at Saint Mary's School in Morris, Minn. He was neat in appearance, but had that happy-to-be-alive attitude that made even his occasional mischievousness   delightful. Mark liked talking. I had to remind him again and again that talking without permission was not acceptable. What impressed me so much, though, was his sincere response every time I had to correct him for misbehaving: ""Thank you for correcting me, sister!""
One day in class, I asked pupils to list the names of the other students on two sheets of paper, leaving a space between each name. Then I told them to think of the nicest thing they could say about each of their classmates and write it down. That Saturday, I wrote down the name of each student on a separate sheet of paper, and I listed what everyone else had said about that student. On Monday I gave each student his or her list. Before long, the entire class was smiling.
    Several years later, after I returned from vacation, my father met me at the airport. 
    ""Mark was killed in the war,"" he said."" The funeral is tomorrow, and his parents would like it if you could attend.""
    I had never seen a serviceman in a military coffin   before. As I stood there, Mark's father said, ""We want to show you something. They found this on Mark when he was killed."" He took a wallet out of his pocket. 
    Opening the billfold  , he carefully removed two worn pieces of notebook paper that had obviously been taped, folded and refolded many times. I knew without looking that the papers were the ones on which I had listed all the good things each of Mark's classmates had said about him.
    ""Thank you so much for doing that,"" Mark's mother said. ""As you can see, Mark treasured it.""
    That's when I finally sat down and cried. I cried for Mark and for all his friends who would never see him again. 
 Question:What did the author ask the students to write on the paper? 
A. Mistakes each student had made. 
B. Things each student liked doing. 
C. The habits of each student. 
D. The strong point of each student

Context: Mr. and Mrs. Harris had always spent their summer holidays in a small hotel at the seaside near their hometown. One year, however, Mr.  Harris made a lot of money in his factory, so they decided to go to a foreign country and stay at a really good hotel.
They flew to Paris, and arrived at a 5-star hotel late in the evening. They thought they would have to go to bed hungry, because in that small hotel where they used to stay in the past, no meals were served after seven in the evening. They were surprised to be told that the hotel served dinner until ten.
""Then what are the times of meals?"" asked Mrs. Harris.
""Well, Madam, we serve breakfast from seven to eleven, lunch from twelve to three, tea from four to five, and dinner from six to ten.""
""But that hardly leaves any time for us to see the city!"" said Mrs. Harris. 
 Question:Why did Mr. and Mrs. Harris think they would have to go to bed hungry when they arrived at the hotel?

Context: In the UK, most children have their lunches at school, but in some schools, parents can choose what their children eat. The children can have a school dinner-a hot, cooked meal; or they can take a packed  lunch with them, which usually includes cold food like sandwiches.
Often parents know what their children want. Cath, a mother of three children, told us, ""My children have packed lunches because they say they don't like to have school dinners. So I make three packed lunches every morning.""
However, another mother, Susan, made a different choice. She said, ""My daughters have a always had school dinners. I think they probably get healthier food at school than a few sandwiches I make for them.""
But how healthy are school dinners? Kaz, a father, thought poorly of them. He said, ""Fizzy  drinks were offered and I think there were a lot of chips.""
Jamie Oliver spent a year working in a school kitchen. He was worried about the unhealthy food which included burgers, pizzas and chips. So he tried to cook healthy food such as good stews and curries for the children instead.
So Jamie improved the school dinners, and trained the dinner ladies to cook healthy food in that school. Then he advised the government to improve school food across the country. And it seems that the changes have begun.
Anna, a pupil, told us, ""We used to have a fast food window where you got chips and coke, but they stopped that this year. There's a salad restaurant, which is good, so it's healthier than it was.""

Context: As Amy Hagadorn rounded the corner across the hall from her classroom, she crashed with a tall boy from the fifth grade running in the opposite direction.
""Watch it, Squirt,"" the boy yelled, as he dodged around the little third grader. Then, with an unfriendly smile on his face, the boy took hold of his right leg and mimicked the way Amy limped when she walked.
Amy closed her eyes for a moment. --Ignore him, she told herself as she headed for her classroom.
But at the end of the day, Amy was still thinking about the tall boy's mean teasing. It wasn't as if he were the only one. Amy was tired of it. Sometimes, even in a classroom full of other students, the teasing about her speech or her limping made her feel all alone.
Back home at the dinner table that evening Amy was quiet. That's why Patti Hagdorn was happy to havesome exciting news to share with her daughter.
""There's a Christmas Wish Contest on the radio station,"" she announced. ""Write a letter to Santa and you might win a prize. I think someone at this table with blond curly hair should enter.""
Amy giggled. The contest sounded like fun. She started thinking about what she wanted most for Christmas.
A smile took hold of Amy when the idea first came to her. Out came pencil and paper and Amy went to work on her letter. --Dear Santa Claus, she began.
While Amy worked away at her best printing, the rest of the family tried to guess what she might ask from Santa. Amy's sister, Jamie, and Amy's mom both thought a 3-foot Barbie Doll would top Amy's wish list. Amy's dad guessed a picture book. But Amy wasn't ready to reveal her secret Christmas wish just then. Here is Amy's letter to Santa, just as she wrote it that night:
Dear Santa Clause,
My name is Amy. I am 9 years old. I have a problem at school. Can you help me, Santa? Kids laugh at me because of the way I walk and run and talk. I have cerebral palsy . I just want one day where no one laughs at me or makes fun of me.
Love,
Amy
At radio station WJLT in Fort Wayne, Indiana, letters poured in for the Christmas Wish Contest. The workers had fun reading about all the different presents that boys and girls from across the city wanted for Christmas.
When Amy's letter arrived at the radio station, manager Lee Tobin read it carefully. He knew cerebral palsy was a muscle disorder that might confuse the schoolmates of Amy who didn't understand her disability. He thought it would be good for the people in Fort Wayne to hear about this special third grader and her unusual wish. Mr. Tobin called up the local newspaper.
The next day, a picture of Amy and her letter to Santa made the front page of the News Sentinel. The story spread quickly. All across the country, newspapers and radio and television station reported the story of the little girl in Fort Wayne, Indiana, who asked for such a simple, yet remarkable Christmas gift - just one day without teasing.
Suddenly the postman was a regular at the Hagadorn house. Envelopes of all sizes addressed to Amy arrived daily from children and adults all across the nation. They came filled with holiday greetings and words of encouragement.
During that unforgettable Christmas season, over two thousand people from all over the world sent Amy letters of friendship and support. Amy and her family read every single one. Some of the writers had disabilities; some had been teased as children. Many people thanked Amy for being brave enough to speak up. Others encouraged her to ignore teasing and to carry her head high. Each writer had a special message for Amy. Through the cards and letters from strangers, Amy glimpsed a world full of people who truly cared about each other. She realized that no amount or form of teasing could ever make her feel lonely again.
Amy did get her wish of a special day without teasing at South Wayne Elementary School. Additionally, everyone at school got an added bonus. Teachers and students talked together about how bad teasing can make others feel.
That year, the Fort Wayne mayor officially proclaimed December 21st as Amy Jo Hagadorn Day throughout the city. The mayor explained that by daring to make such a simple wish, Amy taught a universal lesson.
""Everyone,"" said the mayor, ""wants and deserves to be treated with respect, dignity and warmth.""

Context: Some people have a very poor sense of direction. Unluckily, I am one of them. I have visited a place many times but I may still get lost there the next time.
When I was a little girl, I never dared to ask strangers the way. And so I used to walk around in circles and hope that by chance I would get to the place I was going to.
Now, I am no longer too shy to ask people for directions, but I often receive helpless or even wrong information. So I try to avoid giving people wrong directions. If anyone ever asks me the way somewhere, I would say, ""Sorry, I am a stranger here.""
Once on my way to work I was stopped by a man. He asked me if I could tell him the way to the Friendship Building. I gave him my usual reply. But just as I walked on only a few steps. I realized that he had asked the way to my office building. However, I had no time to turn back and look for him. I was rushing to meet with someone at my office and I didn't want to keep him waiting.
When I just got to my office, the secretary  showed in the man who had asked me for directions. Imagine how _ I was and how surprised he was when we saw each other at the first sight. 
 Question:The Friendship Building is the place where the writer   _  . 
A. lives 
B. studies 
C. works 
D. teaches

Context: He met her at the party. She was so outstanding, with many boys around her, while he was so normal, with nobody paying attention to him.
At the end of the party, he invited her to have coffee with him. She was surprised, but due to being polite, she agreed.
They sat in a nice coffee shop. He was too nervous to say anything, and she felt uncomfortable, thinking, ""Please let me go home.""
Suddenly he asked the waiter, ""Would you please give me some salt? I'd like to put it in my coffee.""
Everybody stared at him---so strange! His face turned red, but, still, he put the salt in his coffee and drank it.
She asked him curiously, ""Why do you have this hobby?""
He replied, ""When I was a little boy, I lived near the sea. I liked playing in the sea, and I could feel the taste of the sea, just like the taste of the salty coffee. Now every time I have the salty coffee, I always think of my childhood. I miss my hometown so much. I miss my parents who are still living there.""
While saying that, tears filled his eyes. She was deeply touched. That's his true feeling, from the bottom of his heart. A man who can tell about his homesickness must be a man who loves home, cares about home, and has a good sense of responsibility.
Then she also started to speak, about her faraway hometown, her childhood, her family. That was a really nice talk, also a beautiful beginning of their story.
They continued to date. She found that actually he was a man who meets all her demands: he was kind-hearted, warm and careful. He was such a good person but
!
Thanks to his salty coffee! Then the story was just like every beautiful love story, the princess married the prince, then they were living a happy life...And, every time she made coffee for him, she put some salt in the coffee.
After 40 years, he passed away, leaving her a letter which said, ""My dearest, please forgive my whole-life lie. This was the only lie I said to you ---the salty coffee.""
""Remember the first time we dated? I was so nervous at that time. Actually I wanted some sugar, but I said salt. It was hard for me to change so I just went ahead.""
""I tried to tell you the truth many times in my life, but I was too afraid to do that, as I have promised not to lie to you for anything.""
""Now I'm dying, I'm afraid of nothing so I tell you the truth: I don't like the salty coffee. What a strange and bad taste! But I have had the salty coffee for my whole life!""
""Since I knew you, I never feel sorry for anything I do for you. Having you with me is my biggest happiness for my whole life. If I can live for a second time, I still want to know you and have you for my whole life, even though I have to drink the salty coffee again.""
Her tears made the letter totally wet.
Someday, someone asked her, ""What's the taste of salty coffee?"" ""It's sweet,"" she replied. 
 Question:It is implied in the passage that the woman    _    when reading the letter left by her husband. 
A. was confused about his behavior 
B. was touched by his white lie 
C. felt sorry to know the truth too late

Context: One evening I was on my daily evening return from London to my home. I had got into the habit of sitting in the last carriage at the platform, so I could get off near to the station exit at my end. One evening before getting off the train, I found a purse. I opened the purse and thought this must be my lucky day, for the purse contained some PS80 in cash. Looking further into the purse, I found credit cards, and house keys and a name and address. My first thought when seeing the cash was to pocket it, and throw the other contents away.
Now I am not a basically dishonest person, but had developed a hardened attitude over the years that most people were dishonest in some way, and my own personal experience had been that whenever I lost anything of value, that was the last I ever saw of it. And since I was a construction worker at that time, I had been the victim of a great deal of stealing during my working life.
Almost as I read the name and address, I had a picture of that woman being struck with terror, when she realized she had lost her purse, and could not get into her home, had no money, and, would have thoughts of someone spending on her credit cards, not to mention the trouble of canceling all the cards.
In that same moment I decided to hand the purse over  to the train guard. So I told him I would like to see it returned to its rightful owner. He told me would be sent to the lost property office. I arrived at my station and started to walk the five minute journey to my home all the while feeling very pleased with myself that I was going to bring a great deal of happiness to someone I did not know. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? 
A. The owner of the purse is one friend of the author's. 
B. The author often did some stealing during his work time in the past. 
C. The author's feeling guilty at heart urged him to return the purse.

Context: A ten-year-old boy from Howell, Michigan America is being hailed (...) a hero due to his persistence   that led to saving the life of an elderly neighbor. The chain of events unfolded late in the evening on Sunday, January 26th, 2014 when Danny Dipietro was being driven home from hockey practice by his dad.
That's when the young boy noticed an open garage and a figure that he believed was a dog outside an apartment near his house. Given the extremely cold weather, the young boy got a feeling that something was not right. But instead of dismissing   it like most kids at his age would have, he insisted that his mother, Dawn, go to examine what was going on. Dawn tried to convince   Danny that no one would leave a dog out in such cold weather, but he refused to take no for an answer.
Dawn finally gave in and decided to take a walk to the area with the family dog and see if there was any truth to Danny's premonition  . Sure enough, as she got closer to the apartment she noticed a garage that was wide open and a bent figure, waving madly. Upon getting there, she realized that it was not a dog that the young boy had seen, but Kathleen St. Onge, one of her neighbors. The 80-year-old had slipped on some ice in her garage and had been lying there for two hours, unable to get up.
Dawn rushed home to get her husband for help and called 911. The two then returned with some blankets to cover Ms. St. Onge, while they waited for the ambulance to arrive. Though still in hospital, the elderly woman is recovering well and grateful to Danny for his premonition. 
 Question:When Danny Dipietro's mother found the elderly woman, the elderly woman   _  . 
A. had lain in the garage for two hours 
B. was trapped in her garage with her dog 
C. was looking for her dog around the garage

Context: When I was six, dad brought home a dog one day, who was called ""Brownie"". My brothers and I all loved Brownie and did different things with her. One of us would walk her, another would feed her, then there were baths, playing catch and many other games. Brownie, in return, loved each other and every one of us. One thing that most touched my heart was that she would go to whoever was sick and just be with them. We always felt better when she was around.
One day , as I was getting her food, she chewed up one of dad's shoes, which had to be thrown away in the end. I knew dad would be mad and I had to let her know what she did was wrong. When I looked at her and said, ""Bad girl,"" she looked down at the ground and then went and hid. I saw a tear in her eyes.
Brownie turned out to be more than just our family pet. She went everywhere with us. People would stop and ask if they could pet her. Of course she'd let anyone pet her. She was just the most lovable dog. There were many times when we'd be out walking and a small child would come over and pull on her hair. She never barked or tried to get away. Funny thing is she would smile. This frightened people because they thought she was showing her teeth. Far from the truth, she loved everyone. 
 Question:Which of the following best describes Brownie? 
A. Shy 
B. Polite 
C. Brave 
D. Caring

Context: It seems that some people go out of their way to get into trouble. That's more or less what happened the night that Nashville Police Officer Floyd Hyde was on duty.
""I was on the way to a personal-injury accident in West Nashville. As I got onto Highway 40, blue lights and sirens   going, I fell in behind a gold Pontiac Firebird that suddenly seemed to take off quickly down the highway. The driver somehow panicked at the sight of me. He was going more than a hundred miles an hour and began passing cars on the shoulder. ""
But Hyde couldn't go after him. Taking care of injured people is always more important than worrying about speeders, so the officer had to stay on his way to the accident. But he did try to keep the Firebird in sight as he drove, hoping another nearby unit would be able to step in and stop the speeding car. As it turned out, keeping the Firebird in sight was not that difficult. Every turn the Pontiac made was the very turn the officer needed to get to the accident scene.
Hyde followed the Pontiac all the way to his destination. At that point he found another unit had already arrived at the accident scene. His help wasn't needed. Now he was free to try to stop the driver of the Firebird, who by this time had developed something new to panic about.
""Just about that time,"" Hyde says, ""I saw fire coming out from under that car, with blue smoke and oil going everywhere. He'd blown his engine. Now he had to stop. ""
""After I arrested him, I asked him why he was running. He told me he didn't have a driver's license.""
That accident cost the driver of the Firebird plenty -- a thousand dollars for the new engine -- not to mention the charges for driving without a license, attempting to run away, and dangerous driving. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is true? 
A. Someone else was taking care of the injured person. 
B. The Pontiac reached its destination at the accident scene. 
C. Hyde knew where he was going by following the right car. 
D. The policeman was running after a speeder on Highway 40.

Context: John once told me a story about his friend, Michael. Michael happened to be on a train sitting next to a young man who seemed worried. Finally the young man told the friend that he was a convict   returning home from a prison far away. What he did had brought shame   on his family, and they had neither visited him nor written to him. He hoped, however, that this was only because they were too poor to travel and too busy to write.

Context: Father was a hardworking man who delivered bread as a living to support his wife and three children. He spent all his evenings after work attending classes, hoping to improve himself so that he could one day find a better paid job. Except for Sundays, Father hardly ate a meal together with his family. He worked and studied very hard because he wanted to provide his family with the best that money could buy. 
   Whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else. 
   The day came when the examination results were announced. To his joy, Father passed, and with distinctions too! Soon after, he was offered a good job as a senior supervisor which paid handsomely.
   Like a dream come true, Father could now afford to provide his family with life's little luxuries like nice clothing, fine food and vacation abroad.
   However, the family still did not get to see Father for most of the week. He continued to work very hard, hoping to be promoted to the position of manager. In fact, to make himself a worthily candidate for the promotion, he took another course in an open university.
   Again, whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else.
   Father's hard work paid off and he was promoted. Happily, he decided to hire a maid to relieve his wife from her domestic tasks. He also felt that their three-room flat was no longer big enough. It would be nice for his family to be able to enjoy the facilities and comfort of a condominium.    Having experienced the rewards of his hard work many times before, Father resolved to further his studies and work at being promoted again. The family still did not get to see much of him. In fact, sometimes Father had to work on Sundays entertaining clients.
   Over again, whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else.
   As expected, Father's hard work paid off again and he bought a beautiful condominium overlooking the coast of Singapore. On the first Sunday evening at their new home, Father declared to his family that he decided not to take any more courses or pursue any more promotions. From then on he was going to devote more time to his family, and it was a promise. 
   Father did not wake up the next day.

Context: Change Has Come to America
November, 04, 2008, Barack Obama
Hello, Chicago.
If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.
It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen.
A little bit earlier this evening, I received an extraordinarily gracious call from Sen. McCain. Sen. McCain fought long and hard in this campaign. And he's fought even longer and harder for the country that he loves. He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine. We are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader.
I congratulate him; I congratulate Gov. Palin for all that they've achieved. And I look forward to working with them to renew this nation's promise in the months ahead.
I want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart, and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on the train home to Delaware, the vice president-elect of the United States, Joe Biden.
And I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last 16 years the rock of our family, the love of my life, the nation's next first lady Michelle Obama.
Sasha and Malia I love you both more than you can imagine. And you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the new White House.
To my sister Maya, my sister Alma, all my other brothers and sisters, thank you so much for all the support that you've given me. I am grateful to them.
And to my campaign manager, David Plouffe, the unsung hero of this campaign, who built the best -- the best political campaign, I think, in the history of the United States of America.
To my chief strategist David Axelrod who's been a partner with me every step of the way.
To the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics you made this happen, and I am forever grateful for what you've sacrificed to get it done.
But above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to. It belongs to you. It belongs to you. 
 Question:Why did Sen. McCain make a phone call to the writer? 
A. To inform the writer of something important. 
B. To share his happiness with the writer. 
C. To congratulate the writer on his success. 
D. To give him some good ideas on making a successful speech..

Context: We're trying to decide where to go on our vacation this summer.  We usually go to Lake Arrowheads for a few weeks, but we'd like to go somewhere else this year. We're tired of doing the same thing summer after summer. Some friends of ours suggested us go to Hawaii. That would be wonderful. I' m sure we would enjoy a trip like that, but of course it's impossible. First, it would be rather expensive, and second, there would not be enough time. If we're lucky enough to save some money between now and next summer, and if I'm lucky enough to get four weeks of vacation instead of two weeks, maybe we can go to Hawaii next year. In fact, if we wanted to plan a trip like that, it would be good to stay home and not to go to any place. That's one way we could begin to save some money for next year's trip. Also, if we were to stay here, I would like to work instead of taking two weeks off: then maybe my boss would suggest that I should be given four weeks' vacation instead of two weeks. 
 Question:If they had decided to go to Hawaii this summer, the writer  _ 
A. would go there , too 
B. would go to Lake Arrowhead 
C. would stay home or work 
D. would stop them going there. 
 Answer: C
Context: Dear Frank,
Thank you for your email. I'm very glad you are having a good trip now. Ottawa is very beautiful in May. I hope I can have a chance  to go there one day. Our summer holiday will start next month.

And I am going to our hometown near Chicago with my sister, Linda, and my parents agree .Our uncle lives there, so Linda and I can stay with him. We are not going to take a plane. We are going there by train. I am going to fish there. And Linda likes painting. She is going to do some painting there. I'm sure we'll have a good time.
Sincerely,
Jack

Our ability will no longer be judged only by knowledge gained in the past, but will also be measured by our ability to learn and adapt in the future.
Learning isn't just about economic success, however. It is the key to achieving our full potential(,). Human beings are particularly adapted to learn and we have the ability to do so throughout our lives.
Learning has the power to change us. Specifically, we can become more successful. Learning can enable us to solve problems and change our attitudes. It makes us more interesting to be with. It can be enormous fun. It can also be very challenging.
We all have the ability, at any age, to change our lives through learning. Our survival in the twenty-first century as individuals, organizations and nations, will depend on our ability to learn. A learning population is healthier, more tolerant(,), independent and fulfilled. Learning can take place in a range of styles: anytime, anywhere, anyhow.
None of us learn in isolation(,). There are a whole range of factors that can affect us in learning. The key factors affecting people's learning include: *their resources *their image of learning *the rewards associated with any learning activity *the availability of information about learning opportunities *the climate created by government and employers in which learning takes place 
 Question:What is the most important skill in the next century according to the passage? 
A. Knowledge we obtained in the past. 
B. Computer skill. 
C. The ability to obtain and apply knowledge.

Context: I went through a training program and became a literacy volunteer last surnmen The training
I received, though excellent, did not tell me how it was to work with a real student, however. When I began to discover what other people's lives were like because they could not read, I realized the true importance of reading.
My first student Marie was a 44-year-old single mother of three. In the first lesson, I found out she walked two miles to the nearest supermarket twice a week because she didn't know which bus to take. When I told her I would get her a bus schedule, she told me it would not help because she could not  read it. She said she also had difficulty once she got to the supermarket,because she couldn't always remember what she needed. Since she did not know words, she could not write out a shopping list. Also, she could only recognize items by sight, so if the product had a different label, she would not recognize it as the product she wanted.
As we worked together, learning how to read built Marie's self-confidence,which encouraged her to continue her studies. She began to make rapid progress and was even able to take the bus to the supermarketelt. After this successful trip, she reported how self-confident she felt. At the end of the program, she began helping her youngest son,Tony, a shy first grader with his reading. She sat with him before he went to sleep and together they would read bedtime stories. When his eyes became wide with excitement as she read, pride was written all over her face. As she described this experience, I was proud of myself as well. I found that helping Marie to build her self-confidence was more rewarding than anything I had ever done before.
As a literacy volunteer, I learned a great deal about teaching and helping others. In fact, I may have learned more from the experience than Marie did. 
 Question:How did Marie use to find the goods she wanted in the supermarket? 
A. She knew where the goods were in the supermarket 
B. She asked others to take her to the right place 
C. She managed to find the goods by their looks 
D. She remembered the names of the goods

Context: My friend Alice decided to be a nurse when she was four years old. She always to play at ""doctors and nurses"" with her playmates. When she left school last year, she still wanted to be a real nurse. 
Late September she started her studies in a big hospital in Newcastle. She had to work very hard. She went to classes every day and studied late at night. Then a really important day came: her first day in a ward  . At last she was really helping sick people, not just sitting in classes or learning from books. 
At first, student nurses do lots of odd jobs in the ward. They help to serve meals, or wash the patients. They also keep the ward tidy and make the beds. But they cannot give injections or help the doctors. 
One of Alice's first jobs was in a ward of old people. She was told to clean all the patients' false teeth. She collected all the teeth and took them to the bathroom. Instead of cleaning each set of teeth one by one, she put them all into a big bowl. 
""It'll be quicker this way,"" she said to herself. ""Then I can give back everyone's teeth in a few minutes."" 
Give back everyone's teeth! Alice stood in the middle of the ward with her big bowl of teeth. She had no idea which teeth belonged to which old man! You can imagine the confusion  of the next half-hour when each patient came to find his own teeth! 
 Question:One day Alice was told   _   in the ward of old people. 
A. to serve meals 
B. to clean the patients' false teeth 
C. to wash the patients 
D. to keep the ward tidy 
 Answer: B
Context: Recently I fully understood that a little favor could really make a big difference. My daughter and I were, accidentally, in time to catch a falling heart just before it hit the ground.
It all started when Charlene, one of my co-volunteers at the library, asked if I could do her duty on Tuesday since her doctor appointment had been unexpectedly changed. I agreed, which meant I  was home on Friday instead of volunteering as previously planned.
My daughter, Mary, managers a book store in town. Mid-morning, she called to ask me for help. Would I buy a fifty dollar gift card, birthday card, and cake for one of Mary's assistant managers, Cindy?
Mary explained she had to call Cindy in to take the place of another assistant manager who was sick, but felt terrible about it when she discovered it was Cindy's birthday. Cindy insisted that it was just fine. But that was not what Mary thought, so she gathered enough money from other employees to throw a surprise party for Cindy. Since neither Mary, nor any of the other employees, could leave to pick up the _ , they were turning to me for help. Days later, Mary told me the wonderful rest of the story, ""Cindy cried and cried when we surprised her. After the party, Cindy told us that her boyfriend had chosen that morning to break up with her. To top that off, she only had 26 cents left in her bank account.""
We were surprised at the series of unexpected events that took place in order to circle Cindy with love and catch her falling heart just before it hit the ground. 
 Question:What can we learn about Mary? 
A. Shewasalearned careerwoman. 
B. Shehaduneasyrelationshipswithherassistants. 
C. SheknewCindy'slovestorybeforethesurpriseparty. 
D. Sheplayedthemostimportantroleinthiscircleoflove.

Context: I was eleven years old, waiting for my exam at Saraswati Vidyalaya, my school in Nagpur. ""No. 12, please come forward."" Kirti, a very fat girl from my class, stepped ahead. I heard my classmates laughing and so I tried to stop them with my eyes. But my good intentions were mistaken. The next morning, my teacher, Mrs. Kamble, told me, ""Ashwini, I've received a complaint about you."" I was shocked. The girl I was protecting thought I'd been laughing at her.
I tried to explain but the teacher refused to hear me out. She punished me by making me stand by the door. I knew I was right. Such punishment to a class topper was simply unheard of. But, slowly, my pride disappeared. Instead of being angry, I understood the other students who have been punished at times. For the first time, I felt humbled  .
Three years later, I was in the math class. Mr. Prabhuraman, wrote an equation   -- one he'd taught us the day before -- on the blackboard. ""Anyone who doesn't know how to solve this,"" he said, ""please leave the class at once."" I knew I could solve only the first two steps. But my pride made me stay there. Unfortunately, the one who was asked to solve it was me. I just stood there, chalk in hand, trying not to look foolish. I prepared myself for a good talking-to  , but Mr. Prabhuraman told me kindly, ""Go back to your seat.""
Today, two decades later, those incidents have made me think. One teacher punished me for something I didn't do; the other forgave me for something I did wrong. Both experiences had an effect on me. They remind me that no matter what you accomplish  , you must always be humble. 
 Question:When the very fat girl appeared, Ashwini   _  . 
A. took no notice of her 
B. laughed at her 
C. said hello to her 
D. tried to stop others making fun of her

Context: When I was at university,  I studied very hard. But a lot of my friends did very little work. Some did just enough to pass exams. Others didn't do quite enough. Fred Baines was one of them.

Context: Mr. Smith is well known in Washington because of his many social blunders. He always likes to attend the various social functions because he wants to expand his circle of friends. Whenever he is invited, he goes, unless he is ill.
Recently he received an invitation to a fashionable banquet. Although he did not know the hostess, he accepted the invitation. He was secretly very pleased, because he felt that his reputation as a desirable guest was growing.

""It hardly matters whether you like the Secretary or not,"" she said. ""He was chosen because the President thought he was the man for the job. If he does the job well, you should have no complaint.""
""That's just it,"" persisted Mr. Smith. ""No one does the things he does, unless he is a complete fool!""
""Sir!"" said the woman in all her dignity. ""Do you know who I am?"" ""No,"" replied Mr. Smith.
""I am the Secretary's wife,"" she said coldly. Mr. Smith was shocked, but he went on in spite of his embarrassment. ""Madam, do you know who I am?""

Context: One evening last fall, while Marcos Ugarte did his homework and his father, Eduardo, a teacher, prepared lesson plans, they heard shouting outside. Eduardo, 47, and Marcos, 15, stepped onto the balcony  of their two-story home. Immediately, Marcos' s eye was caught by a flame from one of their neighbors' houses.
""Dad, the house is on fire!"" Marcos cried. Dressed only in shorts, the barefoot teen
dashed towards the Mas' home with his dad. Grandmother Yim Ma, mother Suzanne Ma, and son Nathan Ma were gathered on the front grassland shouting for help. When the Ugartes got there, they saw through the open front door that father Alex Ma was falling down the stairs, coughing, his face black with dirt.
""Is anyone else in the house?"" Eduardo asked.
""My son!"" Alex managed to say, pointing to the second floor.
Eduardo started up the stairs, but thick, black smoke, swirling ash, and extreme heatforced him to his knees. He inched upstairs and down the hall where Alex said he would find Cody, eight, who had locked himself in a bedroom. ""I'd never seen smoke like that,"" says Eduardo. ""My glasses immediately turned black from the ash.""
As the fire spread across the hall, Eduardo banged on the bedroom door and tried to turn the handle. But Cody didn't respond, and Eduardo made his way back downstairs. At the same time, Marcos saw Yim and Suzanne pulling an aluminum  ladder out of the garage. ""Cody was standing at the window, screaming for help,"" says Marcos.
""I knew I had to do something."" He grabbed the ladder, positioned it near the window, and climbed towards the boy. When Marcos reached the window, he pushed the screen into the room and persuaded Cody out. ""It's OK,"" Marcos told him. ""I've got you."" Holding Cody with one arm, Marcos moved down the ladder. Halfway down, he handed the boy to a neighbor.
The day after the fire, Alex visited Marcos. ""Thank you for saving my son,"" Alex said. ""You are his hero forever.""

Context: Stacey Hillman, who is 10 years old, was reading a magazine about police dogs needing bulletproof vests  . She thought that someone should start raising money for the police dogs.
After she got permission from Chief LaBrusciano, she went to the County Sheriff Don Eslinger. She got busy visiting all the police dogs and telling the departments about her new charity. She made ""collection boxes"" by using bottles and put a picture of her with a police dog on it. She put these bottles in vet's offices and pet stores.
The Chief from her hometown police department helped make Stacey's idea an official charity -- Pennies to Protect Police Dogs. The more money she collected, the more popular she became, and the more people offered to donate and help her with her goal   of giving every police dog effective protection. 
Stacey travels all around her state to raise money and tell people how important the police dogs are. She speaks at schools, and they donate to her charity, too. Since Stacey started her charity, she has bought bulletproof vests for the police dogs with all the 140 thousand dollars she has raised. But she has many more K-9 friends that still need to be protected and she promises to keep doing her charity until every police dog in the whole country has a bulletproof vest.
Each vest costs $700, and every police dog should have one. There are not always tax dollars to provide K-9s with these vests, and very few departments have them. The police dogs save lives just like police officers do, and often the police dogs are the first to go in. Stacey depends on donations from everyone to provide the dogs with bulletproof vests. 
 Question:How many bulletproof vests has Stacey bought for the police dogs? 
A. 100. 
B. 140. 
C. 200. 
D. 700.

While Shiny's great grandfather went to sleep during the race, Smily's great grandfather won the race by slowly walking towards the finish line.
Smily said, ""If your great grandfather didn't go to sleep, my great granddad might never win. So his win was not a real win.""
The next day there was a notice in the jungle  newspaper. It said that there would be a race and the winner would win many prizes. The race started from the bear's house. From there, the runners had to cross the river. But most of the animals could not both run fast and swim fast. So they didn't know what to do. Shiny and Smily made a plan.

Context: Once a 10-year-old boy decided to learn judo   though he had lost his left arm in a car accident.
The boy began lessons with an old Japanese sensei, a judo teacher. Three months later, he was still practising with the same move. So he asked, ""Sensei, shouldn't I be learning more moves?""
""This is the only move you know, but this is the only move you'll ever need to know,"" the sensei replied.
The boy kept training. Months later, the sensei took him to his first match.
Surprisingly, the boy easily won his first two matches. The third match was more difficult, but after some time, his opponent   became impatient. The boy used his one move to win the match and now was in the final.
This time, his opponent was bigger, stronger, and more experienced. For a while, the boy seemed to lose the game. Being worried that the boy might get hurt, the referee   called a break. Just before the referee wanted to end the match, the sensei came to him.
""No,"" the sensei said, ""let him go on."" Soon after the match began, his opponent made a big mistake: he dropped his guard  . Suddenly, the boy won the match.
On the way home, the boy and the sensei talked about every move in each match. Then the boy gathered the courage to ask, ""Sensei, how did I win the match with only one move?""
""You won for two reasons,"" the sensei answered. ""First, you've learned one of the most difficult throws in all of judo. Second, the only known guard for that move is for your opponent to catch your left arm.""

Context: Ellen and Bill County are both teachers. They met in college and became good friends because of their shared love for children. Two years after the couple got married, Ellen saw a huge change in the life of one of her students, a 9 - year - old girl. Three years earlier both of the little girl's parents had died and there was no one to take care of her. She was taken away to live in a government office. But finally she was taken in and adopted by a family and became their daughter. Ellen said that she noticed the difference in the child's life after she was placed in a permanent home and thought that maybe she and her husband could help a child in a similar way.
They decided to become temporary parents and to take a child into their home just on the weekends when the real parents could not take care of him or her. The pair planned to have their own children in a few years, but decided that this would be a way to give to the community in the meantime.
The couple quickly grew to love one of the children they looked after. When he became legally available, Billy became the first child they took in permanently. Six months after adopting Billy, Ellen was told by her doctor that she was unable to have children naturally. Ellen says she knew then that adoption was the way she was meant to have a family.
Since adopting Billy, now 17, Ellen and Bill have adopted five more children -- Rose, 16; Albert, 11; Joshua, 5 and in June 2003, they added biological brother and sister Tyler and Rylee to the County family. The County family has been recognized for their work on adoption, and has received many awards for their efforts.  Last June,  the family was even interviewed on  the television show, ""Adoption Stories"".
Ellen says she would like to encourage other families to adopt children. She adds that the best part of being a mother of six is: ""Giving Josh a bath, putting a band-aid on a cut knee or just the everyday Mom things, that makes motherhood such an honor and a privilege."" 
 Question:Why did Ellen and Bill first decide to adopt a child? 
A. Because they had always loved students very much. 
B. Because they saw the benefits of adoption for a child. 
C. Because they were not able to have children of their own.

Context: Stepfamilies are commonplace in the United States and their number continues to grow.While stepfamilies differ widely in their make-up, they all consist of a parenting couple and children, one or more of whom is of a previous union.Such combinations of his kids, her kids, and then, possibly, kids of the new union make for complicated and often trying difficulties, more challenging than those of traditional families.
Since stepfamilies involve more people and, consequently, more potential problems from the start than do childless new marriage, it is wise for the couple to do some careful planning prior to (=before) marriage.Not only do the prospective  marital partners need agreement about their own carriers, life goals, finance and special interests, they must also prepare for new relationship with their children and attempt to accommodate their individual needs and feelings.Furthermore, there are often the rights of other relatives to consider.
As for any family, the basic ingredient  of a successful stepfamily are affection, kindness and mutual  respect.However, love alone is not enough.Certainly love is the cornerstone upon which the foundation of any family is built, but there are also many other important ingredients involved in building a successful stepfamily.
Surveys reveal that successful families regard the ability to communicate openly as the most important factor in their success.Communication is what keeps families on track and functioning as a unit.Although healthy communication is easier for some people than for others, this skill can be learned and improved.Healthy communication involves speaking clearly and listening carefully.
By their very nature, stepfamilies often are complicated by past events that give rise to ambivalent  loyalties, lingering  hurts, fears,feelings of guilt and unrealistic dreams.The difficulties that arise within the stepfamilies are human and understandable.However, there are ways to confront  and resolve them.For example, support groups and professional counselors  are available in most communities to provide help and guidance when communications stopped and problems seem overwhelming .
Planning and building a stepfamily is not a responsibility to take lightly.It can be a very trying and, at times, seemingly impossible effort.Many potential troubles can arise and threaten to destroy the stepfamily.Nevertheless, meeting and mastering these special challenges can bring unexpected satisfactions and rewarding depths of family closeness and affection. 
 Question:It is natural for a stepfamily to be     . 
A. unrealistic 
B. complicated 
C. ambivalent 
D. guilty

Context: Our listener question this week comes from Abdullahi Farah, who wants to know about the life and work of Doctor Benjamin Carson.
Doctor Carson is an internationally recognized doctor at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. He has been the director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at the hospital for twenty-five years. At the age of thirty-three, he became one of the youngest doctors in the United States to hold that position. And he was the first African-American to have that position at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
Ben Carson is known for his work as a brain surgeon for children. For example, in nineteen eighty-seven, he led a team of seventy doctors and nurses in an operation to separate two babies joined at the head. Earlier attempts by other
on other babies had failed. Doctor Carson successfully performed the operation. Both babies were able to survive independently.
Doctor Carson has written four books. His first book, ""Gifted Hands,"" tells the story of his life. Benjamin Carson was born in nineteen fifty-one in Detroit, Michigan.
As a boy, Ben was not a good student. In fact, he was the worst in his class. When his mother learned of his failing grades she asked her sons to read two library books every week. She limited the amount of time they watched television. And she told them to respect every person.
Ben Carson soon became the top student in his class. He went on to study at Yale University, one of the best universities in the country, and later to medical school at the University of Michigan.
Doctor Carson has received many awards and honors. Last year he received the nation's highest civilian honor. Former President George W. Bush presented Benjamin Carson with the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a ceremony at the White House.

Context: To the Editor,
Re Why a Fallen Angel Is a Centerfold (Sunday Review, Nov. 6): I first met Lindsay Lohan in 1997 when she was 11 and I was the casting director   of the film The Parent Trap.  I was struck by her talent, fresh charm and innocence the moment I caught sight of her. She was, and remains, a gifted actress and a good human being.
It is not for me to judge Ms Lohan's choices, or whether fame has been less than kind to her, but I have been greatly saddened by the way the media have chosen, with all gloves off and seemingly going with what could please them, to record her efforts and failures.  She is a sentient   human being, not a thing, not a product, not anything else to be sold.
Charles McGrath makes several attractive points in his news analysis about the public demand which is impossible to satisfy, in a 24/7 news cycle forever changed by the Internet, to gossip about, and give nearly complete access to, celebrity or famous persons' lives. Perhaps people do feel better knowing that wealth and fame do not lead to a perfect life for everyone.  Perhaps we admire famous people only to reject them without any pity or mercy when their behavior disappoints us.
I find it ironic   that Ms Lohan's decision to pose for Playboy for a monetary reward is considered to be morally questionable, while journalists and photographers gain profit by writing about and capturing images of her and other famous people.
Perhaps when reporting on and reading about famous people who have lost their way, we will remember that those people are also very human people who, like us, make mistakes, endure misfortune and have a chance--in spite of media coverage--to begin a completely new life tomorrow.

Context: When Taylor Swift first came to the attention of the public,she was a 17yearold newcomer who loved singing to her guitar.She seemed far more enthusiastic than skillful.
Four years later,Swift became a multiaward winner.This month,she was crowned ""Woman of the Year"" by Billboard magazine,the youngest singersongwriter ever to receive the honor.""Aged only 21,Taylor has already made a maior impact on music and has been an unbelievable role model for hopeful artists and young women everywhere,"" said Bill Werde,Billboard's director.

Songwriting,as Swift explains,is to cope with issues.""I tend to write about things that really impact me most."" There certainly seems to be something true and honest running through every one of the 14 songs on her album,Speak Now,about ""the lessons and confusion and heartbreak and all the different things that go along with being 18,19 and 20.""
""For the audience too young to have experienced real passion or heartbreak,Swift's songs are like a potential road map,promising things will work out OK,"" commented Dorian ynskey in a British newspaper.
Now Swift is getting ready to go further and has so far written about 10 songs for her 2012 album,which is about feelings of growing up and becoming an adult.""They're sad,if I'm being honest.""""They're about my heartbreaks and my moving on.But more importantly,they are about achieving contentment.You're not always going to be perfectly happy as you grow up.""

Context: The statistics I've cited and the living examples are all too familiar to you. But what may not be so familiar will be the increasing number of women who are looking actively for advancement of for a new job in your offices. This woman may be equipped with professional skills and perhaps valuable experience. She will not be content to be Executive Assistant to Mr. Seldom Seen of the Assistant Vice President's Girl Friday, who is the only one who comes in on Saturday.
She is the symbol of what I call the Second Wave of Feminism. She is the modern woman who is determined to be.
Her forerunner was the radical feminist who interpreted her trapped position as a female as oppression by the master class of men. Men, she believed, had created a domestic, servile role for women in order that men could have the career and the opportunity to participate in making the great decisions of society. Thus the radical feminist held that women through history had been oppressed and dehumanized, mainly because man chose to exploit his wife and the mother of his children. Sometimes it was deliberate exploitation and sometimes it was the innocence of never looking beneath the pretensions of life.
The radical feminists found strength in banding together. Coming to recognize each other for the first time, they could explore their own identities, realize their own power, and view the male and his system as the common enemy. The first phases of feminism in the last five years often took on this militant, class-warfare tone. Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, Germaine Greer, and many others hammered home their ideas with a persistence that aroused and intrigued many of the brightest and most able women in the country. Consciousness-raising groups allowed women to explore both their identities and their dreams--and the two were often found in direct conflict.
What is the stereotyped role of American women? Marriage. A son. Two daughters. Breakfast. Ironing. Lunch. Bowling, maybe a garden club of for the very daring, non-credit courses in ceramics. Perhaps an occasional cocktail party. Dinner. Football or baseball on TV. Each day the same. Never any growth in expectations--unless it is growth because the husband has succeeded. The inevitable question: ""Is that all there is to life?""
The rapid growth of many feminist organizations attests to the fact that these radical feminists had touched some vital nerves. The magazine ""Ms."" was born in the year of the death of the magazine ""Life."" But too often the consciousness-raising sessions became ends in themselves. Too often sexism reversed itself and man-hating was encouraged. Many had been with the male chauvinist.
It is not difficult, therefore, to detect a trend toward moderation. Consciousness-raising increasingly is regarded as a means to independence and fulfillment, rather than a ceremony of fulfillment itself. Genuine independence can be realized through competence, through finding a career, through the use of education. Remember that for many decades the education of women was not supposed to be useful.

Context: After I made it to the city center, I started to feel it might be easy for a foreigner to deal with the great size of Beijing. With growing confidence, I decided to take the subway to the hotel, not realizing that the network didn't go that far. Impressed with the cleanliness of the station, I bought a ticket and boarded the first train that came along.
After a few minutes I asked in English of course a young man seated next to me where I should get off closest to the Friendship Hotel. Wearing a smart business suit and tie, he would surely speak English, wouldn't he? Unfortunately, he couldn't understand me but seemed very friendly. I showed him the room card with all the information of the Friendship Hotel in Chinese characters. He looked at it, and then his eyes moved quickly to the carriage   subway map. Next, he raised three fingers of his right hand.
In Australia, raising fingers at someone is not usually nice, but this man wasn't smiling. At the next station he showed me two fingers. Now in   Australia, that's really rude, but I got the message. When we stopped at the third station, he didn't just point to the door, but got up, took me out of the train, and led me to the top of the stairs, and out onto the street. Then he stopped a taxi and told the driver where to take me.
All this came from a man who couldn't speak my language, and I couldn't speak his. I was now speechless, especially when he refused my offer of money. I felt a little embarrassed having even thought he would accept a tip.
This experience made it clear I had to learn some Chinese quickly or my adventures might start turning into bad luck.

Context: COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A group of black parents and civil rights activists presented a petition  Thursday calling for officials to drop charges against a 16-year-old South Carolina high school student who was videotaped being dragged from her desk and thrown to the floor by a police officer in her classroom.
The group said it was unfair and unacceptable that the student and her 18-year-old classmate at Spring Valley High School who taped the incident were the only people charged that day when authorities already knew Richland County Deputy Ben Fields had tossed the girl from her desk to the ground.
They also said their petition had hundreds of thousands of names from around the country asking prosecutor Dan Johnson to drop the ""disturbing schools"" charges against the teens. The students in the case are black; Fields is white.
Johnson issued a statement Wednesday saying he won't do anything with the case until the FBI finishes its investigation into Fields, who was fired after the video became public. ""I do not simply decide cases based upon feelings, public opinion or sentiment, nor do I decide them based on political pressure,"" Johnson said in the statement.
Disturbing schools is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or 90 days in jail. The students' lawyer did not respond to telephone messages.
The video spread quickly across the country, prompting questions about when police officers should get involved with classroom discipline. Fields was called to the classroom after the student refused to stop using her cellphone, and then she would not leave the classroom for a teacher or administrator.
In the days after the incident, the teacher turned her class over to a substitute and the administrator was placed on leave. Richland two officials didn't respond to an email asking about their current status. The students were allowed back in school.
Organizers of the protest said they plan to be at South Carolina's Statehouse next year, calling for legislators to change the law that allows police officers to arrest students for misbehaving at schools. Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott blamed that law for escalating the situation. ""Let's find a way where we don't saddle students with arrest records,"" said EfiaNwangaza from the Malcom X Center for Self Determination. ""Let's get ahead of the schoolhouse-to-jailhouse train in South Carolina."" 
 Question:What is Don Johnson's attitude towards the case? 
A. Indifferent 
B. Ambiguous 
C. Subjective 
D. Cautious

Context: When she was a girl of sixteen and before she began to work in the store , Alice had dated a young man. The young man, named Ned Currie, was older than Alice. He was employed on the local newspaper and for a long time he went to see Alice almost every evening. Together the two walked under the trees through the streets of the town and talked of what they would do with their lives. Alice was then a very pretty girl and one night Ned took her into his arms and kissed her. He became excited and said things he did not intend to say and Alice, betrayed by her desire to have something beautiful come into her narrow life, also grew excited. She also talked. The outer crust of her life , all of her natural shyness and reserve, was torn away and she gave herself over to the emotions of love.
When,late in the fall,Ned went away to Cleveland to try to get a place on a city newspaper and rise in the world , she wanted to go with him.  _ she told him what was in her mind. ""I will work and you can work,she said. ""I don't want to tie you to a needless expense that will stop you making progress. Don't marry me now. We'll get along without that and we can be together. Even though we live in the same house, no one will say anything. In the city we'll be unknown and people will pay no attention to us.""
Ned was puzzled by his sweetheart's determination and was also deeply touched. He had wanted a girlfriend just to relieve the boredom of his life but had changed his mind. He now wanted to protect her and care for her. ""You don't know what you're talking about,he said sharply; ""I'll let you do no such thing. As soon as I get a good job , I'll come back. For the present you'll have to stay here. It's the only thing we can do.
On the evening before he left Winesburg, Ned went to call on Alice. They walked about through the streets for an hour and then went for a drive in the country. The moon came up and they found themselves unable to talk. They stopped at a place where a long meadow ran down to the bank of Wine Creek and there in the dim light he kissed her and promised he would love her forever. When they returned to town, it did not seem to them that anything in the future could blot out  the wonder and beauty of that evening. ''Now we will have to stick to each other; whatever happens, we will have to do that,"" Ned said as he left the girl at her father's door.
He did not succeed in getting a place on a Cleveland newspaper and went west to Chicago. For a time he was lonely and wrote to Alice almost every day. Then he was caught up by the life of the city ;he began to make friends and found  new interests in life. In Chicago he boarded at a house where there were several women. One of them attracted his attention and he forgot Alice in Winesburg. At the end of a year he had stopped writing letters, and only once in a long time when he was lonely or when he went into one of the city parks and saw the moon shining on the grass as it had shone that night on the meadow by Wine Creek did he think of her at all. 
 Question:Which of the following words can BEST describe Ned? 
A. Protective 
B. Changeable 
C. Greedy 
D. Faithful

Context: On a cold evening I was waiting for a taxi in New York. About 5 minutes later, I was picked up by a driver, and he said how terrible some people were. I knew there was a part of me that wanted to be silent, but I had to listen out of kindness.
The man told me that he had just come from JFK Airport without a customer. During the taxi ride, what started as anger changed slowly and he mentioned that he had read an article which said that the happiest people are the ones that give, so he hoped he'd have more chance to give in his life. I was really starting to enjoy being with this man.
As we arrived at the place where I wanted to go, I paid my money by credit card. I pulled out an extra $20 and said, ""Sir, since we've been talking about giving this whole time, I want to share that feeling with you. I've already paid my money, but here's an extra little bit. You can tell the next passenger in this taxi that their ride is a gift from another.""
I thought I was pretty cool at this point, but he turned toward me, tears in his eyes, and said, ""Sir, I have a better idea. You give that $20 to a homeless person around here and I will give the next passenger a free ride myself.
It was a great honor meeting that man and learning the lesson of how everyone gives and adds joy to another with their generosity.

Context: Sarah Williams went to a boarding school.  Here is one of the

Wentworth Girls' School
Beachside
July 20th
Dearest Mom and Dad,
I'm afraid I have some very bad news for you. I have been very naughty and the school principal is very angry with me. She is going to write to you. You must come and take me away from here. She does not want me in the school any longer.
The trouble started last night when I was smoking in bed.  This is against the rules, of course. We are not supposed to smoke at all.
As I was smoking, I heard footsteps coming towards the room. I did not want a teacher to catch me smoking, so I threw the cigarette away.
Unfortunately, the cigarette fell into the waste-paper basket, which caught fire.
There was a curtain near the waste-paper basket which caught fire, too. Soon the whole room was burning.
The principal phoned for the fire department. The school is a long way from the town and by the time the fire department arrived, the whole school was in flames. Many of the girls are in the hospital.
The principal says that the fire was all my fault and you must pay for the damage. She will send you a bill for about a million dollars.
I'm very sorry about this.
Much love,
Sarah
P. S. None of the above is true, but I have failed my exams. I just want you to know how bad things could have been!

Context: What is the hottest topic at your school recently? In Taiyuan No.55 Middle School, it's money.
The school held an activity called ""making money"" last weekend. About 200 Junior 1 and Junior 2 students were divided into 30 teams. They went out to make money by selling things.
What did they choose to sell? Some sold newspapers; some chose bottled water; some sold environmentally friendly shopping bags and bamboo baskets.
Hu Qing's team decided to sell some useful books in front of the Children Activity Center. They thought parents would like to buy the books for their children.

""Finally we had to give up.""
Wang Bing and her team sold ice cream in a square. They didn't meet any officers. But few people were interested in what they were selling. The team then put up a board saying ""For Country Kids"".

Context: At 10 years old, Flynn Mc Garry became sick of the meals his mother cooked for him. So the Los Angeles native took matters into his own hands and started making his own dinners. One of his specialties? Trout with braised leeks .
Now 13, the young chef is being praised as a ""food prodigy "". He will spend his summer apprenticing with some of the best chefs at LA's famous restaurants, MSNBC Nightly New reports.
Mc Garry began making a name for himself in the culinary  world when John Sedlar, owner of the trendy Playa Restaurant, let Mc Garry take over the kitchen for a special nine-course meal. The meal sold out almost instantly.
""Flynn is a very unusual young man, and he's very, very passionate,"" owner John Sedlar told MSNBC.
By usual teenage boy standards, it's true. So strong is his passion for cooking that the young man has turned his bedroom into an experimental kitchen laboratory.
Instead of video game consoles, baseball trophies and movie posters, Mc Garry's room is lined with mixers, pots and pans, cutting boards and a stainless steel worktable. It's where Mc Garry cooks his monthly pop-up dinners, which are served from his family's dining room, a monthly supper club he calls Eureka.
Mc Garry is deft  and confident in the kitchen, with skills he's been practicing since he was a child. What started out as a means of self-preservation from his mom's unsatisfactory cooking has turned into a passion that the teen hopes to develop into a career.
""My goal? Michelin three stars, a restaurant in the top 50 list,"" he told MSNBC. ""Hopefully the top five."" Meanwhile, Mc Garry's 13-year-old resume is already richer and more impressive than most cooks many times his age.
Mc Garry isn't the only talented young prodigy to surprise experts in his field in recent years. At just 17 years old, physicist Taylor Wilson is already teaching graduate-level courses in physics and has built a functioning nuclear reactor. 
 Question:Compared with many adult chefs, Mc Garry   _  . 
A. has the best cooking equipment in his kitchen 
B. is inventive and has many new specialties to his name 
C. has much and impressive cooking experience for his young age 
D. wants to open his own Michelin three-star restaurant

Context: An Outstanding Teacher  
Ben put the white envelope into the mailbox. He felt proud, excited, and happy--and also a little nervous about whether his essay would win.
Ben's local newspaper had advertised a contest inviting students to submit essays in honor of a remarkable teacher. The newspaper would choose the five best essays and print them in the paper. As soon as Ben heard about the contest, he knew he wanted to write about Mrs. Gruen.
Mrs. Gruen was always so friendly and patient, and she always had something encouraging to say to her students. Even more importantly, she knew how to make science interesting and enjoyable. Before being in her class, Ben would have said he was uninterested in science, but now science was his favorite subject.
At first, Ben had struggled with his essay. After he finished his first draft, he asked his older sister, Hannah, to review it. Eventually, after many more revisions, the essay was ready to mail. As Ben stood before the mailbox, he imagined how surprised Mrs. Gruen would be  to open the newspaper and see her name in print. 
When the big day finally came, Ben opened the newspaper and eagerly studied the columns of print for the essay he had written. He did not see his essay anywhere. He turned through all of the pages, but it was not there! Instead, he saw five other essays talking about five other teachers. Ben felt like a balloon that had suddenly lost all its air.
A few days later in science class, Mrs. Gruen asked Ben to stay after class for a few minutes. ""Your sister stopped by yesterday,"" Mrs. Gruen told Ben. ""She brought me the most wonderful gift."" Ben saw that Mrs. Gruen was holding a copy of his essay. ""You have no idea how much it means to me that you enjoy my class and think I'm a good teacher. No reward or honor could ever be greater than this essay,"" said Mrs. Gruen.
""OK,"" Ben said, ""I meant everything I wrote."" Then he stepped into the hallway with his head held high. 
 Question:What did Mrs. Gruen think of Ben's essay? 
A. It built up her reputation. 
B. It was a great honor to her. 
C. It helped Ben make progress. 
D. It deserved to win an award.

Context: Life is filled with challenges. As we get older, we come to realize that those challenges are the very things that shape us and make us who we are. It is the same with the challenges that come with friendship. When we are faced with a challenge, we usually have two choices. We can try to beat it off, or we can decide that the thing presenting the challenge isn't worth the trouble and call it quits. Although there are certainly times when calling it quits is the right thing to do, in most cases all that is needed is commitment and communication.
When we are committed to something, it means that no matter how painful or how uncomfortable something is, we will always choose to face it through instead of running away from it. Communication is making a space for discussion and talking about how you feel as opposed to just saying what the other person did wrong. If you can say to a friend, ""I got my feelings hurt"", rather than ""You hurt my feelings"", you are going to be able to solve the problem much faster.
In dealing with many challenges that friendship will bring to you, try to see them for what they are: small hurdles you need to jump or get through on your way through life. Nothing is so big that it is impossible to get over, and hurt only serves to make us stronger. It is all part of growing up, it happens to everyone, and some day you will look back on all of this and say, ""Hard as it was, it made me who I am today. And that is a good thing."" 
 Question:If your friend hurts your feelings, you are advised to   _  . 
A. point out your friend's mistake 
B. calm yourself down 
C. start a proper conversation 
D. run away from it 
 Answer: C
Context: Dear Mary,
I am not happy these days. I am new in this class, you know, but I don' t have any friends here. I always have to keep quiet and put my heart into my study. I thought things would be fine.

Some students make fun of me. I feel hurt , but I don't show my anger. In fact, I have to hide  my unhappiness. I feel terrible.

Context: An Outstanding Teacher  
Ben put the white envelope into the mailbox. He felt proud, excited, and happy--and also a little nervous about whether his essay would win.
Ben's local newspaper had advertised a contest inviting students to submit essays in honor of a remarkable teacher. The newspaper would choose the five best essays and print them in the paper. As soon as Ben heard about the contest, he knew he wanted to write about Mrs. Gruen.
Mrs. Gruen was always so friendly and patient, and she always had something encouraging to say to her students. Even more importantly, she knew how to make science interesting and enjoyable. Before being in her class, Ben would have said he was uninterested in science, but now science was his favorite subject.
At first, Ben had struggled with his essay. After he finished his first draft, he asked his older sister, Hannah, to review it. Eventually, after many more revisions, the essay was ready to mail. As Ben stood before the mailbox, he imagined how surprised Mrs. Gruen would be  to open the newspaper and see her name in print. 
When the big day finally came, Ben opened the newspaper and eagerly studied the columns of print for the essay he had written. He did not see his essay anywhere. He turned through all of the pages, but it was not there! Instead, he saw five other essays talking about five other teachers. Ben felt like a balloon that had suddenly lost all its air.
A few days later in science class, Mrs. Gruen asked Ben to stay after class for a few minutes. ""Your sister stopped by yesterday,"" Mrs. Gruen told Ben. ""She brought me the most wonderful gift."" Ben saw that Mrs. Gruen was holding a copy of his essay. ""You have no idea how much it means to me that you enjoy my class and think I'm a good teacher. No reward or honor could ever be greater than this essay,"" said Mrs. Gruen.
""OK,"" Ben said, ""I meant everything I wrote."" Then he stepped into the hallway with his head held high. 
 Question:What did Mrs. Gruen think of Ben's essay? 
A. It built up her reputation. 
B. It was a great honor to her. 
C. It helped Ben make progress. 
D. It deserved to win an award.

Context: A story happened when the telegraph was the fastest method of long-distance communication. One day, a young man went to an interview for a job as a Morse code operator .
Answering the ad in the newspaper, he went to the office address. When he arrived, he walked into a large, busy office filled with noise, including the sound of the telegraph. An office worker asked him to wait until he was called to go into the inner office. Seven other people were already in the waiting area for the interview. The young man sat down and waited with them. After a few minutes, the young man stood up, crossed the room to the door of the inner office, and walked right in. Naturally the other people wondered what was going on. They were sure that the young man made a mistake and would be refused.
A few minutes later, however, the boss came out of the inner office with the young man and said to the other people,""Gentlemen,thank you very much for coming, but the young man has got the job.""
The other people were surprised, and one of them said, ""Wait a minute. I don't understand. He was the last to come in, and we never even got a chance to be interviewed. Yet he got the job. That's not fair!""
The boss said, ""I'm sorry, but all the time you've been sitting here, the telegraph has been sending out the following message in Mores code: 'If you understand this message, then come right in. The job is yours.' None of you heard it or understood it. This young man did. The job is this."" 
 Question:How many people went fot the job interview that day? 
A. 7 
B. 8 
C. 9 
D. 10 
 Answer: B
Context: A full stop is used at the end of an idea or thought, and is an important rule in proper grammar. But text messages are changing the rules, as a new study finds digital messages ending with one aren't sincere. The results suggest skipping punctuation altogether, as it indicates you are answering naturally and heartfelt.
Binghamton University's Harpur College observed 126 students, who read a series of messages displayed as texts on a screen or handwritten notes on loose-leaf paper . In the 16 experimental exchanges, the sender's message contained a statement followed by an invitation phrased as a question such as, ""Dave gave me his extra ticket. Wanna come?"" The receiver then gave a one-word response like ""Okay"", ""Sure"", ""Yeah"" or ""Yup"". Half of the participants' responses were with a full stop and the other half did not use it. Based on the responses, text messages that ended with a full stop were rated less sincere than those that did not end with one. The students who read the notes on the paper reported that full stop or not, they felt the message was sincere. These results suggest that punctuation can misconstrue or influence the meaning of text messages. The study concludes, "" _ ""
""Texting is lacking many of the social cues used in actual face-to-face conversations"", said Celia Klin, associate professor of psychology at Binghamton University's Harpur College. ""When speaking, people easily convey social and emotional information with eye gaze, facial expressions, tone of voice, pauses, and so on. People obviously can't use these mechanisms when they are texting. Thus, it makes sense that texters rely on what they have available to them -- emoticons, deliberate misspellings that mimic speech sounds  and, according to our data, punctuation. ""
Recently, Klin's team conducted a follow-up study and found that text response with an exclamation mark  is interpreted as more sincere. ""That's not surprising, but it broadens our claim,""saidKlin. ""Punctuation is used and understood by texters to convey emotions and other social and practical information. Given that people are wonderfully good at communicating complex information in conversations, it's not surprising that as texting evolves, people are finding ways to convey the same types of information in their texts. "" 
 Question:Compared with face-to-face conversations, which of the following can text messages rely on to convey their meaning? 
A. Eye contact 
B. Tone of voice 
C. Emoticons 
D. Gestures

Context: One evening after dinner, Mr. and Mrs. Tisich called a family meeting. ""We've had to make a difficult decision,"" Mr. Tisich announced. ""You see, your mother has been offered a post as co-director of a television station in Chicago. Unfortunately, the station is not here. After thinking long and hard about it, we've concluded that the right decision is to move to Chicago."" Marc looked shocked, while his sister Rachel breathlessly started asking when they'd be moving. ""It's surprising, but exciting!"" she said. Marc simply said, ""We can't go--I can't leave all my friends. I'd rather stay here and live with Tommy Lyons!""
The Tisichs hoped that by the time they moved in August, Marc would grow more used to the idea of leaving. However, he showed no signs of accepting the news, refusing to pack his belongings. When the morning of the move arrived, Marc was nowhere to be found. His parents called Tommy Lyon's house, but Mrs. Lyons said she hadn't seen Marc. Mrs. Tisich became increasingly concerned, while her husband felt angry with their son for behaving so irresponsibly.
What they didn't know was that Marc had started walking over to Tommy's house, with a faint idea of hiding in Lyons's attic  for a few days. But something happened on the way as Marc walked past all the familiar landscape of the neighborhood: the fence that he and his mother painted, the tree that he and his sister used to climb, the park where he and his father often took evening walks together. How much would these mean without his family, who make them special in the first place? Marc didn't take the time to answer that question but instead hurried back to his house, wondering if there were any moving cartons the right size to hold his record collection. 
 Question:The reason for Marc's going home was that  _  . 
A. he did not want to be left behind 
B. he realized his family was important to him 
C. he hoped to reach an agreement with his parents 
D. he wished to be a more responsible person

The night before the first exam, Barbala insisted that she should have an early night and take a sleeping pill. She promised to wake her in the morning.
As she was falling asleep, Kate was worried in case she over-slept. Her mind kept jumping from subject to subject. At last, with the help of the pill, she fell asleep. she was sitting in the examination hall, looking at the paper. She couldn't answer any of the questions. Everyone round her was writing pages and pages. However hard she thought, she couldn't find anything to write about. She kept looking at her watch. Time was running out. There was only one hour left.

Context: The girl was hanging by her hands from the railings of a balcony . The balcony was on the twelfth floor of the high-rise block next to his. His flat was on the ninth floor and he had to look up to see her. It was half-past six in the morning. He had been awakened by the sound of an aircraft flying dangerously low overhead, and had got out of bed to look. His sleepy eyes, moved from the blue sky which was empty of cloud, empty of anything but the bright disappearing arrow of the aircraft, and then rested on the hanging figure.
He really thought he must be dreaming, for this sunrise time was the hour for dreams. Then, when he knew he wasn't, he decided it must be a scene in a film. There were cameramen down there, a whole film unit, and all the correct safety precautions had been taken. Probably the girl wasn't even a real girl, but a dummy . He opened the window and looked down. The car park, paved courts, grass spaces between the blocks, all were deserted. On the balcony rail one of the dummy's hands moved, desperately. He had to believe then what was obviously happening. The girl was trying to kill herself. She had lost her courage and now was trying to stay alive. All these thoughts and conclusions of his occupied about thirty seconds. Then he acted. He picked up the phone and dialed the emergency number for the police.
The arrival of the police cars and the rescue of the girl became the focus of talk for the people of the two blocks. Someone found out that it was he who had called the police and he became an unwilling hero. He was a modest, quiet young man, and was in relief when the talk began to die away. Again he was able to enter and leave his flat without being pointed at as a kind of St George and sometimes even congratulated.
About a fortnight after that morning, he was getting ready to go to the theatre, just putting on his overcoat, when the doorbell rang. He didn't recognize the girl who stood outside. He had never seen her face. She said, ""I'm Lydia Simpson. You saved my life. I've come to thank you.""

B. the girl was unwilling to be rescued

Context: One day, Mary asked her mother, ""Mum, what do people mean by saying they have a skeleton in the closet ?"" Her mother paused thoughtfully and said, ""Well, it's something that you would rather not have anyone else know about. For example, if in the past, someone in Dad's family had been arrested for stealing a horse, it would be a skeleton in his family's closet. He really wouldn't want any neighbor to know about it.""
""Why pick my family?"" Mary's father said with anger. ""Your family history isn't so good, you know. Wasn't your great-great-grandfather a prisoner who was transported to Australia for his crimes?""  ""Yes, but people these days say that you are not a real Australian unless your ancestors arrived as prisoners."" ""Gosh, sorry I asked. I think I understand now."" Mary cut in before things grew worse.
After dinner, the house was quiet. Mary's parents were quite angry with each other. Her mother was ironing clothes and every now and then she glared at her husband, who hid behind his newspaper pretending to read. When she finished, she gathered the freshly pressed clothes in her arms and walked to Mary's closet. Just as she opened the door and reached in to hang a skirt, a bony arm stuck out from the dark depths and a bundle of white bones fell to the floor. Mary's mother sank into a faint , waking only when Mary put a cold, wet cloth on her forehead. She looked up to see the worried faces of her husband and daughter.
""What happened? Where am I?"" she asked. ""You just destroyed the school's skeleton, Mum,"" explained Mary. ""I brought it home to help me with my health project. I meant to tell you, but it seemed that as soon as I mentioned skeletons and closets, it caused a problem between you and Dad."" Mary looked in amazement as her parents began to laugh madly. ""They're crazy,"" she thought. Ks5u

Context: ""Find a job you love, and you'll never work a day in your life."" Do you agree with this old saying? Joanne Gordon does. She is the author of Be Happy at work and other books about careers . Gordon believes that about 30% of employees  in North America do not like their jobs, and she thinks that is terrible. She wants to help people who do not feel satisfied with their jobs find work that is good for them. Joanne says, ""There are no happy jobs, only happy workers."" She believes that happy workers share three main characteristics.
First, happy workers enjoy the daily activities of their jobs, and they look forward to the workday. Take Tony Hawk, for example. At age 14, he became a professional skateboarder. Now he is a businessman working on projects related to skateboarding--films and video games, but he still skates every day. He once said, ""My youngest son's pre-school was recently asked what their dads do for work. My son said, 'I've never seen my dad do work.'"" Tony agrees that his job doesn't look like work. He has found a way to spend each day doing a job he enjoys.
Second, happy workers like the people they work with. Sally Ayote says, ""I work with the coolest people in the world."" She and her group cook for almost 1,200 people in Antarctica. Most of these people are scientists who are doing research. Sally loves to sit and talk with them. She says, ""There is no television here, no radio, so I get to know the scientists and what they're studying."" Sally thinks she has a great job, and the best part about it is the people.
Third, happy workers know that their work helps others. Caroline Baron's work helps people who have had to leave their home countries because of war or other dangers. She is a filmmaker who started an organization called FilmAid, which shows movies in refugee  camps around the world. Caroline believes that movies can be very helpful in these camps. For one thing, entertaining movies let refugees forget their troubles for a little while. Movies can also teach important subjects like health and safety. For example, in one camp, thousands of refugees saw a movie about how to get clean water. Caroline knows that is helping other people, and this makes her feel proud and happy about her work.
Tony Hawk, Sally Ayote, and Caroline Baron all get great satisfaction from their work. Tony Hawk says, ""Find the thing you love. If you are doing what you love, there is much more happiness there than being rich or famous."" Joanne Gordon would agree. She encourages people to find something they enjoy doing, find people they like to work with, and find ways to help others. Then they can be proud of what they do, and they will probably be happy at work. 
 Question:Who is the book, Be Happy at Work, written for? 
A. Joanne Gordon herself. 
B. Tony Hawk, Sally Ayote, and Caroline Baron. 
C. People who do not feel satisfied with their jobs. 
D. The workers who agree with the author's ideas.

Context: Our cat has a sweet nature, and she can let us know what she wants. When we fail to meet her needs, she gently leads us in the proper direction. When I forget to fill her water bowl early in the morning, she runs after my legs, and then pushes me in the direction of her bowl. She doesn't get irritated  ; instead, she expresses her wishes in the best way. And I always understand what she is telling me.
One day I found myself envying   her simple expression. How many times had I expected my husband or my children to know my wants without my ever giving voice to them? How many times had I been disappointed that they couldn't understand when I needed a hug, a compliment   or a chocolate bar?
After a pleasant afternoon with my husband, I wanted to stop somewhere nice and have dinner, but he didn't understand my hints  . ""Couldn't you see that I wanted to go out to dinner?"" I complained when he pulled into our driveway.
""Why didn't you say so? I can't read your mind,"" he answered in impatience. _ . Had I expected him to read my mind? Why hadn't I expressed my desire more clearly? I realized I had fallen into the female trap of ""If you love me, you can read my mind.""
Now, I state my needs clearly and directly. I look at my cat and know she agrees. 
 Question:What will the author do if she wants something from her husband now? 
A. She will give him her hints. 
B. She lets him guess what she wants. 
C. She tells him her needs directly. 
D. She buys what she wants herself. 
 Answer: C

Context: Allan is eight this year and he's in Grade Two. The boy is clever and can answer all the questions in class. But he hates to stay in the classroom for more than half an hour.

His teachers tell his parents about it. He has to make a promise that he won't do that again. But soon he will forget it.
The teachers think he does well in his lessons and don't mind it.
One Saturday evening Allan finished his homework as soon as he had supper. He turned on the television, but there was no football match on TV.
He found all the programmes were not interesting and turned it off. He saw his sister Mabel doing her homework in her bedroom. He decided to play a joke on her.

""It doesn't matter, dear,"" said his mother. ""The best present is to be a good boy. Don't be naughty , my son, or your child will be naughty, too! ""

""You see, your mother has been offered a post as co-director of a television station in Chicago. Unfortunately, the station is not here. After thinking long and hard about it, we've concluded that the right decision is to move to Chicago."" Marc looked shocked, while his sister Rachel breathlessly started asking when they'd be moving. ""It's surprising, but exciting!"" she said. Marc simply said, ""We can't go--I can't leave all my friends. I'd rather stay here and live with Tommy Lyons!""
The Tisichs hoped that by the time they moved in August, Marc would grow more used to the idea of leaving. However, he showed no signs of accepting the news, refusing to pack his belongings. When the morning of the move arrived, Marc was nowhere to be found. His parents called Tommy Lyon's house, but Mrs. Lyons said she hadn't seen Marc. Mrs. Tisich became increasingly concerned, while her husband felt angry with their son for behaving so irresponsibly.
What they didn't know was that Marc had started walking over to Tommy's house, with a faint idea of hiding in Lyons's attic  for a few days. But something happened on the way as Marc walked past all the familiar landscape of the neighborhood: the fence that he and his mother painted, the tree that he and his sister used to climb, the park where he and his father often took evening walks together. How much would these mean without his family, who make them special in the first place? Marc didn't take the time to answer that question but instead hurried back to his house, wondering if there were any moving cartons the right size to hold his record collection. 
 Question:The reason for Marc's going home was that  _  . 
A. he did not want to be left behind 
B. he realized his family was important to him 
C. he hoped to reach an agreement with his parents 
D. he wished to be a more responsible person

Context: My conscience was pricked again on a tour of Venice in 2010. I had taken refuge  from the crowds in a quiet canal-side cafe. Outside the cafe was an old woman kneeling on the ancient cobbled stones, begging. Steady streams of tourists were walking past her. A lone young back-packer stood away from the throng drinking something, but I noticed he was also observing the woman.
A tourist group glanced at the woman and walked on. Another group of tourists arrived and, again, walked past her. The backpacker watched. Then, as I prepared to leave, I stopped at the sight of the backpacker stepping forward and placing some money in the woman's cup. He did this rather ostentatiously , just before the arrival of another tourist group. I watched as the leader of the group stopped and put some money in the cup. Having been shown the way, other tourists followed suit and added more coins to the woman's cup.
The young backpacker repeated this process in front of the next tour party going past. Once again, the subtle peer  pressure worked on the tourists, who all added coins to the cup. His work done, the young man walked over to the old beggar woman, patted her shoulder and said, ""I hope that helps a bit.""
I don't know if the woman understood his English or realized what had just happened, but I did. I placed some money in the woman's cup and continued my travels, light-hearted after witnessing such an astute act of caring. 
 Question:We can infer from the passage that   _  . 
A. people can do kind acts due to peer pressure 
B. people usually have pity on an old beggar 
C. tourists can be cheated by beggars 
D. tourists are willing to help beggars

Context: Being able to count at least ten people as friends makes us happy, but those with five or fewer are likely to be miserable, researchers say. Their study of hundreds of men and women also found t hat people who feel satisfied with their lives always have lots of close friends and regularly make new ones. While it is not clear whether our friends make us happy or we make friends because we are happy, the researchers say it is clear that we should maintain our friendships. Psychologist RichardTunney said, ""Whatever the reason is, actively working on friendships in the same way as to maintain a marriage is a prerequisite  to happiness. ""Dr. Tunney, of Nottingham University, quizzed more than 1,700 people about their satisfaction  with their lives and the state of their friendships. Those with five friends or fewer had just a 40 percent chance of being happy.  In other words they were more likely to be unhappy than happy. Ten was the first number at which people were more likely to be happy than unhappy. The happiest people were those with dozens of friends, according to the study, which was carried out for the National Lottery .
For women, this meant having 33 friends;for men, the number was 49. Dr. Tunney said,""People who were extremely satisfied with their lives had twice the number of friends of people  who were extremely dissatisfied. "" Women tended to have fewer friends than men but formed tighter relationships. Interestingly, the study found that childhood friends are no more likely to make us happy than people we become close to later in life. Lottery winners, however, have a differentopinion on life. They are always happier than others despite spending their time with asmall circle of old friends. This could be because they trust people they've known for along time. 
 Question:What's the best title for this passage? 
A. The Secret to Happiness Is to Make New Friends 
B. Having at Least 10 Good Friends Makes People Happy 
C. Why Most People Like to Make Friends Regularly 
D. Men's and Women's Friends Are Different 
 Answer: B
Context: Happiness is contagious  , as researchers reported on Thursday.
People with the most social connections -- spouses, friends, neighbors and relatives -- were also the happiest, the data showed. ""Each additional happy person makes you happier,"" Christakis said.
""Imagine that I am connected to you and you are connected to others and others are connected to still others. It is this fabric of humanity, like an American patch quilt.""
Each person sits on a different colored patch. ""Imagine that these patches are happy and unhappy patches. Your happiness depends on what is going on in the patch around you,"" Christakis said.
""It is not just happy people connecting with happy people, which they do. Above and beyond, there is this contagious process going on.""
And happiness is more contagious than unhappiness, they discovered.
""If a social contact is happy, it increases the likelihood that you are happy by 15 percent, "" Fowler said. ""A friend of a friend, or the friend of a spouse or a sibling  , if they are happy, increases your chances by 10 percent,"" he added.
A happy third degree friend -- the friend of a friend of a friend -- increases a person's chances of being happy by 6 percent.
""But every extra unhappy friend increases the likelihood that you'll be unhappy by 7 percent,"" Fowler said.
The finding is interesting and it is useful, too, Fowler said.
""Among other benefits, happiness has been shown to have an important effect on reduced mortality  , pain reduction, and improved cardiac   function. So better understanding of how happiness spreads can help us learn how to develop a healthier society,"" he said.
The study also fits in with other data suggested in 1984 that having $ 5,000 extra increased a person's chances of becoming happier by about 2 percent.
""A happy friend is worth about $ 20,000,"" Christakis said. 
 Question:Which of the following will increase your chances of becoming happier most? 
A. Being in a party with a happy atmosphere. 
B. A happy experience of your brother or your parents. 
C. A happy trip to a foreign country of your friends. 
D. Happiness of your friend's friend.

Context: The drug store was closing for the night and Alfred Higgins was about to go home when his new boss approached him.
""Empty your pockets please, Alfred,"" Sam Carr demanded in a firm voice.
Alfred pretended to be shocked but he knew he had been caught. From his coat he withdrew a make-up kit, a lipstick and two tubes of toothpaste.
""I'm disappointed in you, Alfred!"" said the little gray-haired man.
""Sorry, sir. Please forgive me. It's the first time I've ever done such a thing,"" Alfred lied, hoping to gain the old man's sympathy.
Mr Carr's brow furrowed as he reached for the telephone, ""Do you take me for a fool? Let's see what the police have to say. But first I'll call your mother and let her know her son is heading to jail.""
""Do whatever you want,"" Alfred shot back, trying to sound big. But deep down he felt like a child. He imagined his mother rushing in, eyes burning with anger, maybe in tears. Yet he wanted to come quickly before Mr. Carr called the police.
Mr. Carr was surprised when Mrs. Higgins finally arrived . She was very calm, quiet and friendly. ""Is Alfred in trouble?"" she asked.
""He's been stealing from the store,"" the old man coolly replied.
Mrs. Higgins pulled out her hand and touched Mr. Carr's arm with great gentleness as if she knew just how he felt. She spoke as if she did not want to cause him any more trouble. ""What do you want to do, Mr.Carr?""
The woman's calm and gentle manner _ the once-angry store-owner, ""I was going to get a cop. But I don't want to be cruel. Tell your son not to come back here again and I will let it go."" Then he warmly shook Mrs. Higgins' hand.
Mrs. Higgins thanked the old ma for his kindness, then mother and son left. They walked along the street in silence. When they arrived home his mother simply said, ""Go to bed, you fool.""
In his bedroom, Alfred heard his mother in the kitchen. He felt no shame, only pride in his mother's actions. ""She was smooth!"" he thought. He went to the kitchen to tell her how great she was, but was shocked by what he saw.
His mother's face looked frightened, broken. Not the cool, bright face he saw earlier. Her lips moved nervously. She looked very old. There were tears in her eyes.
This picture of his mother made him want to cry. He felt his youth ending. He saw all the troubles he brought her and the deep lines of worry in her grey face. It seemed to him that this was the first time he had ever really seen his mother. 
 Question:What was the mother's attitude towards Alfred?

John agreed.  The boss asked him to go and find anyone selling watermelons in the market. John went and returned soon. He said he had found a man selling water melons. The boss asked how much they per kilo. John shook his head and went back to the seller to ask and returned to tell the boss $1.2 per kilo.

Context: How do you design a pay plan that motivates people to do their best work? A new study by three Harvard researchers suggests a novel answer: Shortly after you hire new workers, give them a raise.
""Previous research has shown that paying people more than they expect may elicit reciprocity  in the form of greater productivity,"" notes Deepak Malhotra, a Harvard business-administration professor who worked on the study. What he and his colleagues found, however, was that the connection between more pay and extra effort depends on presenting the increase ""as a gift--that is, as something you've chosen to do purely as a nice gesture, with no strings attached.""
Malhotra and his team studied 267 people hired by oDesk, a global online network of freelancers, to do a one-time data-entry project for four hours. All of the new hires were people in developing countries, for whom hourly wages of $3 and $4 were higher than what they had been making in previous jobs.
The researchers split the group up into three equal parts. One group was told they would earn $3 an hour. A second group was initially hired at $3 an hour but, before they started working, they got a surprise: The budget for the project had expanded unexpectedly, they were told, and they would now be paid $4 an hour. The third group was offered $4 an hour from the start and given no increase.
Even though the second and third groups were eventually paid the same amount, the second group worked harder and produced more--about 20% more--than either of the other two. People in the second group also showed the most _ , maintaining their focus all the way through the assigned task and performing especially well toward the end of the four hours. Interestingly, the more experienced employees in the high-performing group were the most productive of all, apparently because their previous work experience led them to appreciate the rarity of an unexpected raise.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, Malhotra points out that higher pay, in and of itself, didn't promote productivity: People who made $4 an hour from the beginning worked no harder than those who were hired at $3 and were then paid $3.
To get the most impact from their pay plans, he adds, companies might consider not only what to pay new hires, but when to pay it.
""The key thing is how you present [the reason for an increase],"" he says. Doling out extra money could promote productivity most ""if you make it clear that the pay raise is something you're choosing to do just because you can. Our theory is that people will reciprocate. If you do something nice, they'll do something nice back."" 
 Question:Which of the following is true about the research? 
A. None of the participants earned more than $4 an hour in previous jobs. 
B. 89 of the participants got a $1 wage raise for their high productivity. 
C. It was so important that the budget for it was increased in the process. 
D. Stamina shown in it was positively related to the amount of money paid.

Context: Many television programmes are very realistic. One who watches TV often feels that whatever happened in the film could well happen to him. With only a little imagination, every man in the street becomes a thief, a spy or a murderer. Jane had been watching a spy film at her friend's house. In it, a young girl had been followed and murdered. She felt a little frightened, walking to the station. She took a train back to the centre of the city. There were a lot of people traveling with her, so she felt much safer.
A man sitting opposite her, reading a newspaper, glanced at her. She thought nothing of it until she saw him staring at her. Remember the film and feeling very uncomfortable, she got off the train and went to the bus stop. When he got on the same bus as she did, she found that he was following her. As long as she had been with other people she wasn't frightened. But when she got off the bus, the streets were almost empty. She walked as quickly as she could. She could hear footsteps following her but she didn't dare to look around. After what seemed to have been hours, she was unable to find them, because she was so frightened. The footsteps stopped behind her. She felt a hand on her shoulder. Instead of feeling hands round her neck, however, she heard a pleasant voice. ""I apologize if I frightened you. I'm your new neighbour. I thought I recognized you in the train, but I wasn't sure."" 
 Question:The man put his hand on her shoulder. He meant to   _   Jane. 
A. kill

Mr. Smith had a very important meeting at the House of Commons and had to get there but no one could take him. He tried to walk there but found he was quite lost. Suddenly he bumped into a stranger. The stranger asked if he could help him. Mr. Smith said he wanted to get to the Houses of Parliament. The stranger told him he would take him there. Mr. Smith thanked him and they started to walk there. The fog was getting thicker every minute but the stranger had no difficulty in finding the way. He went along one street, turned down another, crossed a square and at last after about half an hour's walk they arrived at the Houses of Parliament. Mr. Smith couldn't understand how the stranger found his way. ""It is wonderful,"" he said. ""How do you find the way in the fog?""
""It is no trouble at all to me,"" said the stranger, ""I am blind.""

Context: I used to hate my mother because she worked a lot and didn't spend much time with me. Then one Friday morning I took part in a three-day self-help program for teenagers. Whether you believe it or not, that weekend changed my life.
About 100 other teenagers were there. During the first two days I met a lot of great people. I was glad because I made so many friends there.
On Sunday, the leader did an interesting exercise called ""Chocolate or Toys"". He asked a girl which she liked better, chocolate or toys. She chose chocolate. Then he asked her to choose again between chocolate and chocolate. Of course, she didn't have a choice.
This exercise told us that sometimes we don't have a choice in life, and that sometimes we have to accept something, rather than complaining .
A girl stood up and started talking about her mom who was a drug addict  and how much she hated her mother.
""I want a new mom,"" she cried.
""Unluckily, you can't have one,"" the leader replied.
""You have to accept the mother that you have.""
This hit me hard. I realized that, for better or worse, my mom was my mom. I couldn't choose another mom, but I could try to make the best of the situation. 
 Question:The writer used to hate his mother because   _  .

C. she was a drug addict. 
D. she was too strict with him. 
 Answer: B
Context: Self-control can make you happier not only in the long-run, but also in the moment.
The research showed that self-control isn't about giving up desires, but more about managing conflicting goals. Since most people consider highly self-controlled ones as being more task-centered, the scientists decided to find out the connection between self-control and people's happiness to determine if being self-disciplined leaves people feel less joyful.
Through a set of tests-including one that assessed 414 middle-aged participants on self-control and another that randomly interviewed volunteers on their smart phones about their mood and any desires they might be experiencing, researchers found a strong connection between higher levels of self-control and satisfaction.
The smart phone experiment also showed how self-control may improve mood. Those who showed the greatest self-control reported more good moods and fewer bad ones. But this didn't appear to be linked to being more able to resist temptation --it was because they exposed themselves to fewer situations that might inspire desires in the first place. They were doing a number of things that bring them happiness and avoiding problematic desires and conflicts.
That became clear in the study's last experiment, which looked into how self-control affects the way people handle goals that conflict with one another. In particular, the researchers were interested in how self-disciplined and less-disciplined people differed when it came to choosing among ""virtues"" and ""vices"" like the pleasure of eating sugar cookie vs. the pain of gaining weight. Participants were asked to list three important goal conflicts they experienced regularly and were also questioned on how they managed to balance the goals.
The highly self-controlled showed an obvious difference from those with less discipline over their lives. They tended to avoid creating situations in which their goals would conflict, and reported fewer instances of having to choose between short-term pleasure and long-term pain. As a result, they experienced fewer negative emotions.
And self-control doesn't always mean _ : it may mean saving now to get big payoff later. For dieters, it means making choices to avoid entering a bakery since you are more likely to buy a cupcake. Granted, self-control isn't the best way to instant satisfaction, but it may bring something even better: long-term contentment. 
 Question:Different from the less-controlled ones, the highly self-controlled people  _  . 
A. rarely prefer pleasures 
B. often create conflicting goals 
C. like to put up with pain 
D. stay away from negative emotions

Context: Danger-junkie orangutans  in Borneo climb dead trees and shake then until they begin to fall. They scream with excitement as they cling to the falling tree. Just before the tree hits the ground the orangutans leap to another tree or vine, narrowly escaping death. While no one cab ask orangutans if they enjoy it as a person playing an extreme sport, one animal behaviorist sees this monkey fun as a bit of harmless thrill-seeking.
A growing number of scientists agree that animals are conscious and capable of experiencing basic emotions , such as happiness, sadness, boredom or depression. A few scientists even see the possibility for higher animal emotions like love, jealousy and spite.
Five years ago, behaviorist and animal-rights activist Dr. Jonathan Balcombe stood on a Virginia hotel balcony watching two crows intimately groom   each other in the comfort of an abandoned billboard. He felt that the birds liked what they were doing, even if engaged in a natural, beneficial act, such as picking parasites   off the other's feathers. That moment changed the way he would view animals forever and led to a book, ""Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good"", which is filled with hundreds of examples of animals living it up thanks to developed senses of touch, taste, sight, sound and smell.
Balcombe recounts a favorite example of Kenyan hippos   having high-end spa treatment in a fresh water spring. They splay their toes, open their mouths wide and wait for a school of cleaner fish to remove parasites and slough off dead skin, he recalls. Balcombe knows that the hippos and the fish both benefit from this arrangement. ""My interpretation is that it is also enjoyable for them ,"" he says. 
 Question:We can conclude from the passage that   _  . 
A. only a few animals have emotions 
B. Balcombe's theory is not supported by other scientists 
C. Balcombe has watched a lot of animals showing emotions 
D. Balcombe can understand animal language 
 Answer: C
Context: There is a famous English saying ""You are what you eat"", and _ means what you put in your mouth will become part of you. Many experts   use it to tell people it's important to have a good eating habit. For example, too much sweet food makes a person overweight . To avoid being fat, kids are told to keep off sweet food. But, a team of American scientists have found something new about eating sweet food.
""When we say some people 'sweet', we mean they are kind and friendly to us. Perhaps  this word can help us learn more about people's feelings and acts."" said Brian Meier, a scientist from the study team. ""Taste is something we experience every day. What we have done is to find whether we can know someone's character  and behavior  depending on their taste.""
In one of their experiments ,  students were asked questions about their character-whether, for example, they were soft-hearted or not. Then they were asked to make a list of their favorite food. According to their answers, the scientists found that the students who liked sweet food were nicer.
In their another experiment, the scientists found that people who preferred sweet food such as cookies and chocolate were more willing to help other people in need, and those who ate non-sweet food such as chips weren't. For example, people with a sweet tooth were more likely to volunteer to clean up their city, visit sick children in the hospital and so on.
The result of the experiments is that people's helpfulness or being nice has something to do with their taste for sweet food. So eating sweet food is a useful way to make people nice and helpful. Next time, try some ice-cream.
,. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the followings is NOT true? 
A. There is some relationship between someone's character and their taste. 
B. Kids are told to keep away from sweet food to be fat. 
C. What you put in your mouth will show your character.

Context: Every morning, the newspaper chief editor  holds a meeting with the reporters. They discuss the main events  of the day. Reporters are then sent to cover the events.
As soon as the reporters know what to write about, they get down to work. They telephone people and fix a time for a face-to-face interview with them. Sometimes they do telephone interviews. Checking information is very important. They go to the newspaper's own library to look up any information that they need. This is called ""doing one's homework"".
At the same time, the picture editor decides which photographs will be used for the next day's paper. All the people who work on a newspaper must be able to work fast. Reporters have to stop working on one story and start working at once on the important new one. They must find out the new information as quickly as possible. Later in the day, everything is put together at the news desk. Reporters return, type their stories into the computer and hand them to the editor.
The chief editor decides which will be the most important story on the front page. Sometimes this will have to be changed if something more important happens late in the day. Other editors read the stories which the reporters have written and make any necessary changes.
Finally, there is no more time left for adding new stories, and the time for printing  the newspaper has come. This is done on fast-moving printing machines. The newspapers are then delivered  by truck, plane or rail. Speed is important. People want to buy the latest newspaper; nobody wants to buy yesterday's.

Context: As a group of young African immigrants struggle to adapt to life in the United States, an after-school drama program at White Oak Middle School aims to make their lives easier by first making them a little harder.
Project X is a program that uses drama, dance, poetry and other creative outlets to help students discuss the tough and sometimes painful problems they face as pre-teen immigrants with language barriers. A final unveiling of their creation will be performed for friends and family at the end of the year at Imagination Stage.
Wanjiru Kamau, coordinator of White Oak's African Club said it's important to give troubles to group members to help them find their place at the school. ""It comforts those who are uncomfortable, and it discomforts those who are comfortable,"" Kamau said of Project X.
Kamau teamed up with Imagination Stage after she noticed that many African students seemed uncomfortable talking about problems, such as being laughed at by their fellow students about how they look and talk. When most of the kids join the club, they speak little or no English, Kamau said. Each week, the club typically draws five to ten students who are originally from Africa for discussion sessions and the Project X programme.
""We are going to express ourselves through our words and our actions, and that's powerful,"" said teaching artist Meg Green as she introduced fill-in-the-blank poems the students wrote about their identities.
One student, Frank Ketchouang, 13, wrote, ""I am from the world; I am love,"" which drew oohs and aahs from the group. Ketchouang has been in the United States for less than a year, said Program Coordinator Chad Dike. When Ketchouang started attending Project X, he had been in the United States for two months and spoke no English. Now he's one of the group's most outgoing members and helps translate instructions from English to Creole for the group's newest member, who is from Haiti.
Many people will give up when there's a language barrier, ""but these students prove them wrong"". Kamau said. ""You do have something to give. You are important. When TV, media, etc. are bringing them down, this program is bringing them up."" 
 Question:The passage is written mainly to  _  . 
A. introduce the Project X program 
B. inspire immigrants to never give up

Context: I'm not so sure I like my friends any more. I used to like them-to be honest. We'd have lunch, talk on the phone or exchange emails, and they all seemed normal enough. But then came Face Book, and I was introduced to a sad fact: many of my friends have dark sides that they had kept from me.
Today my friends show off the more unpleasant aspects of their personalities via FaceBook. No longer hidden, they're thrown in my face like TV commercials -unavoidable and endless advertisements for the worst of their personalities.
Take Fred. If you were to have lunch with him, you'd find him warm, and self-effacing .Read his FaceBook and you'll realize he's an unbearable, food-obsessed boring man. He'd pause to have a cup of coffee on his way to save a drowning man-and then write about it.
Take Andy. You won't find a smarter CEO anywhere, but now he's a CEO without a company to run. So he plays Mafia Wars on FaceBook. He's doing well-level 731. Thanks to FaceBook, I know he's playing about 18 hours a day. Andy, you've run four companies-and this is how you spend your downtime? What happned to golf?What happened to getting another job?
Take Liz. She is positive that the flu vaccine will kill us all and that we should avoid it. And then comes Chris who likes to post at least 20 times a day on every website he can find, so I get to read his thoughts twice, once on FaceBook and once on Twitter.
In real life, I don't see these sides of people. Face to face, my friends show me their best. They're nice, smart people. But face to FaceBook, my friends is like a blind date which goes horribly wrong.
I'm left with a dilemma. Who is my real friend?Is it the Liz I have lunch with or the anti-vaccine madman on FaceBook? Is it the Fred I can grab a sandwich with or the Fred who weeps if he's at a party and the wine isn't up to his standard? 
 Question:According to the text, FaceBook tends to   _  . 
A. present another side of people 
B. offer some foods for free 
C. show endless advertisements

Context: When middle-aged Alex quit his job and made up his mind to become a self-employed writer, no one could tell for sure whether he would succeed or not.He found a cold storage room in a building, set up a used typewriter and settled down to work.
After a year or so, however, Alex began to doubt himself.He found it was difficult to earn his living by selling what he wrote.But Alex determined to put his dream to the test--even though it meant living with uncertainty and fear of failure.This is the shadowland   of hope, and anyone with a dream must learn to live there.

Finally his work was published in 1970.Instantly he had the kind of fame and success that few writers ever experience.The shadows had turned into focus of attention.
Then one day, Alex found a box filled with things he had owned years before.Inside was a paper bag with two cans and 18 cents.Suddenly he pictured himself working in that cold storage room.It reminds Alex, and anyone with a dream, of the courage and persistence   it takes to stay the course   in the shadowland.

Maxwell was a typist. His fingers danced on the keyboard. However, his people skills were not nearly as good as his typing skills. Sometimes his mouth got in the way of his employment.

His boss was still yelling as Maxwell walked out of the building. He felt great about telling off the boss. A few days later, the reality of not having a job hit home. He had to pay the rent and utility bills, and he had to eat. What was he going to do? 
He thought about apologizing and asking for his job back. But how would that look? Then again, who cares how it looks when you're almost broke? After thinking about it for another week, he finally called his boss and apologized. His boss accepted his apology, but said that he had already hired a replacement. 
Maxwell contacted a temporary job agency, which provided him enough occasional work to pay his bills. But none of the companies that he was sent to were hiring. So Maxwell was excited about finally getting an interview for a steady job. 
Maxwell's drive to the interview was disappointing. The traffic was  _ and the neighborhood looked rough. It took him 45 minutes to get there. The building was covered with graffiti.  
The interview started 30 minutes late. Not bothering to apologize, the manager lit a cigarette and took a sip from his coffee cup. He leaned back in his chair and put his feet up on his desk. He asked Maxwell a lot of questions. Maxwell thought that each question was stupider than the preceding question. The final question was, ""Where would you like to be 10 years from now?"" 
What does that have to do with typing? Maxwell wondered. Stupid questions from a rude man in a lousy neighborhood! Where would he like to be 10 years from now? 
""Anywhere but this dump!"" Maxwell said angrily, as he stood up and walked out. 
 Question:After the interview, we can infer that   _  . 
A. Maxwell will celebrate his big day. 
B. The manager will apologize to Maxwell. 
C. Maxwell will finally get this post. 
D. Maxwell will have to find another job interview.

Context: Impossible cases are not forever. While it is impossible for one person, it is possible for another. In a word, everything is possible.
Someone says, ""Success belongs to those who can look at the complex challenges offered by the world as inspiration."" So your challenges are golden opportunities for success. How can there be miracles if there are no obstacles? How will you chase the storm if there is no storm? You need challenges to reveal your ability. Success doesn't come out' of nothing; success comes from the problems you face. Those who refuse to give in
come out smiling.
Robert X. Perez says, ""The seeds of success spring from failure's ashes. ""Failure is not defeat; it is the pointer to do better than what you just did. You have to know that you are in a constant study of life. What you face is for your training. Samuel Aidoo says, ""Each failure is simply another chapter in the story of our lives. To fail is to understand what not to do. Remember it and don't give up until your goal is achieved.""
What do you do when you face difficulty? Yeah, life is difficult, but you do not give up.
Have a positive and calm outlook on your circumstances   and make the best of them. You may learn something new. You can develop mental toughness. Mental toughness means to be able to see the long-term gains rather than be put off by short-term pains. Once you have this toughness, you have the winning edge .
The only things in life you ever really regret are the chances you didn't take. You will regret when you see the consequences of not seizing the opportunities when they arose. Take chances every day! 
 Question:According to the author, success often comes to people who  _  . 
A. have good opportunities 
B. face failure 
C. don't fear difficulties 
D. have a lot of luck 
 Answer: C
Context: How many times do you have to fail at something in order to succeed? Did you know that Thomas Edison failed 10,000 times while trying to invent the light bulb? He certainly had a ""learn and do"" attitude! He was able to turn each failed experiment into a successful way to invent the light bulb. So what can we learn from this? You can adopt the ""fail forward"" strategy too.
In reality, none of us are failures. It's true that we will experience times of defeat, problems, and disasters, but remember, each one of us is meant to succeed in life. However, we must choose our fate. Henry David Thoreau said, ""Men are born to succeed, not to fail.""
We can never be forced into having a happy and successful life. Whether or not you experience success or failure is completely controlled by what you think and do. You are the only one who can choose the thoughts that will keep you from achieving the abundant life and joy that you are meant to have. No matter how difficult things may seem, say to yourself, ""I choose to be a happy and successful person.""
Why do some people get what they want and others fail? I believe that getting what you desire in life takes planning, and it doesn't just happen by luck. So how do we plan for success?
It has been proven that successful people do things more differently than unsuccessful people. They recognize the patterns of success and follow them; one of those patterns is planning. They plan what they think and do, which sets them apart. They know exactly what they desire, have an intelligent plan for getting it, and then work their plan. They know what success will cost them in terms of time, energy, and results, and they devote the right resources toward making their plans happen. 
 Question:What Henry David Thoreau said implies that   _  . 
A. everyone is able to be a success 
B. most people lack the confidence to succeed 
C. everyone can do nothing but succeed in his life 
D. no one can succeed without difficulty and suffering

Context: I was never neat, while my roommate Kate was extremely organized. Each of her projects had its place, but mine always hid somewhere. She even labeled everything. I always looked for everything. Over time, Kate got neater and I got messier. She would push my dirty clothing over, and I would lay my books on her tidy desk. We both get tired of each other.
War broke out one evening. Kate came into the room. Soon, I heard her screaming, "" take your shoes away! Why under my bed!"" Deafened, I saw my shoes flying at me. I jumped to my feet and started yelling. She yelled back louder.
The room was filled with anger. We could not have stayed together for a single minute but for a phone call. Kate answered it. From her end of the conversation, I could tell right away her grandma was seriously ill. When she hung up, she quickly crawled under her covers, sobbing. Obviously, that was something she should not go through alone. All of a sudden, a warm feeling of sympathy rose up in my heart.

She was watching, her tears dried and her expression one of disbelief. Then, she reached out her hands to grasp mine. I looked up into her eyes. She smiled at me, ""thanks.""

Context: On a cool November afternoon in Fleming Island, Florida, Melissa Hawkinson, 41, was driving her five-year-old twins home from school when she saw a sudden splash in Doctors Lake just ahead. What was that? She thought. As she drove up to the scene, she saw a half-submerged car sinking about 30 yards offshore. ""It was going down pretty quickly,"" Hawkinson recalls. She stopped the car near the boat ramp and ran toward the water. Water is going to be cold, she thought.
She took off her vest and leather boots, got into the icy water, and swam to the car, where she found Cameron Dorsey, five, trapped into his car as the swirling water rose around him.
Hawkinson tried to open the door, but it was locked. So she pushed and pulled hard on the partially open window until she could reach through and unlock the door. She pulled the boy free, swam to shore, and handed him off to onlookers who were only watching them on a dock. The driver, the boy's suicidal father, swam back to land on his own. Afterward, Hawkinson sat on the shore wrapped in a blanket. ""For ten or 15 minutes, I couldn't stop shaking,"" she said.
There's nothing visibly extraordinary about Melissa Hawkinson, an energetic stay-at-home mom with brown hair and a sweet smile. Yet something made her different from the dockside onlookers that day. Why do some people act quickly, willing to take a risk for a stranger? What makes them run toward danger rather than away from it? Hawkinson, the Granite Mountain Hotshots (,)---19 of whom lost their life this past summer in Arizona--- every hero who puts his or her life on the line to save another: what makes them brave?
Moreover, can bravery be learned, or is it a quality with which you are born? The answer is complex. Bravery taps the mind, brain and heart. It comes from instinct, training and sympathy. Today, neurologists, psychologists and other researchers are studying bravery, trying to uncover the mystery. 
 Question:What is the writer's purpose of writing this passage? 
A. To set us thinking what makes people brave. 
B. To call on us to learn from such people as Hawkinson. 
C. To remind people of risk while saving others. 
D. To show people bravery can be learned.

Context: Teenager Jake Deham was skiing with his family in the US when he fell over and lost one of his skis. His family didn't know that he had a problem. They kept on skiing. When they got to the foot of the mountain, there was no sign of Jake.
Jake couldn't find his ski anywhere. In the end, he decided to take off his other ski and walk down the mountain. But he couldn't work out the right way to go.
It was now getting dark and he was a long way from any place of safety. He knew that he might die that night in the cold temperatures. But Jake kept calm. At home, Jake watched a lot of programmes about living in difficult situations. He remembered the advice from these programmes and knew that he should build a hole in the snow. He made a hole so the wind couldn't blow into it. Outside his hole, the temperature fell to a dangerous -15degC that night, but inside it Jake was safe from the cold.
After the long evening passed, Jake began to think his way out. He had to get down the mountain. The TV programmes always said, ""If you are lost, you should find someone else's tracks  through the snow and follow them."" ""I wanted to live my life."" remembered Jake, ""So I got up and I found some ski tracks and I followed those."" He walked and walked and finally saw lights...
His mum was very happy when she heard her son was saved. Amazingly, Jake didn't even have to go to hospital. He got through the terrible experience without any injuries.
So, the next time someone says that watching TV is a waste of time, think of Jake. Sometimes TV can save your life!

Context: Wide awake in Aunt Bet's Southern house, Annie Van Lew shivered at the sounds of distant guns. It was bad enough that America was at war, but the young Virginia girl was not used to battles being fought this close.  _ .Annie sat up in bed and listened.Had a stranger broken in? Earlier, the family had heard that captured officers recently escaped from a prison nearby.
   Quietly opening her bedroom door, Annie walked out. A figure in a black gown was walking down the hall. It was Aunt Bet, carrying a candle in one hand and a plate of fried chicken in the other.

That night, Annie learned Aunt Bet was one of many daring Southerners whose hatred  of slavery drove them to risk their lives by spying for the North. The girl chatted as she dared, wishing her new friend luck when he said he would leave at dawn.

Context: Around six weeks ago, Kaileen came running into the house, just getting off the bus from school. She was all excited about a story about homeless pets because of Hurricane   Katrina and all that was going on to help them. She said that this information came from her animal newspaper (your KIND News). Kaileen has a great love and compassion   for animals, so her excitement did not surprise me. Her next ideas, however, did. She said that we should go around right then to our neighbors and collect all their change to send to the animal shelters  .
         I thought this was a school project, but in fact, it was not. This was what Kaileen wanted to do on her own! Well, it warmed me all over. To see your child so willing to help others just lets you feel that maybe you had done something right in raising   her. 
         Anyway, I told her to make a card and send it out to our neighbors first. With the help of her older brother, Kaileen soon made a lovely card that asked our neighbors to help these pets by giving their spare change. She gave them a few days and a date she would come by to pick up any donations  .  
         Well, I had to go out and buy a donation box. Kaileen collected $279.50!!! I just thought you would like to know how KIND News had touched a little one's heart and given her the idea to show her compassion for animals. Thank you -- we really enjoy your paper. 
 Question:From the passage we learn that KIND News   _  . 
A. collects donations for homeless people 
B. sets up many shelters for homeless animals 
C. tells children how to keep pets healthy 
D. encourages children to help homeless pets

Context: As a child, I was really afraid of the dark and of getting lost. These fears were very real and caused me some uncomfortable moments.
Maybe it was the strange way things looked and sounded in my own room at night that scared me so much. There was never complete darkness, but always a streetlight or passing car lights, which made clothes on the back of a chair take on the shape of a wild animal. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the curtains seem to move when there was no wind. A very low sound in the floor would seem a hundred times louder than in the day. My imagination   would run wild, and my heart would beat fast. I would lie very still so that the ""enemy"" would not discover me.
Another of my childhood fears was that I would get lost, especially on the way home from school. Every morning I got on the school bus right near my home. That was no problem. After school, though, when all the buses were lined up along the street, I was afraid that I would get in the wrong one and be taken to some other strange places. On school or family trips to a park or a museum, I wouldn't let the leaders out of my sight.
Perhaps one of the worst fears of all I had as a child was that of not being liked or accepted by others. Being popular was so important to me then, and the fear of not  being liked was a serious one.
One of the processes growing up is being able to realize and overcome our fears. Understanding the things that scared us as children helps us achieve greater success later in life. 
 Question:When she went to some other places, she would   _  . 
A. walk away without others 
B. follow others closely 
C. take a bus by herself 
D. make sure not to take a wrong bus

Context: When we think of leadership, we often think of strength and power. But what are these really, and how do they operate?
Leadership today is not about forcing others to do things. If this is even possible, it is short-term, and tends to backfire. If you order someone to do something against their will, they may do it because they feel they must, but the anger they feel will do more harm in the long-term, They will also experience fear.
Fear causes the thinking brain to shut down, making the person unable to function at his or her best. If they associate you with this emotion of fear. They will become less functional around you, and you will have succeeded in not only shooting yourself in the foot, but possibly making a very good employee or partner unable to perform effectively. Fear has no place in leadership.
The way we influence people in a lasting way is by our own character, and our understanding and use of emotion. We can order someone to do something, which may be part of the work day; or we can employ them at the emotional level, so they became fully devoted to the projects and provide some of their own motivation  . Today's work place is all about relationships.
Anyone works harder in a positive environment in which they are recognized and valued as a human being as well as a worker. Everyone produces just a bit more for someone they like. Leaders understand the way things work. They know the pay check is not the single most motivating factor   in the work life of most people.
The true strength of leadership is an inner strength that comes from the confidence of emotional intelligence--knowing your own emotions, and how to handle them, and those of others. Developing your emotional intelligence is the single best thing you can do if you want to develop your relationships with people around you, which is the key to the leadership skills. 
 Question:An employee may have a feeling of fear in the work place when   _  . 
A. he is forced to do thing 
B. he cannot work at his best 
C. he feels his brain shut down 
D. he thinks of his work as too heavy 
 Answer: A
Context: No one gets through life without experiencing many disappointments. Strangely, though, most people seem unprepared for disappointment and react to it in negative ways. They feel depressed or try to escape from their troubles instead of using disappointment as an opportunity for growth.
One negative reaction to disappointment is depression. A woman trying to win a promotion, for example, works hard for over a year in her department. Helen is so sure she will get the promotion. However, the boss names one of Helen's co-workers for the spot. Deeply depressed, Helen loses her enthusiasm for her job and can barely force herself to show up every day. Helen tells herself that she is a failure and that doing a good job just isn't worth the work.
Another negative reaction to disappointment is the desire to escape. Kevin fails to get into the college his brother is attending, the college that was the focus of all his dreams, and decides to escape his disappointment. Why worry about college at all? Instead, he covers up his real feelings by giving up on his school-work and getting completely involved with friends, parties, and ""good times"".
The positive way to react to disappointment is to use it as a chance for growth. This isn't easy, but it's the only useful way to deal with an inevitable part of life. Helen, the woman who was not promoted, could have handled her disappointment by looking at other options. If her boss did not recognize her talent and hard work, perhaps she could transfer to another department. Or she could ask the boss how to improve her performance so that she could prepare for the next promotion. Kevin, the boy who didn't get into the college of his choice, should look into other schools. Going to another college may encourage him to be his own person, step out of his brother's shadow, and realize that being turned down by one college isn't a final judgment on his abilities or potential.
Disappointments are unwelcome, but regular visitors to everyone's life. We can feel depressed about them or we can try to escape from them. The best thing, though, is to accept a disappointment and then try to use it somehow: Step over the unwelcome visitor on the doorstep and get on with life.

Context: A month went by in this manner , but a month was all I could bear .
The memory of Marguerite accompanied me wherever I went . I had loved that woman --- still loved her --- too much for her suddenly to mean nothing to me . Whatever feelings I might have for her now , I had to see her again . At once .
...
I knew Marguerite . Meeting me so unexpectedly must have thrown her into a state of great confusion . Probably , she had heard of my departure which had set her mind at rest as to the consequences of our sudden parting . But , seeing me back and coming face to face with me , pale as I was , she had sensed that my return had a purpose , and must have wondered what was going to happen .
If , when I saw her again , Marguerite had been unhappy ; if , in taking my revenge  , there had also been some way of helping her , then I might well have forgiven her , and would certainly never have dreamed of doing her any harm . But when I saw her again , she was happy , at least on the surface . Another man had ensured her the luxury  in which I had been unable to keep her . She brought shame both to my pride and my love ; she was going to have to pay for what I had suffered .
I could not remain indifferent  to what she did now . It followed that the thing that would hurt her most would be exactly for me to show indifference . Indifference , therefore , was the feeling which I now needed to pretend , not only in her presence but in the eyes of others .
I tried to put a smile on my face , and I went to call on Prudence with whom Marguerite was staying .
Prudence saw me to the door , and I returned to my apartment with tears of anger in my eyes and thirst for revenge in my heart and thought only of finding a way to make the poor creature suffer . 
 Question:What kind of feelings did the hero most probably have ? 
A. Indifference and love . 
B. Indifference and hate . 
C. Love and hate . 
D. Hate and sadness .

Context: Few people would disagree that email makes our lives easier. But misusing email can cause problems. And I'm not talking about hitting the ""reply all"" button when you didn't mean to.
Answering all those emails and processing all that information can overload the brain,causing stress.
So says the Future Work Centre, a business based in London.This company carries out psychological research on people's experiences in their workplaces.
The centre's Richard MacKinnon was the lead writer of a report on messaging habits. He calls email a double-edged sword. In other works,email can be both good and bad. Americans also use the saying cuts both ways for something like a double-edged sword.
But back to the culture of emailing,Emails provide a useful way to communicate. But they could add to tension in the mind,causing stress. Come rain or shine, some office workers are under pressure to read and answer emails all day long.
Jonathan Rowe has on office job in London. His complaint is a common one:too many emails.
He says reading work emails when you're at home blurs the boundaries between work and leisure.
Psychologists are concemed about the pressure that workers bring on themselves. Dr. Richard MacKinnon spoke with VOA News on Skype.
He says that email can be a valuable, time-saving communication tool. But it can also be a  source of stress and even anger for many of us. He adds that the stress does not come from the number of emails you get. The problems result from when and how you deal with them.
According to the study,there are two very stressful email behaviors. One is leaving email on all day-and never signing off. The other is reading and answering emails early in the day and late at night.
Which jobs are most affected by email stress?
But not all jobs are equally stressed by email. The jobs most affected by email stress are:
* marketing,
* public relations,
* media and
* Information Technology
Educational experts have also written several reports on how email overloads are stressing out teachers.
Ways to cut down on your email stress
MacKinnon says bad email behaviors are linked to higher levels of stress in office workers. The Future Work Centre report gives several suggestions on avoiding email stress.
*Use email with a plan. Do not just react to endless email alerts. If you use an email application, or app ,on your device, close it down when you want to be left alone.
*If you need to communicate with a co-worker,call or better still walk to their office and talk about it.
*Be careful with the ""reply all"" option. For example, if you are accepting an invitation to attend training, just write back to those who need to know. Trust me. Other workers on that mailing list will thank you.
*And accept the fact that if a matter is urgent employers will call you about it.
The Future Work Centre report claims that in 2014, people sent an estimated 196.3 billion emails. The average adult spent more than an hour a day answering emails.
Email is certainly not going anywhere. So, it is important to control your emails and not the other way around. 
 Question:Dr.Richard MacKinnon holds the idea that  _  . 
A. it is the emails you get daily that puts you under pressure. 
B. it is the way of processing emails that makes you feel stressed. 
C. it is necessary that you read and answer your emails at noon. 
D. it is important that you realize where a source of stress comes from. 
 Answer: B
Context: Email has brought the art of letter writing back to life, but some experts think the resulting spread of bad English does more harm than good.
Email is a form of communication that is changing, for the worse, the way we write and use language, say some communication researchers. It is also changing the way we interact  and build relationship. These are a few of the recently recognized features of email, say experts, which should cause individuals and organizations to rethink the way they use email.
""Email has increased the spread of careless writing habits,"" says Naomi Baron, a professor of linguistics  at an American university. She says the poor spelling, grammar, punctuation and sentence structure of emails reflect  a growing unconcern about the way we write.
Baron argues that we shouldn't forgive and forget the poor writing often shown in email. ""The more we use email and its tasteless writing, the more it becomes the normal way of writing,"" the professor says.
Others say that despite its poor writing, email has finished what several generations of English teachers couldn't: it has made writing fashionable again.
""Email is a critical new communication technology."" says Ian Lancashire, a professor of English at Toronto University. ""It fills the gap between spoken language and the formal methods of writing that existed before email. It is the purest form of written speech.""
Lancashire says email has the mysterious ability to get people who are usually scared by writing to get their thoughts flowing easily onto a blank screen. He says this is because of email's close similarity to speech. ""It's like a circle of four or five people around a campfire,"" he says.
Still, he accepts that this new-found freedom to express themselves often gets people into trouble. Emails sent in a day almost exceed  the number of letters mailed in a year. But more people are recognizing the content of a typical email message is not often exact. 
 Question:In Lancashire's opinion, email is a wonderful technology because   _  . 
A. it can be useful all over the world 
B. it is the fastest way to communicate 
C. we can express ourselves in a free way 
D. we can save a lot of paper

Context: Mr. Grey was the manager of a small office in London. He lived in the country, and went to work by train. He liked walking from the station to his office if it wasn't raining, because it gave him some exercise.

Context: In 1971, a young man who grew up very poor was traveling across the country, trying to make a new start for himself. Along the way he had completely run out of money and was forced to spend the night in his car. This continued until one morning, after a week of sleeping in his car, he walked nervously into a restaurant and ordered a big breakfast.
After eating his first good meal in weeks, he lied to the waiter, telling him he had lost his wallet. This waiter, who was also the owner of the restaurant, walked behind the chair where the young man had been sitting. He bent down, and came up with a $20 bill that looked as if it had fallen on the floor and said, ""You must have dropped this,"" the owner said. The young man couldn't believe his luck. He quickly paid for the breakfast, left a tip, bought gas with the money, and went to the West.
On the way out of town, he began to understand what that man did. Maybe nobody dropped the money. ""Maybe that man knew I was in trouble and he helped me in a way that didn't hurt me. So I just made a promise to help other people if I can.""
Later, he worked very hard and became a rich man. Now, he lives in Kansas City. Each year he gives away thousands of dollars. He is known as the ""Secret Santa "" because at Christmas time each year, he personally hands money out to those on the street and at restaurants. 
 Question:From this text we can know that_.

Context: Jimmy is an automotive mechanic, but he lost his job a few months ago. He has a good heart, but always feared applying for a new job.
One day, he gathered up all his strength and decided to attend a job interview. His appointment was at 10 am and it was already 8:30. While waiting for a bus to the office where he was supposed to be interviewed, he saw an elderly man wildly kicking the tyre of his car. Obviously there was something wrong with the car. Jimmy immediately went up to lend him a hand. When Jimmy finished working on the car, the old man asked him how much he should pay for the service. Jimmy said there was no need to pay him; he just helped someone in need, and he had to rush for an interview. Then the old man said, ""Well, I could take you to the office for your interview. It's the least I could do. Please, I insist."" Jimmy agreed.
Upon arrival, Jimmy found a long line of applicants waiting to be interviewed. Jimmy still had some grease on him after the car repair, but he did not have much time to wash it off or have a change of shirt. One by one, the applicants left the interviewer's office with disappointed look on their faces. Finally his name was called. The interviewer was sitting on a large chair facing the office window. Rocking the chair back and forth, he asked, ""Do you really need to be interviewed?"" Jimmy's heart sank. ""With the way I look now, how could I possibly pass this interview?"" he thought to himself.
Then the interviewer turned the chair and to Jimmy's surprise, it was the old man he helped earlier in the morning. It turned out he was the General Manager of the company.
""Sorry I had to keep you waiting, but I was pretty sure I made the right decision to have you as part of our workforce before you even stepped into the office. I just know you'd be a trustworthy worker. Congratulations!"" Jimmy sat down and they shared a cup of well-deserved coffee as he landed himself a new job. 
 Question:Why did the old man offer Jimmy a ride? 
A. He was also to be interviewed 
B. He needed a traveling companion 
C. He always helped people in need 
D. He was thankful to Jimmy

Context: You probably remember me from the other day. I was the one who reacted very slowly to the green traffic light. When you honked your horn ,I realized I was holding up traffic, so please accept my apology. However, I do want you to know why I seemed in a confused state. You see, I was just at the doctor's office getting the results of the examination I had two weeks ago, and I was wondering how I would tell my husband and children that I had cancer. There were still tears in my eyes, so,quite simply I didn't even see the lights change. Perhaps I should not have been driving, but I didn't want to miss my appointment.
I was in the express lane at the supermarket without thinking and moving. Please accept my apology. My mind was on my youngest daughter who ran away from home, and she?'just sixteen. I was so worried then. You see, she somehow got in with the wrong crowd and started using drugs and drinking. I was remembering what a pretty little girl she had been most of her life. I know you were unhappy along with others in line. Please, accept my apology.
I remember you from the store last week. I was so mean to you, when you were doing your job to the best of your ability. I acted so childishly. Please accept my apology. You see, I arrived home from work just yesterday and discovered that my wife had left me, but I should never have taken it out on you. Please, accept my apology.
The above are imagined incidents, and yet they expressed a very real truth. The old saying about judging others before you ""have walked a mile in their shoes"" is a much needed reminder. Perhaps we all could try to learn the fact that there are problems and situation in the lives of others which we are totally unaware of. So, maybe before we get angry in similar situations, we should think a moment and understand that things may be going on in other's lives which have caused them to be slower, absent-minded or angry. Patience, as they say, is a virtue. 
 Question:What does the author mainly want to express? 
A. Learn to accept others?apology. 
B. We need more patience and understanding. 
C. Be patient when you are in line. 
D. The patient should not drive to the office.

Context: Sherlock Holmes was the greatest detective in history. His astonishing power of observation and analysis meant that he was able to solve cases which left the real police completely
. As a problem solver in the law forced business, he was a knowledgeable person equal to Superman, the comic book hero.
Like Superman, of course, Holmes did not exist. He was the creation of a Scottish doctor and novelist Arthur Conan Doyle, and remains one of the most famous literary fiction characters of all time.
Holmes' general rule when trying to solve a case was as follows: completely get rid of the impossible. Then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
It's said that Holmes' powers of deduction   were superhuman, particularly his ability to process information from what he observed. In a story called The Boscombe Valley Mystery, Holmes examines the area near a lake where a murder has been committed. The local police have already searched the area and found no clues. Holmes spends ten minutes in the area, and announces that the murderer ""is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting boots and a gray coat, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar holder, and carries a penknife in his pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search."" Needless to say, he has found evidence to support all of these statements.
The fictional Holmes lived in an apartment at 221 Baker Street, a real street in Central London. When Conan Doyle wrote about Holmes, there was no 221 Baker Street, but after the street was extended northwards, there was. There is currently a bank at that address.
The fact that Holmes didn't actually exist doesn't stop thousands of people writing to him for help every year.The bank kindly responds to every letter they receive with the following message: ""Mr. Holmes thanks you for your letter. At the moment he is retired in Sussex, keeping bees, and does not undertake detective work nowadays."" 
 Question:When letters are written to Holmes,    _ 
A. he answers letters when he receives them 
B. his secretary answers them for him. 
C. the bank at 221 Baker Street where he used to live sends the letters back 
D. the bank at his address replies that Holmes is no longer working as a detective 
 Answer: D
Context: Stop wasting your time thinking of reasons for your failures.  Instead, realize that the seeds of success were planted within you when you were born. Only you have the power to make those seeds grow.
The seeds, and the power to grow them, are contained in the most awesome machine ever created: the human mind. Success is a choice and not a chance. You were born a winner. You were born rich. You can be a success if only you make the right choice.
You cannot be successful without first developing your self-confidence. Your level of self-confidence is always based on the degree of control that you are able to exercise over yourself, and thus over your life. People with low self-confidence are people who do not believe that they have any power, or responsibility for their lives. They are always victims. They are leaves tossed   by the winds of chance blown about with any sudden change in the weather.
You can exercise control over your life only to the degree that you believe you are responsible for everything that happens in your life.  Failures think that everything happens by accident and chance. Successful people realize that they are responsible.
Everything happens as a result of something.  If we can identify  the cause, we can control the effect. We are responsible for what we choose to think and believe. One generally rises to the level that one expects. We are responsible for setting our expectations. Our success is dependent upon our level of confidence.
In all areas of your life, whether they are financial, physical, or spiritual, you are responsible. Once you recognize this, accept it, and firmly believe it. You are on the road to success. 
 Question:People with low self-confidence are compared to leaves because they  _  . 
A. don't have the power to face their lives 
B. are ready to change their minds 
C. can't exercise control over themselves 
D. are easily affected by windy weather

Context: Is it possible to persuade mankind to live without war? War is an ancient custom which has existed for at least six thousand years. It was always evil and usually foolish, but in the past the human race managed to live with it. Modern skill has changed this. Either man will stop war, or war will stop man. For the present, it is nuclear weapons that cause the greatest danger, but bacteriological(  ) or chemical weapons may, before long, offer an even greater threat. If we succeeded in stopping war, there would be no danger for us. To do this, we need to persuade mankind to look upon international questions in a new way, not by contests of force, in which the victory goes to the side which is most skillful in massacre ( ),but by judging in accordance with agreed rules of law. It is not easy to change old mental habits, but this is what must be attempted.
There are those who say that the adoption of this or that ideology  would prevent war. I believe this to be a complete error. All ideologies are based upon beliefs without proof which are, at best, doubtful, and at worst, totally false. Those people who believe them are willing to go to war in support of them.
The movement of world opinion during the past two years has changed very largely such as we can welcome. It has become a common belief that nuclear war must be avoided. Of course, very difficult problems remain in the international world, but the spirit in which they are being approached is a better one than it was some years ago. It has begun to be thought, even by the powerful men who decide whether we shall live or die, that agreements should be reached even if both sides do not find these agreements wholly satisfactory. It has begun to be understood that the important conflict nowadays is not between East and West, but between Man and the bomb. 
 Question:The author believes that the only way to stop war is to  _  . 
A. take possession of stronger weapons 
B. let the stronger side take over the world 
C. settle international issues through agreements 
D. destroy bacteriological and chemical weapons 
 Answer: C
Context: Barack Obama has never been shy about comparing himself with Abraham Lincoln. He did so when he announced his presidential election in Illinois, where both he and Lincoln served in the legislature  . ""The life of a tall, thin, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible."" Obama said. ""He tells us that there is power in words and that there is power in hope."" Such comparisons have continued on big and small occasions, but the most important similarity, in Obama's mind, is how he plans to govern if elected.
Obama says he admires Doris Kearns Goodwin' s wonderful Lincoln biography, Team of Rivals. ""He talks about it all the time."" says a top assistant. ""He is particularly interested in the idea that Lincoln successfully won the hearts of many people who had run against him for President, some of them even disagree with him firmly."" ""The lesson is that you shouldn't let your hatred   get in the way of hiring  ly the best people."" says Obama. ""I think American people are practical and so I have an interest in casting a wide net, seeking out people with a wide range of expert knowledge, including Republicans, for the highest positions in the government.""
""I don't want to have people who just agree with me."" He says. ""I want people who are continually pushing me forward and I'd be very interested in having those sorts of Republicans in my government, especially people who can speed up a responsible and logical conclusion to the Iraq war."" 
 Question:What can we infer from the passage? 
A. Obama is a member of the Republicans. 
B. The passage was written after the presidential election. 
C. Doris Goodwin is one of Obama's assistants. 
D. In the end Lincoln was able to get the support of the people who once hated him.

Context: Whenever the word ""hero"" comes to me, I immediately think of three Hs: honorable, hardworking, and happy. When I think more about this word, I picture someone who has accomplished good things for people and tries to do the right thing Hattie Elizabeth Alexander is one person whom I find to be very heroic.
Hattie was born in Baltimore, Maryland on April 5, 1901. During her time at College she earned her Bachelor's Degree in Bacteriology and Physiology. These were just the first steps towards what she was finally going to be remembered for. After college Hattie attended Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and received her medical degree.
After her education, she pursued her career, and after much time and hard work, she _ reduced the number of infants  dying from meningitis . Hattie was very dedicated to her work and helped at as many locations as she could. Spending substantial  time in the laboratory, Hattie successfully developed a cure against the disease, which decreased the death rate to 20 percent. At the same time, she was also a teacher working with Columbia University.
She was a caring lady interested in other people's lives. When she was teaching at Columbia University, other members would talk to her about students that were failing their classes, and somehow Hattie could always find convincing reasons as to why they should not be driven away. Later, Hattie became an instructor in Pediatrics at New York City's Babies Hospital. After many honors, she became the first woman president of the American Pediatric Society in 1965. This was her last major achievement, for soon after, Hattie died of cancer on June 24, 1968.
Hattie is my hero because her positive attitude and strength helped her accomplish great things for others. She gave them her strength by developing medicines against diseased, which, by doing so, made them stronger. This is what makes Hattie Elizabeth Alexander my hero. 
 Question:Hattie is considered to be a hero by the author in that   _  . 
A. she was an honorable, hardworking and happy person 
B. she was a very dedicated woman doctor with many honors 
C. she was a caring lady who helped many students finish college

Context: Anxiety is the appropriate emotion when the immediate personal terror--of a volcano, an arrow, a stab in the back and other disasters, all directed against one's self--disappears.
The kind of world that produces anxiety is actually a world of   safety, a world in which no one feels that he himself is facing sudden death. The anxiety exists as an uneasy state of mind, in which one has a feeling that something unspecified and indeterminable may go wrong. If the world seems to be going well, this produces anxiety--for good times may end.If the world is going badly--it may get worse. Anxiety tends to be without focus; the anxious person doesn't know whether to blame himself or other people. He isn't sure whether it is the current year of the administration or a change in climate or the atom bomb that is to blame for this undefined sense of unease.
It is clear that we have developed a society which depends on having the right amount of anxiety to make it work...While we agree that too much anxiety is harmful to mental health, we have come to rely on anxiety to push us into seeing a doctor about a symptom which may indicate cancer, into checking up on that old life-insurance policy which may have out-of-date provisions in it, into having a conference with Billy's teacher even though his report card looks all right.
People who are anxious enough keep their car insurance up, have the brakes checked, don't take a second drink when they have to drive. People who are too anxious either refuse to go into cars at all--and so complicate the ordinary course of life--or drive so tensely and carefully that they help cause accidents. People who aren't anxious enough take chance after chance, which increases the terrible accidents of the roads. 
 Question:According to the author, accidents of the road tend to be caused by_. 
A. all those who are too anxious 
B. all those who have anxiety 
C. those who have no anxiety 
D. those who are not anxious enough 
 Answer: D
Context: In a cab, a woman seemed in such a hurry. She constantly rushed the cab driver to drive quickly. She was so absorbed in her own thoughts of getting to the airport as soon as possible that she was not aware they were going by a different route.
All of a sudden, a young man got inside the cab. He took her handbag in which she had put her visa, passport, and all the money for the trip.
The cab driver, who was _ the robber, left her in the exactly middle of a dark street. She thought that she was rather unfortunate in the very situation.
During the very night, she was told a piece of shocking news. Tears came down her cheek. Flight 360, the plane that she should have got on board, had crashed. Had she not lost her important belongings, she could surely have lost the thing far more precious----her life.
Sometimes bad things really happen. There are times when nothing seems to go our way. So what should we do about it? We must get rid of all these frustrations and start all over again in the faith that we will get what we deserve.
Don't waste your time and energy on things that can't be changed. Continuous worrying will only affect your health and you'll be doing much more damage than what was previously done.
What if it was the other way round? What if we never ran out of good luck?
There was a man who won the lottery. He became greedy and wasted all his money on everything he could get his hands on.
But when he one day made it to the front page of the newspaper again, it was a different story. He had been killed because of his riches. If you attain good luck, you can never be too secure about it. Life is so unpredictable. You never know what will happen next.
Live one day at a time. We sometimes subject ourselves to unnecessary emotional trouble. But please don't forget: sometimes misfortune can be the source of happiness. Live for the moment. Do what must be done for the present and the future will turn out just fine. Believe me. And believe in yourself. As Captain Planet always says, ""The power is yours!"" 
 Question:From the passage, we learn that   _  . 
A. robbers are sure to get what they want 
B. somebody never runs out of good luck 
C. the woman was lucky to miss her flight 
D. if one feels oneself lucky, he or she will continue to be so

Context: We are all called upon to make a speech at some point in life, but most of us don't do a very good job. This article gives some suggestions on how to give an effective speech.
So, you have to give a speech and you're fearful. You get nervous, you forget what you want to say, you stumble over  words, you talk too long and you bore your audience. Later you think,"" Thank goodness, it's over. I'm just no good at public speaking. I hope I never have to do that again.""
Cheer up! It doesn't have to be that bad. Here are some simple steps to take the pain out of speech making. Ask yourself the purpose of your speech. What is the occasion ? Why are you speaking? Then, gather as many facts as you can on your subject. Spend plenty of time doing your research. Then spend plenty of time organizing your material so that your speech is clear and easy to follow. Use as many examples as possible and use pictures, charts and graphs if they will help you make your points more clearly. Never forget your audience. Don't talk over their heads so that they can understand what you say. They will appreciate your thoughtfulness.
Just remember: Be prepared. Know your subject, your audience and the occasion. Be brief. Say what you have to say and then stop. And be yourself. Let your personality come through so that you make person-to-person contact with your audience.
If you follow these simple steps, you'll see that you don't have to be afraid of public speaking. In fact, you may find the experience so enjoyable that you volunteer to make more speeches! You're not sure yet. Give it a try and see what happens.

Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""
It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on. 
 Question:What can we learn from this passage? 
A. Jordan is not such a great person. 
B. Jordan deserves the admiration he had from others. 
C. Jordan is always ready to make friends with young people. 
D. Jordan is always misunderstood by expert reviewers.

Context: After eleven years of marriage, a couple had a boy. They were a loving couple and the boy was a gem of their eyes.
When the boy was around two years old, one morning the husband saw a medicine bottle open. He was late for work, so he asked his wife to cap the bottle and keep it in the cupboard. His wife who was busy in the kitchen forgot the matter.
The boy saw the bottle, playfully went to it, was fascinated by its color and drank it all. It happened to be a poisonous  medicine. When the child fell to the ground, the mother took him to the hospital in a hurry, where he died. The mother was stunned. She was terrified at how to face her husband.
When the father came to the hospital and saw the dead child, he looked at his wife and just said, ""I'm with you, darling.""
The child is dead. He can never be brought back to life. There is no point in finding fault with the mother. Besides, if only he had taken time to keep the bottle away, this would not have happened. No one is to blame . She had also lost her only child. What she needed at that moment was consolation  and sympathy  from the husband. That is exactly what he gave her. 
 Question:How did the boy die? 
A. He fell downstairs by accident. 
B. He took some poisonous medicine by accident. 
C. He had a heart disease. 
D. He ate too much candy. 
 Answer: B
Context: In the famous fairy tale, Snow White eats the Queen's apple and falls victim to a curse; in Shakespeare's novel, Romeo drinks the poison and dies; some ancient Chinese kings took pills that contained mercury, believing that it would make them _ , but they died afterwards.
Poison has long been an important part in literature and history, and it seems to always be about evil, danger and death. But how much do you really know about poison?
An exhibition, The Power of Poison, opened last month at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, intended to give the audience a more vivid understanding of poison. The exhibition will continue until Feb. 2016, reported The New York Times.
The museum tour starts in a rainforest setting, where you can see live examples of some of the most poisonous animals: caterpillars, frogs and spiders. Golden poison frogs, for instance, aren't much bigger than a coin, but their skin is covered in a poison that can cut off the signaling power of your nerves, and a single frog has enough venom to kill 10 grown humans.
The exhibition also features interactive activities. In an iPad-based game, visitors are presented with three puzzling illnesses and asked to identify the poisons based on symptoms. In one case, for example, a pet dog is found sick in a backyard and visitors have to figure out whether it was the toad  , the leaky batteries in the trash or the dirty pond water that did it.
""Poisons can be bad for some things,"" Michael Novacek, senior vice president of the museum, told NBC News. ""Yet they can also be good for others.""
This is what visitors learn from the last part of the exhibition, which displays how poisons can be used favorably by humans, including for medical treatment.
The blood toxins of vampire bats, for example, can prevent blood from clotting  , which may protect against strokes. A poisonous chemical found in the yew tree is effective against cancer, which is what led to the invention of a cancer-fighting drug called Taxol. One chemical in the venom of Gila monsters can lower the blood sugar of its victims, so it has been used to treat diabetes.

Context: Many cities in the world are benefiting from the night activities of a group of people who call themselves guerrilla   gardeners. Armed with trowels, spades and a van full of flowers and plants, guerrilla gardeners turn abandoned urban land into a blaze of color. In city centre locations where there was mud, weeds and empty plastic bottles, residents often wake up to find that the wasted area has been transformed overnight with brightly-colored bedding plants.
In most British cities, local governments and police turn a blind eye to the effort of the gardeners, whose activities are always carried out under cover of nightfall. And so far, there has been nothing but praise from the astonished and delighted local residents when they find their neighborhood transformed in such a striking fashion.
Not only do the guerrilla gardeners beautify neglected places, they also return regularly to water the plants and weed the flower beds. They also make sure that at least some of the plants they bring are evergreens, which means that the area doesn't look depressing in the winter months.
The first guerrilla gardener in London was Richard Reynolds, whose day job is at an advertising agency. Mr. Reynolds, a graduate of Oxford University, began his efforts two years ago when he moved to a flat in a tower block in South London. From his balcony, he could see several empty concrete pots, placed by the local governments to contain plants but never used. He went out after midnight and filled the pots with plants, and then planted more flowers in the path leading to the entrance to the block.
He then set up a website to explain his plan and called upon more gardeners to join him. Cash donations flooded in and, more importantly, volunteers rushed to be part of the campaign. Within six months, there were five hundred people in London prepared to come out at very short notice to restore neglected parts of the urban landscape. There are now unofficial but carefully-organized groups in many cities in Britain and North America and there is also a website where would-be urban gardeners can find out the location of the next expedition. 
 Question:Richard Reynolds decided to fill the pots with plants in order to   _  . 
A. plant more flowers in the path 
B. beautify the neighborhood 
C. attract attention for his ad agency 
D. make the plants a feast for his eyes

Context: Dear Karen,
As you probably know, it's my sister Suzie's 16th birthday in a week. We're planning a surprise party for her. Julie's going to pick her up from school as usual on Friday but she's not taking her home. She's bringing her to the Palace Hotel, the big modern one near the station. We're having a meal there and we've also hired   the ballroom   for a party in the evening. I hope you can come!
All her friends from school are coming and quite a few of the people from our village, too. Of course, Mum and Dad are coming up from England and I've managed to persuade   our other sister, Marie, to come over from Australia. She's bringing her kids with her, too.
After the party we're going to have another one on Saturday! Well, not really a party. We're inviting the family and close friends (that includes you) for a meal at the house. If the weather is nice, we'd like to have a barbecue in the garden. Julie's going to make a special cake for Suzie.
Anyway, we hope to make it a really special weekend for Suzie. On Sunday we're all going for a walk in the country. You know how she loves walking and we're all going to need a bit of exercise after all that lovely food. We're hoping to go up to the lake. Marie said she wanted her kids to feed the ducks just like Suzie and she did when they were very young. I'm sure Suzie will love that too.
It would be great if you could come over for the weekend. We would all love to see you.
Let me know as soon as you can.
Best,
David

Context: It's just a small, white envelope stuck among the branches of our Christmas tree. No name, no address. It has peeked through the branches of our tree for the past 10 years.
It all began because my husband Mike hated Christmas. He didn't hate the true meaning of Christmas, but the commercial aspects of it; overspending, running around at the last minute to get a tie for Uncle Harry and powder for Grandma...
Knowing he felt this way, I decided one year to bypass the usual shirts, sweaters, ties and so forth. I reached for something special for Mike. The inspiration came in an unusual way.
Our son Kevin, at 12 that year, was wrestling at the junior level at the school he attended and before Christmas, there was a non-league match against a team sponsored by an inner-city church, mostly black.
As the match began, I was alarmed to see that the other team was wrestling without headgear to protect a wrestler's ears. They obviously could not afford.
Mike shook his head sadly, ""I wish just one of them could have won,"" he said. ""They have a lot of potential, but losing like this could _ .""
Mike loved kids--all kids--and he knew them, having coached little league football, baseball and lacrosse. That's when the idea for his present came.
That afternoon, I went to a local sporting goods store and bought an assortment of wrestling headgear and shoes and sent them anonymously to the inner-city church.
On Christmas Eve, I placed the envelope on the tree, the note inside telling Mike what I had done and that this was his gift from me. His smile was the brightest thing about Christmas that year. For each Christmas, I followed the tradition.
The envelope became the highlight of our Christmas. It was always the last thing opened on Christmas morning and our children, ignoring their new toys, would stand with wide-eyed anticipation as their dad lifted the envelope from the tree to reveal its contents.
The tradition has grown and someday will expand even further with our grandchildren standing around the tree with wide-eyed anticipation watching as their fathers take down the envelope. Mike's spirit, like the Christmas spirit, will always be with us. 
 Question:What can we infer from the passage? 
A. The tradition of sending presents will pass from generation to generation. 
B. The children were eager to get their new toys ignoring the envelope. 
C. With the presents, the poor kids will surely win the match one day. 
D. Mike's spirit, like the Christmas spirit, will always be with us.

Since then,the two good friends have never quarreled with each other again and they got on better with each other.

On Saturday morning we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron had come along with two friends,Kevin and Simon,while sisters Carole and Lynn had come with Amanda. There were some other members I didn't know. We had come from different places and none of us knew the area.
We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors,but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing and then we changed at lunchtime.

Context: Providing a highquality education for all children is important to America's economic future.President Obama has decided to provide every child with access to a complete and competitive education,from cradle  through career.
The years before a child reaches kindergarten are among the most _ in his or her life to influence learning.The President will urge states to introduce high standards across all publicly funded early learning settings,develop new programs to improve opportunities and outcomes,engage parents in their child's early learning and development,and improve the early education workforce.
President Obama will reform America's public schools to deliver a 21st century education that will prepare all children for success in the new global workplace.He will push to end the use of ineffective,""offtheshelf"" tests,and support new,stateoftheart assessment and responsibility systems that provide timely and useful information about the learning and progress of students.
Teachers are the single most important resource to children's learning.President Obama will invest in a national effort to reward outstanding teachers,while enlisting the best and brightest in the field of teaching.And he will challenge State and school districts to remove ineffective teachers from the classroom.
The President believes that investment in education must be accompanied by reform and innovation  .He supports the expansion of highquality charter schools  .He has challenged States to lift limits that stop growth among successful charter schools and has encouraged strict responsibility for all charter schools.
President Obama has decided to ensure that America will regain its lost ground and have the highest proportion of students graduating from college in the world by 2020.The President believes that regardless of educational path after high school,all Americans should enroll in at least one year of higher education or job training to better prepare our workforce for the 21st century economy.
To reach these goals,the President has decided to increase higher education access and success by restructuring and greatly expanding college financial aid,while making federal programs simpler,more reliable,and more efficient for students. 
 Question:Which of the following things is NOT part of President Obama's decision? 
A. Remove ineffective teachers from the classroom. 
B. Reform America's public schools. 
C. Enlist some teachers from other countries. 
D. Expand highquality charter schools. 
 Answer: C
Context: Pushy parents and teachers who ""hothouse"" the under-5s risk causing damage to the children's long term development, a leading education expert said.
Lilian Katz, Professor of Education at the University of Illinois, said that four-year-olds engaged in reading and writing went on to perform worse academically than those engaged in imaginative learning. They scored higher in tests at the age of 5, but children whose first year at school was stimulating _ them four years later.
The findings suggest that the government's structured approach to early years' learning could be storing up problems for children. They also raise serious questions about the plan for all children to be able to read by the age of 6.
In many countries formal teaching does not start until children are 6 or 7 and have improved their social and manual skills. Children start learning to read and write at 6 in the United States, France and Germany, and at 7 in Finland and Sweden.
Professor Katz said that in many schools the courses were ""boring children to tears"". Much academic teaching required children to learn by memorizing pieces of information out of context, she said. Teaching in reception class should instead allow children to develop their intellect by exploring their environments and asking questions.
""Research suggests the benefits of formal academic instruction for four- and five-year-olds seem to be promising when they are tested early, but considerably less so in the long term. When these children are followed over a period of three or more years, those who had early experience in more intellectually engaging curricula were more likely to do well in school than their peers, who had received early academic instruction."" She advocates teaching children through first-hand experience and play, in mixed-aged classes. This can include puppet shows, drawing or running a pretend shop in the classroom. 
 Question:According to Lilian Katz, the government's structured approach to early-years learning   _  . 
A. is necessary for improving children's reading and writing ability 
B. needs to be improved to develop children's academic ability 
C. will cause problems to children in their future learning 
D. has more advantages than disadvantages

Context: A little boy went to a farmer who had some puppies  to sell and said, ""I want to buy one of your puppies."" Then reaching deep into his pocket, he pulled out a handful of change and held it up to the farmer. ""I've got thirty-nine cents. Is that enough to take a look.""
""Sure,"" said the farmer. Then he called his dog, ""Here, Dolly!""
Out from the doghouse and down the ramp  ran Dolly followed by four little balls of fur. The little boy pressed his face against the chain link fence. His eyes danced with delight.
As the dogs made their way to the fence, the little boy noticed something else moving inside the doghouse. Slowly, another little ball appeared. This one was much smaller than the others. Down the ramp it slid . Then in a somewhat awkward manner the little pup began hobbling  toward the others, doing its best to catch up...
""I want that one,"" the little boy said, pointing to the slow dog.
The farmer knelt down at the boy's side and said, ""Son, you don't want that puppy. He will never be able to run and play with you like these other dogs will.""

Context: The drug store was closing for the night. Young Alfred Higgins, the shop-assistant, was ready to go home. Mr. Carr, the boss, stared at him and said: ""Stop! Alfred. Maybe you'd be good enough to take the things out of your pockets and leave them here before you go."" Alfred's face got red. After a little hesitation , he took out what he had stolen. Mr. Carr said, ""Maybe I should call you mother and let her know I'm going to have to put you in prison.""
Alfred thought his mother would come rushing in, eyes burning with anger. But, to his surprise, she arrived wearing a smile. ""Hello, I'm Alfred's mother. Is he in trouble?"" she said. Mr. Carr was surprised, too. He had expected Alfred's mother to come in nervously, shaking with fear, asking with wet eyes for a mercy   for her son. Yet, she was most calm, quiet, and pleasant, which made Mr. Carr feel guilty  . Soon Mr. Carr was shaking his head in agreement with what she was saying. ""Of course"", he said, ""I don't want to be cruel. You are right. Sometimes, a little good advice is the best thing for a boy at certain times in his life and it often takes the youth a long time to grow up."" And he warmly shook Mrs. Higgins's hand. 
Back home, without even looking at Alfred, she said, ""You are a burden. Your trouble came one after another, always! Why do you stand there so stupidly? Go to bed."" In his bedroom, Alfred heard his mother in the kitchen. Getting to the kitchen, he saw his mother drinking a cup of tea. His mother's face was a frightened, broken one, totally different from the earlier cool, bright face. She lifted the tea cup, her hands shaking, the lips moving nervously. 
He watched his mother quietly, without making a sound. The picture of his mother nearly made him cry. Realizing all the troubles he brought his mother in her shaking hands and the deep lines of worry in her grey face, he felt he shouldn't have done such a shameful theft to hurt his mother so deeply. He determined to grow up like a true man and protect his mother rather than hurt her again. 
 Question:The reason why Mr. Carr felt guilty was that   _  . 
A. Alfred's mother appeared polite and gentle 
B. he should have called a policeman at first 
C. he found Alfred was in fact not wrong 
D. he thought he was partly responsible for it

Context: Maxwell had not held a steady job in almost two years. Today was a big day, because he was going to a job interview that he felt good about. The secretary he had talked to on the phone sounded friendly and encouraging. 
Maxwell was a typist. His fingers danced on the keyboard. However, his people skills were not nearly as good as his typing skills. Sometimes his mouth got in the way of his employment. At his last steady job, his boss had told him to start making coffee every morning. Maxwell laughed. ""I'm not making coffee,"" he said. ""It's not part of my job description."" 
""Read the employee manual again,"" his boss said. ""Your job description is anything I say it is."" 
""That's a woman's job,"" said Maxwell. ""Do it yourself."" 
His boss was still yelling as Maxwell walked out of the building. He felt great about telling off the boss. A few days later, the reality of not having a job hit home. He had to pay the rent and utility bills, and he had to eat. What was he going to do? 
He thought about apologizing and asking for his job back. But how would that look? Then again, who cares how it looks when you're almost broke? After thinking about it for another week, he finally called his boss and apologized. His boss accepted his apology, but said that he had already hired a replacement. 
Maxwell contacted a temporary job agency, which provided him enough occasional work to pay his bills. But none of the companies that he was sent to were hiring. So Maxwell was excited about finally getting an interview for a steady job. 
Maxwell's drive to the interview was disappointing. The traffic was  _ and the neighborhood looked rough. It took him 45 minutes to get there. The building was covered with graffiti.  
The interview started 30 minutes late. Not bothering to apologize, the manager lit a cigarette and took a sip from his coffee cup. He leaned back in his chair and put his feet up on his desk. He asked Maxwell a lot of questions. Maxwell thought that each question was stupider than the preceding question. The final question was, ""Where would you like to be 10 years from now?"" 
What does that have to do with typing? Maxwell wondered. Stupid questions from a rude man in a lousy neighborhood! Where would he like to be 10 years from now? 
""Anywhere but this dump!"" Maxwell said angrily, as he stood up and walked out. 
 Question:According to the passage, which statement is right about the job interview? 
A. Maxwell was 30 minutes late. 
B. The manager got no manners in the interview. 
C. The interviewer asked a lot of silly questions except the last one.

Context: Tyler was a troublesome student. He sat in the back row. Every time I called him to answer questions, he'd reply with a flip answer. If he got it wrong, he would get very angry.
Usually kids could sit quietly in class. However, Tyler was just loud. One day, Tyler was talking while I was teaching. I said to him, ""Tyler, why not join in our discussion instead of having one of your own?"" He got up from his chair, pushed it over, and shouted something I can't remember. I sent him to the office and he received a week's out-of-school punishment.
The week was a wonderful time for me, but when it came to an end, I began to feel worried. So I came up with a plan. On the day of his return, I told him I wanted to start over with him. If he felt like he was going to lose control in class, he could step outside the door for a moment.
From then on, Tyler was a changed student in my classroom. In fact he was a smart child and he even stopped a fight between two students one day. And he never used the privilege to leave the class for a moment. I believe that just letting him decide for himself made all the difference.
When the year was over, he wrote me a thank-you note about how good the year had been for him. I still have it today and find it very moving to reread when I get stressed about teaching.

A. sitting in the back row

C. stopping a fight between two students 
D. not listening to teachers in class

Context: Every man wants his son to be somewhat of a clone, not in features but in footsteps. As he grows you also age, and your ambitions become more unachievable. You begin to realize that your boy, in your footsteps, could probably accomplish what you hoped for. But footsteps can be muddied and they can go off in different directions.
My son Jody has hated school since day one in kindergarten. Science projects waited until the last moment. Book reports weren't written until the final threat.
I've been a newspaperman all my adult life. My daughter is a university graduate working toward her master's degree in English. But Jody? When he entered the tenth grade he became a ""vo-tech"" student . They're called ""motorheads"" by the rest of the student body.
When a secretary in my office first called him ""motorhead"", I was shocked. ""Hey, he's a good kid,"" I wanted to say. ""And smart, really.""
I learned later that motorheads are, indeed, different. They usually have dirty hands and wear dirty work clothes. And they don't often make school honor rolls .
But being the parent of a motorhead is itself an experience in education. We who labor in clean shirts in offices don't have the abilities that motorheads have. I began to learn this when I had my car crashed. The cost to repair it was estimated at $800. ""Hey, I can fix it,"" said Jody. I doubted it , but let him go ahead, for I had nothing to lose.
My son ,with other motorheads, fixed the car. They got parts from a junkyard, non-toasting toaster have been fixed. Neighbours and co-workers trust their car repair to him.
Since that first repair job, a broken air-conditioner, a non-functioning washer and a non-toasting toaster have been fixed. Neighbors and co-workers trust their car repairs to him.
These kids are happiest when doing repairs. They joke and laugh and are living in their own relaxed world. And their minds are bright despite their dirty hands and clothes.
I have learned a lot from my motorhead: publishers need printers, engineers need mechanics, and architects need builders. Most important, I have learned that fathers don't need clones in footsteps or anywhere else.
My son may never make the school honor roll. But he made mine. 
 Question:What used to be the author's hope for his son? 
A. To avoid becoming his clone. 
B. To resemble him in appearance. 
C. To develop in a different direction. 
D. To reach the author's unachieved goals.

Context: (Reuters)--Ceremonies to celebrate divorces have gained momentum in Japan after the massive March earthquake and tsunami, followed by an ongoing nuclear crisis, caused unhappy couples to reassess their lives.
The ceremony to mark a couple's transition to being single again costs 55,000 yen ($690), includes a buffet meal and culminates with the ritual smashing of their wedding rings with a gavel.
Tomoharu Saito, who took part in Tokyo with his wife Miki days before they were set to file for divorce, said crushing the rings felt cathartic. .
""I did not think the ring could be crushed that easily, but it did,""he said. 
""I was shocked but at the same time, I feel it helped me make a clean break.""
The ceremony also includes a ""divorce dress,"" and Miki Saito chose a daisy-yellow summer dress. In Japan, daisies are believed to symbolize an a ""friendly relationship"".
Designer Akiue Go said he created the dress with emphasis on the back for a specific reason. 
""I designed this dress so the woman's back looks the most beautiful when she turns around and walks away,"" he said. 
Hiroki Terai, a 31-year-old former salesman, spotted a gap in the market and pioneered the divorce ceremony two years ago. Since then, he's celebrated more than 80 breakups.
Requests for the ceremony have tripled since the March 11 9.0 magnitude quake set off a massive tsunami.
""The March 11 disaster made many couples rethink their priorities. Some found that work was a higher priority to them than family, and this helped people gain the confidence to decide on a divorce,"" Terai said.
""Those who want an amicable divorce are doing these ceremonies.""
Miki Saito said the earthquake made her realize she wanted to be closer to her parents, who live in northeastern Japan in one of the areas badly affected by the quake.
""After the quake, my desire to go back and live with my parents grew stronger,"" she said.
Guest Hiroko Tada was present for both the beginning and the end of the Saitos' marriage. ""I'd say congratulations to the amicable divorce,"" she said. ""I could have never imagined this day would come because I was at their wedding, but since they did break up, this is one of the best ways to do it."" 
 Question:How much has the divorce ceremony held by Terai cost in the past two years? 
A. About 56,000 yen 
B. About $50,000 
C. Less than 440,000 yen 
D. Over $ 55,200 
 Answer: D
Context: If you are a wealthy resident of India, madly in love and planning your big fat wedding--or being pressured into arranged marriage--Thailand wants you to exchange vows  in Bangkok, Phuket or elsewhere in this ""wedding Paradise "".
This wedding business starts from overseas with the Indians. Thai embassies in India give quick services for the visas. Not only the couples, you can bring anyone, say, your own cook. So, feel free to invite hundreds of your friends and relatives.
Why would Indians want to spend so much on weddings in Thailand? Because they have similarities in religion. When Indian weddings want to have some religious prayer for the couples, Thailand can do that. But the more obvious appeal are Thailand's fancy hotels, tropical islands, and delicious Thai food, allowing newlyweds to include a honeymoon in Thailand after they say ""I do"" while their guests also celebrate on a holiday here. But on the other hand, love does have a price.
Kasu Rajagopal arranged for his daughter to have a wedding in Phuket. They arranged entertainment to begin three days before the wedding, because guests' arrival time varied. Yachts were chartered to take guests to small islands, while a DJ, flown in from Bangalore, India, was booked to help them dance in the evening. Kasu also arranged priests for the Hindu wedding, and cooks to prepare Indian food. The approximate costs are around half a million U. S. dollars, including the airfares, hotel accommodation, food, transportation, the yachts on hire and the wedding ceremony expenses, for 225 to 250 guests.
Thailand wants to make itself a wedding paradise for all couples, not just from India, but from around the world. Last year, there were around 500 to 600 couples from China, and the numbers are slowly coming up. Westerners also arrive to get married, but in much smaller numbers. 
 Question:What is the main reason why the Indians would go to Thailand for weddings? 
A. They will be pressured into arranged married in India. 
B. India shares the same religion as Thailand. 
C. Thailand offers them more than just a wedding ceremony. 
D. Guests are not satisfied with Indian weddings.

Context: Dear Guys,
I'd like to talk to you about the two minutes of total embarrassments you put me through last night. You a group of fit, young men, were playing soccer on the field across from my apartment building, I, a beautiful looking young woman, was walking by with my groceries. That's when your ball came flying over the fence and landed at my feet. One of you came to me, and asked politely if I would throw the ball back to you.
Fighting the urge to flee screaming down the street, I agreed. And I put my bags down, picked up the ball and with eyes half shut, threw it as hard as I could. It hit the middle of the fence and bounced right back to me.
I picked up the ball again and threw the ball upward with all my strength. The ball once again hit slightly higher up on the fence and bounced back to me. This is the point where I start to blame you. Wouldn't it have been a better use of your time, and mine, if you had just walked around the fence and collected the ball then? I was clearly struggling. And yet you all just stood there, staring.
Seeing that you weren't  going to get the ball yourselves, I become desperate. But I picked up the soccer ball for the third time. I forced a smile while crying inside as you patiently shouted words of support over the fence at me like I was a two-year-old holding a beech ball for the first time.
""Throw it granny-style!"" one of you said. ""Just back up a little end throw it hard!"" another offered And, most embarrassing of all, ""You can do it!"" I know you thought you were being encouraging, but it only served to deepen the embarrassment. However, I accepted your advice, took a deep breath, and let it fly. It hid the edge of the -fence and bounced back to me.
I hoped that I would have a heart attack and pass out, just so I'd be put out of my misery. Alas, the heart attack didn't happen. Finally, I had to pick up the ball, walked close to the fence, and said angrily, ""Please just come top get it."" And you did. And thanks to you, I decided at that moment I would never throw anything over again, except scornful glances at people who play sports.
Sincerely yours,
Jen Cordery

On Saturday morning we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron had come along with two friends,Kevin and Simon,while sisters Carole and Lynn had come with Amanda. There were some other members I didn't know. We had come from different places and none of us knew the area.
We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors,but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing and then we changed at lunchtime.

Context: How much empathy do you feel towards other people? If you saw someone fall off their bike in traffic,would you stop and help--or just walk away? Many people would give in to coldness,go about their business and just do nothing.So it was a big surprise when about  100 bystanders got together recently to move a bus in east London to help a cyclist trapped under it.A video of the incident went viral on social media.
According to Zoheb,a driver who stopped his car to take part in the rescue,about five  people gathered to move the bus.He says:""There was no chance we could do it,it was more  an invitation for other people to help,really.""
The initiative paid off.Diners from nearby restaurants joined in.There wasn't much coordination but it didn't take long to develop a collective understanding of what the  objective was.
Spontaneous cooperation among strangers doesn't happen often.People in a  crowd are not sure what to do--they don't have a plan.It's one of the reasons bystanders often do nothing,according to Dr Mark Levine,professor of social psychology at Exeter University in Britain.""The presence of others can prevent you from helping"",he says.
The key to positive group behaviour,Levine explains,""is building a sense of shared identity"".Action has to be decided quickly,Levine says.""The longer you leave it,the harder it is to make a decision.If you don't immediately act then you kind of think'Well,actually I probably couldn't have done anything anyway'.""
But the people who took the initiative like Zoheb might make a difference.The cyclist ended up in hospital and the images of the collective effort might inspire others to more acts of unity. 
 Question:Why do people give in to coldness when they should be helping according to Levine? 
A. They don't know how to give first aid. 
B. Nobody wants to be the first to offer help. 
C. Strangers seldom cooperate with each other. 
D. They are forbidden from helping. 
 Answer: C
Context: Charlotte's Web is a popular American children's book about the friendship between a pig named Wilbur and a spider  named Charlotte. The writer, E.B. White, shows that a real friend will help you even though he or she has nothing to get from doing so.
In the book, Charlotte is always helping Wilbur. She spins  words into her web to save Wilbur's life, even though spinning the words is tiring and difficult for her. Charlotte is a true friend. She helps Wilbur for only one reason - she cares about him.
Templeton, the rat, on the other hand, is not a real friend to Wilbur. Templeton only helps others when there is something in it for him. When he is asked to help save Wilbur's life, he says ""no"" at first. Later on, he agrees to help, but only because he wants to keep eating Wilbur's meals. At the end of the book, Wilbur learns the true meaning of friendship. He helps Charlotte to save her babies. He does this not for other reasons, but because he cares about his friend.
Reading this book lets me know how important it is to help others. Being a good friend means being there when you are needed.

Context: Dear Betty,
My roommate's family wants me to celebrate Thanksgiving Day with them in their home. I accepted the invitation, and I'm excited about going, but I'm a little nervous about it, too. The social customs in my country are different from those here, so I'm a little worried about making mistakes.
Should I bring a gift, such as candy or flowers? Should I arrive on time or a little late?  At the dinner table, how can I know which fork or knife to use? How can I let the family know that I'm thankful for their kindness?
                                               Yours,
                                               Knowing Nothing
Dear Knowing Nothing,
 It's a good idea to bring a gift when you go to a dinner party. Flowers are always welcome, or you can bring a bottle of wine if you know the family drink it.
You should arrive on time or five to ten minutes late. Don't get there early. If you are going to be more than fifteen minutes late, you should call and tell them.
Try to relax at the dinner table. If you don't know how to use the right fork, knife or spoon, just watch the other guests, and follow them. If you still have no idea of what to do, don't be shy about asking the person next to you; it's better to ask them than to be silently uncomfortable and nervous.
If you like the food, say so. Of course, you'll thank the host and hostess for the meal and for their kindness. It's also a good idea to send a card to thank them the day after.
                                          Yours,
                                              Betty

Context: What could make Michael Jordon, one of the greatest basketball players in history, shed tears?  It was when he became a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame on September 11. The hall is in Springfield, Massachusetts and honors the best basketball players, greatest coaches and other contributors to the game. ""The game of basketball has been everything to me ,"" said Jordan, 46. ""It is the place I have always gone when I needed to find comfort and peace.""
Jordan retired twice in his 15-year career, finishing with 32292 points, the third highest total points in NBA history behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone. His average of 30.12 points a game is the best in the League.
""One day you might look up and see me playing the game at 50,"" Jordan said. ""Because limits, like fears, are often just an illusion.""   In other words, it was motivation that made Jordan such a success..
A great career did not mean a smooth one. His high school coach cut him from the team in favor of a taller player when Jordan was in 10thgrade. His college coach wouldn't allow him on the cover of Sports Illustration in 1981 with North Carolina's four other players because Jordan was a freshman. In his first NBA All-Star game, older NBA stars wouldn't throw him the ball because of jealousy.
""That burned me up,"" Jordan said. ""But _ don't have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it."" 
 Question:When Jordan became a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame,  _ 
A. he found something more encouraging . 
B. he was so excited that he couldn't hold his tears back.

Context: Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver, and the other gold.
This song expresses a nice rule: increasing friends. Sometimes things actually work out that way. I've met adults who've said, ""We've been friends since kindergarten!"" A friend who has known you forever is a treasure. But friendships don't always last -- especially for children.
When I was growing up, my family moved about every three years. The advantage of this was that I got to see different parts of the world, and it made my family very close. I also learned to be pretty good at making new friends, and, to keep in touch with old friends, I became a great letter writer. But I always admired those kids who stayed in one place and kept their friends for a long time. I didn't learn that children's friendships can disappear even when no one moves until I was much older, with children of my own.
Sometimes friendships end in quarrels and hurt feelings. But perhaps the most painful end to a friendship is the one-sided rejection -- one friend turns away, or chooses someone else as a close friend, and the other child is left feeling sad and wondering why this thing happened. The end of a friendship is often sad, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. Often the end of one friendship makes more room for other friendships to grow. 
 Question:When his family moved often, the author couldn't  _  . 
A. make friends easily 
B. become a good letter writer 
C. stay with his friends for a long time 
D. see many different places 
 Answer: C
Context: Being able to count at least ten people as friends makes us happy, but those with five or fewer are likely to be miserable, researchers say. Their study of hundreds of men and women also found t hat people who feel satisfied with their lives always have lots of close friends and regularly make new ones. While it is not clear whether our friends make us happy or we make friends because we are happy, the researchers say it is clear that we should maintain our friendships. Psychologist RichardTunney said, ""Whatever the reason is, actively working on friendships in the same way as to maintain a marriage is a prerequisite  to happiness. ""Dr. Tunney, of Nottingham University, quizzed more than 1,700 people about their satisfaction  with their lives and the state of their friendships. Those with five friends or fewer had just a 40 percent chance of being happy.  In other words they were more likely to be unhappy than happy. Ten was the first number at which people were more likely to be happy than unhappy. The happiest people were those with dozens of friends, according to the study, which was carried out for the National Lottery .
For women, this meant having 33 friends;for men, the number was 49. Dr. Tunney said,""People who were extremely satisfied with their lives had twice the number of friends of people  who were extremely dissatisfied. "" Women tended to have fewer friends than men but formed tighter relationships. Interestingly, the study found that childhood friends are no more likely to make us happy than people we become close to later in life. Lottery winners, however, have a differentopinion on life. They are always happier than others despite spending their time with asmall circle of old friends. This could be because they trust people they've known for along time. 
 Question:What's the best title for this passage? 
A. The Secret to Happiness Is to Make New Friends 
B. Having at Least 10 Good Friends Makes People Happy 
C. Why Most People Like to Make Friends Regularly 
D. Men's and Women's Friends Are Different

Context: The judge  thought Geoffrey Payne killed his wife. Now for the first time Payne wrote to a magazine from the prison about what happened on the night of 13 October 1999.
I had to stay late at the hospital that night to do an operation. I finally left at about 11p.m.. I drove home slowly because the wind was blowing and it was raining heavily. I was running into our road when a man suddenly ran in front of my car. I almost hit him but I stopped just in time. I was scared and the man looked scared, too. I got out of the car but he ran away before I could ask if he was all right. It was very strange.
When I got home, the lights were on but it was very quiet. I called to my wife but there was no answer. Then I remembered that she was out at a concert.
I was still very unhappy about what happened on the road, so I made myself a drink. Then I went upstairs to have a bath. I saw that the window in the bedroom was open. This was strange because my wife always locked the doors and windows before she went out. She was afraid of burglars. When I went to close it, I found Ellen. She was lying on the floor. There was blood everywhere. I rushed over for her pulse but she was dead. I was so scared. I sat on the floor beside her body without knowing what to do.
The next thing I knew was that the sky was getting light. I can't remember a thing about that night. In the morning I phoned the police. They arrived half an hour after I phoned them. But it seemed like hours. During that time I tried hard to remember anything I could about the night before. I couldn't stop thinking about the man in the road. What was he doing at that time of night in our quiet neighborhood? 
 Question:In this passage Payne tried to  _  . 
A. show he was sorry for his wife's death 
B. show he was guilty for murdering his wife 
C. tell why his wife was killed that night 
D. say the man in the road was probably the murderer

Context: When I was at university,  I studied very hard. But a lot of my friends did very little work. Some did just enough to pass exams. Others didn't do quite enough. Fred Baines was one of them. He spent more time drinking in the Students' Union than working in the library. Once, at the end of the term, we had to take an important test in chemistry. The test had a hundred questions. Beside each question we had to write ""True"" or ""False"". While I was studying in my room the night before the test, Fred was watching television. Fred usually worried a lot the night before a test. But that night he looked perfectly calm. Then he told me of his plan. ""It's very simple. There are a hundred questions and I have to get fifty correct to pass the test. I'll take a coin into the examination room. I haven't studied a chemistry book for months, so I'll just toss the coin. In that way, I'm sure I'll get half the questions right."" The next day, Fred came cheerfully into the examination room. As he sat tossing a coin for half an hour he marked down his answers. Then he left half an hour before the rest of us. The next day, he saw the chemistry professor in the corridor.
""Oh good,"" he said, ""Have you got the results of the test?""
The professor looked at him and smiled.
""Ah, it's you, Baines, just a minute.""
Then he reached into his pocket and took out a coin. He threw it into the air, caught it in his hand and looked at it.
""I'm terribly sorry, Baines,"" he said, ""You failed!""

letters she wrote to her parents from the school.
Wentworth Girls' School
Beachside
July 20th
Dearest Mom and Dad,
I'm afraid I have some very bad news for you. I have been very naughty and the school principal is very angry with me. She is going to write to you. You must come and take me away from here. She does not want me in the school any longer.
The trouble started last night when I was smoking in bed.  This is against the rules, of course. We are not supposed to smoke at all.
As I was smoking, I heard footsteps coming towards the room. I did not want a teacher to catch me smoking, so I threw the cigarette away.
Unfortunately, the cigarette fell into the waste-paper basket, which caught fire.
There was a curtain near the waste-paper basket which caught fire, too. Soon the whole room was burning.
The principal phoned for the fire department. The school is a long way from the town and by the time the fire department arrived, the whole school was in flames. Many of the girls are in the hospital.
The principal says that the fire was all my fault and you must pay for the damage. She will send you a bill for about a million dollars.
I'm very sorry about this.
Much love,
Sarah

Context: Migrants to the UK are to be quizzed about their English skills before being able to claim income-related benefits, the government has announced.
In a move to ""protect the integrity of the benefits system"", people will also be asked what efforts they have made to find work before coming to Britain. Work and Pensions Secretary Duncan Smith said people should not be able to ""take advantage"" of British benefits. Job centres in England, Scotland and Wales will use the ""more mighty"" test. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said the test would ensure ""only migrants who have a legal right to be in Britain and plan to contribute to this country can make a claim for benefits"".
""For the first time, migrants will be quizzed about what efforts they have made to find work before coming to the UK and whether their English language skills will be a barrier to them finding employment,"" the DWP said in a statement.
Income-related benefits include council tax benefit, housing benefit, income-based jobseeker's allowance and pension credit.
Mr. Duncan Smith said British people were ""rightly concerned"" that migrants should contribute to the economy and should not be ""drawn here by the attractiveness of our benefits system"".
""It is vitally important that we have strict rules in place to protect the integrity of our benefits system,"" he said. He said the new test would help create a fair system which provided for ""genuine"" workers and jobseekers but ""does not allow people to come to our country and take advantage"".
To claim the benefits, migrants will have to pass a ""habitual residence test"" including more than 100 extra questions compared to now. This will be overseen by an ""intelligent IT system"" which will ensure questions are ""tailored to each individual _ "".
Migrants will be allowed to claim benefits if they can prove they are legally allowed to be in Britain and are ""habitually resident"" of the country. As part of this they might be questioned about what measures they have taken to ""establish"" themselves in Britain and what ties they still have abroad.
""They will also have to provide more evidence that they are doing everything they can to find a job,"" the DWP said. 
 Question:What does the passage mainly want to inform us? 
A. All migrants can claim benefits from the UK. 
B. Income-related benefits can be a great help to migrants. 
C. All migrants come to the UK only to claim benefits. 
D. Migrants are to pass a test to get the benefits from the UK.

Context: It was a quarter past nine as Marie hurried into the office building where she was going to work. Her bus had inched along through heavy morning traffic, making her a few minutes late for her very first job. She decided to start out half an hour earlier the next day  
Once inside the lobby, she had to stand at the elevators and wait several minutes before she could get on one going to the sixth floor. When she finally reached the office marked ""King Enterprises"", she knocked at the door nervously and waited. There was no answer. She tapped on the door again, but still, there was no reply. From inside the next office, she could hear the sound of voices, so she opened the door and went in. Although she was sure it was the same office she had been in two weeks before when she had had the interview with Mr King, it looked quite different now. In fact, it hardly looked like an office at all. The employees were just standing around chatting and smoking. At the far end of the room, somebody must have just told a good joke, she thought, because there was a loud burst of laughter as she came in. 
For a moment she had thought they were laughing at her. Then one of the men looked at his watch, clapped his hands and said something to the others. Quickly they all went to their desks and, in a matter of seconds, everyone was hard at work. No one paid any attention to Marie. 
Finally she went up to the man who was sitting at the desk nearest to the door and explained that this was her first day in the office. Hardly looking up from his work, he told her to have a seat and wait for Mr King, who would arrive at any moment. Then Marie realised that the day's work in the office began just before Mr King arrived. 
Later she found out that he lived in Connecticut and came into Manhattan on the same train every morning, arriving in the office at 9:35, so that his staff knew exactly when to start working. 
 Question:The people in the office suddenly started working because  _ 
A. they saw a stranger in the office 
B. they had finished their morning break 
C. no one wanted to talk to Marie 
D. the boss was about to arrive

Context: The professor stood before his class of 30 senior biology students, about to pass out the final exam. ""I have been honored to be your teacher this term, and I know how hard you have all worked to prepare for this test. I also know most of you are off to medical school or graduate school next fall,"" he said to them.
""I can well understand how much pressure you are under to keep your grades up, and because I know you are able to understand this material, I am prepared to offer an automatic  ""B"" to anyone who would prefer not to take the final.""
In relief a number of students jumped up to thank the professor and left the class. The professor looked at the students who remained, and offered again, ""Any other takers? This is your last chance."" One more student decided to go.
There were seven students left. The professor closed the door. Then he handed out the final exam. There were only two sentences typed on the paper: ""Congratulations, you have just received an ""A"" in this class. Keep believing in yourself.""
I never had a professor who gave a test like that. It may seem like the easy way out of grading   a lot of exams, but it's a test that any teacher in any subject could and should give. Students who don't have confidence in what they've learned are ""B"" students at best.
The same is true for students of real life. The ""A"" students are those who believe in what they're doing because they've learned from both successes and failures. They have learned life's lessons, whether from formal education or the school of hard knocks, and become better people.
Take your cue  from Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person to reach the top of Mount Qomolangma: ""It's not the mountain we conquer  , but ourselves."" Don't let the biggest limit be yourself. 
 Question:According to the text, which of the following statements is TRUE? 
A. 22 students got a ""B"" in the final test without doing the paper. 
B. Most of the students would go to medical school shortly after the exam. 
C. There were actually no problems on the test papers for the students to work out. 
D. The way the professor tested his students would not be suitable for other subjects. 
 Answer: C
Context: It was the last day of the final exam in a college. Outside the classroom, a group of students were waiting for the last exam. On their faces was confidence.
They knew the exam would be easy. The teacher said they could bring any books or notes during the test.
Right after they came into the classroom. The teacher handed out the papers. There were only five questions on it.
Three hours passed. Then the teacher began to collect the papers. The students no longer looked _ but they looked very nervous. The teacher watched these worried faces, and then asked. ""How many of you finished all five questions?"" No one answered. ""How many of you answered four?"" Still no one put up the hand. ""Three? Two?"" The students moved restlessly in their seats. ""One, then? Certainly somebody finished one."" But the class kept silent . The teacher said, ""That is what I thought. I just want to make you know clearly that you finished four years of study, but there are still many things about the subject you don't know. These questions you could not answer are common  in everyday life."" Then, he smiled and said ""You will all pass this exam, but it doesn't mean that you learned the subject well. There are still more things for you to learn in your later life.""
Now we can't remember the name of this teacher clearly, but we can't forget the lesson he taught us. 
 Question:.Why did the students think the exam was easy at first? 
A. Because it was their last exam in the college. 
B. Because they knew there were only five questions. 
C. Because they thought they were clever and talented. 
D. Because they could bring any books and notes into the classroom during the test.

Context: Being able to count at least ten people as friends makes us happy, but those with five or fewer are likely to be miserable, researchers say. Their study of hundreds of men and women also found t hat people who feel satisfied with their lives always have lots of close friends and regularly make new ones. While it is not clear whether our friends make us happy or we make friends because we are happy, the researchers say it is clear that we should maintain our friendships. Psychologist RichardTunney said, ""Whatever the reason is, actively working on friendships in the same way as to maintain a marriage is a prerequisite  to happiness. ""Dr. Tunney, of Nottingham University, quizzed more than 1,700 people about their satisfaction  with their lives and the state of their friendships. Those with five friends or fewer had just a 40 percent chance of being happy.  In other words they were more likely to be unhappy than happy. Ten was the first number at which people were more likely to be happy than unhappy. The happiest people were those with dozens of friends, according to the study, which was carried out for the National Lottery .
For women, this meant having 33 friends;for men, the number was 49. Dr. Tunney said,""People who were extremely satisfied with their lives had twice the number of friends of people  who were extremely dissatisfied. "" Women tended to have fewer friends than men but formed tighter relationships. Interestingly, the study found that childhood friends are no more likely to make us happy than people we become close to later in life. Lottery winners, however, have a differentopinion on life. They are always happier than others despite spending their time with asmall circle of old friends. This could be because they trust people they've known for along time. 
 Question:What's the best title for this passage? 
A. The Secret to Happiness Is to Make New Friends 
B. Having at Least 10 Good Friends Makes People Happy 
C. Why Most People Like to Make Friends Regularly 
D. Men's and Women's Friends Are Different

Context: A mouse looked through a crack  in the wall to see the farmer and his wife opening a package; what food might it contain? He was astonished to discover that it was a mouse trap!
Running to the farmyard, the mouse shouted, warning everyone, ""There is a mouse trap in the house, there is a mouse trap in the house.""
The chicken, with her head high, glared at the mouse and said, ""Shut up. Little Ugly. This is a great concern to you, but it has nothing to do with me; I can't be troubled by it.
The mouse turned to the pig and told him, ""There is a mouse trap in the house."" ""I am so sorry, Mr. Mouse,"" said the pig sympathetically, ""but there is nothing I can do about it but pray; you are always in my prayers.""
The mouse turned to the cow, who relied, "" A mouse trap, am I in great danger, huh?""
Now the mouse had to face the farmer's mouse trap alone.
The very night a sound was heard through the house, like that of a mouse trap catching its
. The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught. In the darkness, she did not see it was a big poisonous snake whose tail the trap had caught. The snake bit the farmer's wife. The farmer rushed her to the hospital. She returned home with a fever.

His wife's sickness continued, so friends and neighbors came to sit with her around the clock. To feed them, the farmer killed the pig. The farmer's wife did not get well, in fact, she died, and so many people came for her funeral. The farmer had the cow killed to provide for all of them to eat.

Context: Busy as I am every day, I always open my computer and check my email. Most of the time I am simply doing finger exercises, another form of piano practice without beautiful tones. Sometimes, however, I receive a gift, reminding me of the gifts in my life. The following passage is one of those gifts.
Peter Jones is a 92-year-old, short, calm and proud man. Every morning he is fully dressed by eight o'clock, with his hair fashionably combed and face perfectly shaved even though hi is unable to see anything. He would move to a nursing home today. His wife of 70 years old has recently passed away, making the move necessary.
After hours of waiting patiently in the entrance hall of the nursing home, he smiled sweetly when told his room was ready. As he moved his walking stick skillfully to the elevator, the nurse provided a visual description of his tiny room. ""I love it,"" he stated with enthusiasm. ""Mr. Jones, you haven't been the room,"" said the nurse.
""That doesn't have anything to do with it,"" he replied. ""Happiness is something you decide on ahead of time. Whether I like my room or not doesn't depend on how the furniture is arranged...it's how I arrange my mind. I have already decided to love _ It's a decision I make every morning when I wake up. I have a choice: I can spend the day in bed complaining of the difficulty I have with the parts of my body that no longer work, or get out of bed and be thankful for the ones that do.""
Each day is a gift, and as long as we are alive. We'll focus on the new day and all the happy memories we've stored just as Mr. Jones does. 
 Question:How did Mr. Jones feel about his room in the nursing home? 
A. worried 
B. curious

D. content

Context: To Mr. Alcohol
You've been with us for a long time. I won't forget all the pain you've caused for us.
Do you remember the night you almost took my father's life? I do. He loves you. Sometimes I think he loves you more than he loves me. He's addicted to you, to the way you promise to rid him of his problems only to cause more of them. You just sat back and laughed as his car went spinning through the street, crashing into two other cars. He wasn't the only one hurt by you that night.
Do you remember the night of my first high school party? You were there. My friends were _ by you. They treated you as if they were never going to see you again, drinking all of you that they could. I spent two hours that night helping my friends who had fallen completely. ""I'm so embarrassed,"" they said as I held their hair back so that they could vomit  . ""I'm sorry,"" they said when I called taxies for them, walking them out and paying the driver in advance. ""This won't happen again,"" they said as they were sent to the hospital to have their stomachs pumped  . Two 15-year-old girls slept in hospital beds that night thanks to you.
Do you remember the night when you took advantage of my 17-year-old neighbor who had to drive to pick up his sister from her dance lessons? Do you know how we all felt when he hit another car and killed the two people in the other car? He died the next morning too. His sister walked home from her dance lesson, and passed police cars and a crowd of people gathering on the sidewalk just two blocks away from the dance studio. She didn't realize her brother was in the midst of it all. She never saw him again. And it's all your fault.
I wish you'd walk out of my life forever. I don't want anything to do with you. Look at all the pain you've caused. Sure, you've made people happy too from time to time. But the damage you've caused in the lives of millions is inexcusable. Stop luring in the people I love. Stop hurting me, please. 
 Question:What did alcohol do to the author's father?

B. It made him drink too much and he had to get his stomach pumped. 
C. It made him kill two other people when driving.

Context: Peter waved goodbye and closed the door slowly as Jane left home to visit her grandmother. Expecting a whole day to relax, he was thinking whether to read the newspaper or watch his favorite TV talk show on his first day off in months. ""This will be like a walk in the park,"" he'd told his wife, ""I'll look after the kids, and you can go to visit your grandma.""
Things started well, but just after eight o'clock, his three little ""good kids""--Adam, Bob, and Christopher--came down the stairs in their night clothes and shouted ""breakfast, daddy."" When food had not appeared within thirty seconds, Adam began using his spoon on Christopher's head as if it were a drum. Christopher started to shout loudly in time to the beat  . Bob chanted ""Where's my toast, where's my toast"" in the background. Peter realized his newspaper would have to wait for a few seconds.
Life became worse after breakfast. Adam wore Bob's underwear on his head. Bob locked himself in the bathroom, while Christopher shouted again because he was going to wet his pants. Nobody could find clean socks, although they were before their very eyes. Someone named ""Not Me"" had spilled a whole glass of orange juice into the basket of clean clothes. Peter knew the talk show had already started.
By ten o'clock, things were out of control. Christopher was wondering why the fish in the jar refused his bread and butter. Adam was trying to show off his talent by decorating the kitchen wall with his color pencils. Bob, thankfully, appeared to be reading quietly in the family room, but closer examination showed that he was eating apple jam straight from the bottle with his hands. Peter realized that the talk show was over and reading would be impossible.
At exactly 11:17, Peter called the daycare centre  .""I suddenly have to go into work and my wife's away. Can I bring the boys over in a few minutes?"" The answer was obviously ""yes"" because Peter was smiling.

Context: In May, 2014, some Chinese tourists found a Chinese-character message ""Ding Jinhao once visited here"" on a statue of god in a 3500-year-old Egyptian temple. An angry tourist took the photograph of the scrawl and posted it on social media Sina Weibo. It was quickly spread and there were more than 100,000 comments during two weeks. Later, a 15-year-old Chinese boy was searched out as the person who caved this message. Many netizens expressed their anger and disappointment for the uncivilized behavior. They searched and identified the boy and then posted his personal information including the address and pictures online.
Over the weekend, his school's website was hacked, and reporters flooded into his home in the city of Nanjing. Besieged by reporters, the child's mother offered a formal apology for her son's behavior. ""We want to apologize to the Egyptian people and to people who have paid attention to this case across China."" the boy's mother told the local newspaper.
With China's economy booming over the past decades, a growing number of the country's residents have become global tourists. Earlier this month, Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang addressed: ""Uncivilized behavior of some of tourists is giving this country a bad reputation abroad."" The discussion about Chinese quality was carried out on many media.
On the bright side, Egypt government described the damage to the temple as superficial and could be restored and they would forgive the boy. While the act of Ding Jinhao symbolizes a national shame, meanwhile, many people concern about the child's development and wish he could return to anonymity once more. ""The boy has known his mistake and cried all night. He has to be moved around because reporters rushes to his house for interviews."" said a reporter who talked with the parents. 
 Question:The writer uses the quotation by Vice Premier Wang Yang to show   _  . 
A. Chinese people are influential 
B. China is a civilized country 
C. People shouldn't go abroad 
D. Some misconducts are bad for our image 
 Answer: D
Context: Some Chinese shops have stopped selling Japanese goods in protest against Tokyo's approval of a school history book they say  _ Japan's militaristic past.
       It was not clear how many Chinese stores had stopped selling Japanese products, but one association official told Renters that the boycott had begun in Shanghai, the country's business center, and the northeast city of Shenyang.
       Chinese protests against Japan's bid for a permanent seat in the U.N. Security Council. Millions of Chinese have already signed an online demand against giving Japan a permanent seat.
       South Korea also has criticized the Japanese text book decision. The Korean English-language newspaper Korea Times ran an article on Monday criticizing that action.
       It said: ""A civic education text even has a picture of Tokto( ) as Japanese district on its cover. We cannot help but wonder how many countries in the world would be teaching their children in such wrong words.""
       It went on to say: ""The country is already a global power and should show regional leadership, not by force but by moral superiority. Tokyo doesn't appear to be reaching forward in this direction."" 
 Question:How many cities which led a boycott of the goods are listed in the passage? 
A. One. 
B. Two. 
C. Three. 
D. Four.

Context: Several weeks ago, kidsPost did a story on ""The Art of Video Games"" at the Smithsonian American Art Museum.

A video game is like a painting on a screen. In order to make a video game, you have to think of something original to reach the players. This is the point of Art.

Context: Several overseas trips with the family have taught us that they can be rewarding, but you always have to be careful of pickpockets.
On a lovely visit to Paris an encounter with a pickpocket gave the would-be thief a little more than he _ 
While walking down the famous Champs Elysee, I was astonished to feel someone unzip my handbag and remove my purse. I turned to glimpse a young man turning away and pretending to be absorbed in the mouth-watering contents on display in a bakery window.
Being only a teenager at the time, I had no idea what to do. So I tapped the young man in question on the shoulder and said.
""Excuse me can you please give me back my purse?""
Of course the pickpocket had no idea what I was saying (and didn't want to know) and proceeded to shrug his shoulders and basically say (in French) ""I don't speak English""?
Meanwhile my Mother (a Scotswoman with a bad temper), came to see why I had stopped walking and what was going on. When I informed her of the situation she lost control and started yelling at the thief who still stood there making gestures in French while a crazy Scotswoman harangued  him. At this stage we were starting to attract onlookers, and when my Mother started hitting the young man with her handbag the would-be thief decided it was time to get away.
Luckily, amid all the disorder the thief lost his control of my purse, and as he made a break-for-it, my purse dropped to the ground! I quickly snatched it up and for the rest of vacation we walked around with our handbags clutched against our chests!

What a complete failure!""
As time went by, I knew Jack's younger son who grew into an adult, Ernie. He is one of the kindest and most loving men I have ever known. I saw the love between Ernie and his children, thinking that kindness and caring had to come from somewhere. One day, I asked him what his father had done so that he became such a special person.

Context: I called a meeting with the parents of my student, Tommy. I wanted to talk with them about his schoolwork and behaviour .Tommy was always an excellent student. How could I make his father and mother believe that their recent separation  made his grades bad.?
Tommy's mother came in and sat down. Then his father arrived. But they didn't say even one word to each other. I told them about Tommy's schoolwork and behaviour.

He read it and his face became soft . He reached for his wife's hand. She smiled up at him. My eyes were with tears. He helped her with her coat and they left together.

Context: ""Did you hear what happened to Adam last Friday?"" Lindsey whispers to Tori.
With her eyes shining, Tori brags, ""You bet I did. Sean told me two days ago.""
What are Lindsey and Tori talking about? It just happens to be yours truly, Adam Freedman. I can tell you that what they are saying is (a) not nice and (b) not even true. Still, Lindsey and Tori aren't very different from most students here at Linton High School, including me. Many of our conversations are gossip . I have noticed three effects of gossip: it can hurt people, it can give gossipers a strange kind of satisfaction, and it can cause social pressures in a group.
An important negative effect of gossip is that it can hurt the person being talked about. Usually, gossip spreads information about a topic--breakups, troubles at home, even dropping out--that a person would rather keep secret. The more embarrassing or shameful the secret is, the juicer the gossip it makes. Probably the worst type of gossip is the absolute lie. People often think of gossipers as harmless, bur cruel lies can cause pain.
If we know that gossip can be harmful, then why do so many of us do it? The answer lies in another effect of gossip: the satisfaction it gives us. Sharing the latest rumor can make a person feel important because he or she knows something that others don't. Similarly, hearing the latest rumor can make a person feel like part of the ""in group"". In other words, gossip is satisfying because it gives people a sense of belonging or even superiority .
Gossip can also have a third effect: it strengthens unwritten, unspoken rules about how people should act. Professor David Wilson explains that gossip is important in policing behaviors in a group. Translated into high school terms, this means that if everybody you hang around with is laughing at what John wore or what Jane said, then you can bet that wearing or saying something similar will get you the same kind of negative attention. The do's and don'ts conveyed through gossip will never show up in any student handbook.
The effects of gossip vary depending on the situation. The next time you feel the urge to spread the latest news, think about why you want to gossip and what effects your ""juicy story"" might have. 
 Question:What advice does the author give in the passage? 
A. Never become a gossiper. 
B. Stay away from gossipers. 
C. Don't let gossip turn into lies. 
D. Think twice before you gossip.

Context: Three men were travelling across the desert when their car broke down. There were no other traffics, so their only hope was to walk.
Before they set off, they looked around in the car for useful things to take with them. One of the men took a bottle of whisky. Another took an umbrella. The third unscrewed a door from the car and carried that.
After they had been walking for almost a day, they came across a camel caravan travelling towards them.
""Let's try to join the caravan,"" one of the men said. ""It's going the wrong way but we'll be safer than if we keep on alone across the desert.""
The other s agreed, so they asked the leader of the caravan for permission to join it.
""You can join the caravan only if you answer three questions,"" he said. He pointed to the first man's bottle. ""What is that and why are you carrying it?"" he asked.
""It's a bottle of whisky. I decided to carry it with me so that if I feel miserable and want to give up, I can get drunk, cheer myself up and then keep on walking.""
""Very sensible,"" the leader of the caravan said. Then he pointed to the next man and his umbrella.
""It hasn't rained in the desert for many years,"" he said. ""Why are you carrying an umbrella?""
""I don't want to get heat exhaustion,"" he replied. ""The umbrella will give me shade from the sun.""
""Very sensible,"" the leader of the caravan said. He pointed to the third man and his car door. ""And why are you carrying a car door?"" he asked him.

Joining Christine's basketball team was my latest effort to be like her.
On the way to the gym,I'd made up my mind to give my best performance in that day's game.I made preparations with great enthusiasm.""Christine,here!""I tossed her a ball.But it was too high,she leapt for it,it slipped through her fingers and crashed into the tape recorder that was used to play the national anthem before each game.
 I muttered apologies as I picked up the broken pieces of the recorder.Coach looked at the mess and asked,""How are we going to play the song now?""
Christine suggested,""Let Katie sing it!She's always singing at home.""
 Coach asked.""Would you?""I found myself nodding.
     Coach announced the national anthem and everyone stood.Standing before a microphone,I looked up to the flag.The notes seemed to flow from deep inside me,and my voice was steady and clear.When I finished,the gym was silent Then it was filled with applause.As the game started.teammates patted my back and gave me the""thumbs up""sign.Laura Jamison said.""You should try out for the school musical!""I Nodded and said that I might.
 The next morning Hillary Barnes stopped me in the hallway and asked,""Are you the twin who sings?""
""Yes,that's me,""I answered,grining as I walked to class.

Context: All of the people have ambitions. An ambition is something we want to do, want to have, or want to be. A student's ambition, for example, might be to pass his or her exams. An athlete's ambition could be to win an important competition. A businessman's ambition is usually to make a lot of money.
Not all ambitions are about success at work, however. Some people just want to be good people, have a happy family or help others.
Ben's ambition is to be a sports writer. He writes the sports reports for his class newspaper. He likes most sports, but swimming and football are his favorites.
Trudy's ambition is to be a concert pianist. She is very serious about it and practices every day with her best friend Lily. It is very important to her.
Harry's ambition changes every day! One day he wants to be an astronaut. The next day he wants to be a pop singer. Then he wants to drive a racing car. His mother would be happy if his ambition was to get up in time for school every day!
What is your ambition? 
 Question:What does a businessman want? 
A. To pass the exams. 
B. To win a competition.

Context: One day Marilla said, ""Anne, your new teacher, Miss Stacy, spoke to me yesterday. She says you must study for the examinations for Queen's College in two years' time. Then if you do well, you can study at Queen's in Charlottetown for a year, and after that you'll be a teacher!""
""That doesn't matter, Anne. When Matthew and I adopted you three years ago, we decided to look after you as well as we could. Of course we'll pay for you to study.""So in the afternoons Anne and some of her friends stayed late at school, and Miss Stacy helped them with the special examination work. Diana didn't want to go to Queen's, so she went home early, but Gilbert stayed. He and Anne still never spoke and everybody knew that they were enemies, because they both wanted to be first in the examination. Secretly, Anne was sorry that she and Gilbert weren't friends, but it was too late now.
For two years, Anne studied hard at school. She enjoyed learning, and Miss Stacy was pleased with her. But she didn't study all the time. In the evenings and at weekends she visited her friends, or walked through the fields with Diana, or sat talking to Matthew.
""Your Anne is a big girl now. She's taller than you,"" Rachel Lynde told Marilla one day.
""You're right, Rachel!"" said Marilla in surprise.
""And she's a very good girl now, isn't she? She doesn't get into trouble these days. I'm sure she helps you a lot with the housework, Marilla.""
""Yes, I don't know what I'd do without her,"" said Marilla, smiling.
""And look at her! Those beautiful grey eyes, and that red-brown hair! You know, Marilla, I thought you and Matthew made a mistake when you adopted her. But now I see I was wrong. You've looked after her very well.""
""Well, thank you, Rachel,"" replied Marilla, pleased.
That evening, when Matthew came into the kitchen, he saw that his sister was crying.
""What's the matter?"" he asked, surprised. ""You haven't cried since... well, I can't remember when.""
""It's just... well, I was thinking about Anne,"" said Marilla. ""I'll...I'll miss her when she goes away.""
""When she goes to Queen's, you mean? Yes, but she can come home at weekends, on the train.""
""I'll still miss her,"" said Marilla sadly.""
In June the Avonlea boys and girls had to go to Charlottetown to take their examinations.
""Oh, I do hope that I've done well,"" Anne told Diana when she arrived back at Green Gables. ""The examinations were very difficult. And I've got to wait for three weeks before I know! Three weeks! I'll die!""
Anne wanted to do better than Gilbert. But she also wanted to do well for Matthew and Marilla. That was very important to her.
Diana was the first to hear the news, she ran into the kitchen at Green Gables and shouted, ""Look, Anne! It's in Father's newspaper! You're first... with Gilbert... out of all the students on the island! Oh, how wonderful!"" Anne took the paper with shaking hands, and saw her name, at the top of the list of two hundred. She could not speak.
""Well, now, I knew it,"" said Matthew with a warm smile.
""You've done well, I must say, Anne,"" said Marilla, who was secretly very pleased.
For the next three weeks Anne and Marilla were very busy. Anne needs new dresses to take to Charlottetown. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is true?

Context: The murmur of the audience had just faded into expectant silence. This was one of the most important days in little five-year-old Patricia McKee's life: the Kernot School Concert. She stood behind the curtain with her schoolmates. Yet she was not afraid because everyone had been practicing for weeks and knew their parts by heart.
Being in a remote country town, Patricia knew that everyone would turn out for the big occasion-everyone! Yet, it was this awareness that added a sense of sadness to her excitement. There were two people who couldn't be in that audience that night-her mum and dad.
Patricia's mother and father ran the local general store, which was open for business 24 hours. So it was simply accepted that Mum and Dad could never attend community activities. It had been this way with her sister, so why should it be any different for her?
Still, Patricia couldn't help wishing that her mum and dad could be there to see her on such a special day, so she decided to bring up the subject with her mother. Sadly, she had to face the facts. At such a young age, Patricia couldn't really understand the deep pain in her mother's response: ""I'll try to be there, sweetheart, but you know how hard it is for us to get away from the store.""
Yet as the curtain slowly opened on the stage of the Kernot Hall, little Patricia McKee got the surprise of her life. There, sitting four rows the front was her mother with a big smile on her face!
This powerful image remains one of Patricia's most treasured memories. ""Words cannot express the pure joy we both experienced at that moment. I was really _ ,"" said Patricia, now a parent herself. Her parents have passed away, but what a wonderful legacy they've left us: when someone really needs you, be there for them. 
 Question:Why did Patricia have a feeling of sadness? 
A. She had no chance to watch the concert. 
B. She performed unsuccessfully at the concert. 
C. Her parents had gone to a remote country town. 
D. Her parents were unlikely to attend the concert.

Context: Dad had a green comb  .He bought it when he married Mum. Every night,he would hand me his comb and say. ""Good girl, help Daddy clean it, OK?""
I was pleased to do it. At age five, this dull  task brought me such joy. I would excitedly turn the tap  on and brush the comb carefully. Satisfied that I'd done a good job. I would happily return the comb to Dad. He would smile affectionately  at me and place the comb on his wallet.
Two years later. Dad started his own business, which wasn't doing so well. That was when things started to change. Dad didn't come home as early and as much as he used to. Mum and I became mad with him for placing our family in trouble. With time, an uncomfortable silence grew between us.

Context: My friend Alice decided to be a nurse when she was four years old. She always to play at ""doctors and nurses"" with her playmates. When she left school last year, she still wanted to be a real nurse. 
Late September she started her studies in a big hospital in Newcastle. She had to work very hard. She went to classes every day and studied late at night. Then a really important day came: her first day in a ward  . At last she was really helping sick people, not just sitting in classes or learning from books. 
At first, student nurses do lots of odd jobs in the ward. They help to serve meals, or wash the patients. They also keep the ward tidy and make the beds. But they cannot give injections or help the doctors. 
One of Alice's first jobs was in a ward of old people. She was told to clean all the patients' false teeth. She collected all the teeth and took them to the bathroom. Instead of cleaning each set of teeth one by one, she put them all into a big bowl. 
""It'll be quicker this way,"" she said to herself. ""Then I can give back everyone's teeth in a few minutes."" 
Give back everyone's teeth! Alice stood in the middle of the ward with her big bowl of teeth. She had no idea which teeth belonged to which old man! You can imagine the confusion  of the next half-hour when each patient came to find his own teeth!

Context: It was shortly before midnight, and Dr Patricia was getting ready for bed. The phone rang on the end of the line was a woman about to break a promise.
The woman was her mother's neighbour. Flora Harris had made the neighbour swear she wouldn't tell her daughter she'd a heart attack and was in the hospital, for fear her daughter would worry. The neighbour wisely decided to disobey orders.
Harris desperately wanted to get to the hospital immediately, but she couldn't. She lives in Washington, D.C, and her mother lives in California.
For the past year a half, Harris has gone to Los Angeles every other month to take care of her mother. Flora Harris takes care of her husband, James, who's 91 and has Alzheimer's disease. They live in their own home, and a caregiver comes to help them a few hours a day.
Harris is one of many Americans facing the heartache of how to take care of aging parents from afar. She's often worried, not to mention extremely busy with a demanding job, two teenage daughters and the frequent trips to California.
In some ways, Harris is lucky. She has the resources to make the trips to Los Angeles. Plus, Harris is a doctor who treats the elderly.
"" But it's still tough,"" she said. "" I can foresee what the next few years are going to look like, and it's not a pretty picture. My father's going to need diapers  . There will come a time when he won' t recognize me and he's easily excited. I worry he's going to be violent and hurt my mother.""

Context: Many of us enjoy doing it: you turn on the camera on your mobile phone and hold it at a high angle--- making your eyes look bigger and your cheekbones more defined. You turn to your best side and click.
There it is - your selfie.
Over the past year, ""selfie"" has become a well-known term across the globe. This August the Oxford dictionary added the word to their online dictionary and define it as: ""A photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically with a smartphone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website.""
Today it's not difficult to find social networking pages full of photos people have taken of themselves and their friends. And selfie culture has become especially relevant for young people. As many as 91 percent of teenagers have posted photos of themselves online, according to a recent survey by the US Pew Research Center.
So what are the reasons for the rise of selfie culture?
""The craziness about the selfie celebrates regular people,"" Pamela Rutledge, a professor at the Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology, told Vogue magazine. ""There are many more photographs available now of real people than models.""
Posting selfies also allows you to control your image online. ""I like having the power to choose how I look, even if I'm making a funny face:' Samantha Barks, 19, a high school student in the US, told Vogue.
In addition to self-expression and documentation  , selfies ""allow for a close friendship for long-distance friends, because you can see each other's faces every day"", wrote Casey Miller at The Huffington Post.
But US psychologist Jill Weber is concerned that selfies might lead to social problems. ""There's a danger that your self-esteem   may start to be tied to the comments and '1ikes' you get when you post a selfie, and they aren't based on who you are - they're based on what you look like,"" Weber told Vogue. ""When you get nothing or a negative response, your confidence can decrease."" 
 Question:Many people post photos of themselves online to   _  . 
A. make fun of themselves 
B. become powerful 
C. beautify themselves 
D. choose how they look 
 Answer: D
Context: Canadian experts have found that so - called self - help books may actually do more harm than good to people who really need help.Researchers say that individuals   with low respect felt much worse after repeating positive statements about themselves.
In their study, psychologists Joanne Wood and John Lee sought to determine how positive thinking affected people with different levels of self - confidence.They questioned dozens of people both made and female, analyzed their self - worth and optimism by means of the standard psychological methods and then asked them to write down their thoughts and feelings.The scoring system ranged from 0 to 35.
During the experiment, the researchers asked a total of 68 participants to repeat the self-help book phrase, ""I am a lovable person."" After that they measured the participants' moods and their feelings about themselves.The results revealed that the participants in the low self - respect group who repeated the mantra  , were feeling much worse afterwards, when compared to other participants in low self - respect group who did not repeat the phrase.Those with low self - respect who repeated the phrase scored an average of 10 points.Their counterparts   with equally low self - respect who were not asked to repeat the statement, were able to score a little higher average of 17 points.
However, individuals with high self - respect reported feeling better after repeating the positive self - statement - but only slightly.They scored an average of 31 points, compared with an average of 25 for those with equally high self - respect who did not repeat the phrase.
Professor Wood urged those who promote self - help books, magazines and television shows to stop telling people that simply repeating a positive mantra could change one's life.First, people start following this idea and feel like they are not alone.They are told that all they have to do is just to read that book and then to repeat these positive statements in a hope that things will be better, and when it does not work for them and they realize that nothing gets better, then it is really frustration to people.
Researchers concluded: ""Repeating positive self - statements may benefit certain people such as individuals with high self - respect but discourage the very people who need confidence the most."" 
 Question:So - called self - help books do some good to  _  . 
A. people lacking confidence 
B. people with high self - respect 
C. people with problems to settle urgently 
D. people repeating positive self - statements

Context: Zoe Chambers was a successful PR(Public Relations) consultant and life was going well--she had a great job, a beautiful life in London. Then one evening in June last year, she received a text message telling her she was out of work. ""The first two weeks were the most difficult to live through,"" she said. ""After everything I'd done for the company, they dismiss me by text! I was so angry and I just didn't feel like looking for another job. I hated everything about the city and my life.""
Then, Zoe received an invitation from an old school friend, Kathy, to come and stay. Kathy and her husband, Huw, had just bought a farm in north west Wales. Zoe jumped at the chance to spend a weekend away from London, and now, then months later, she is still on the farm.
""The moment I arrived at Kathy's farm, I loved it and I knew I wanted to stay."" said Zoe. ""Everything about my past life suddenly seemed meaningless.""
Zoe has been working on the farm since October of last year and says she has no regrets. ""It's a hard life, physically very tiring."" she says. ""In London I was stressed and often mentally exhausted. But this is a good, healthy tiredness. Here, all I need to put me in a good mood is a hot bath and on of Kathy's wonderful dinners.""
Zoe says she has never bored on the farm. Every day brings a new experience. Kathy has been teaching her how to ride a horse and she has learnt to drive a tractor. Since Christmas, she has been helping with the lambing-watching a lamb being born is unbelievable. She says, ""It's one of the most moving experiences I've ever had. I could never go back to city life now ""

Context: It was unusually quiet in the emergency room on December 25.
I was nurse on duty that day. I didn't think there would be any patients, sighing about having to work on Christmas. Just then five bodies showed up at my desk, a pale woman and four small children.
""Are you all sick?"" I asked suspiciously.
""Yes,"" she said weakly and lowered her head.
But when it came to descriptions of their presenting problems, things got a little vague. Two of the children had headaches, but the headaches weren't accompanied by the normal body language of holding the head or trying to keep it still. Two children had earaches, but only one could tell me which ear was affected. The mother complained of a cough but seemed to work to produce it.
Something was wrong, but I didn't say anything but explained that it might be a little while before a doctor saw her. She responded, ""Take your time; it's warm here.""
On a hunch  , I checked the chart after the admitting clerk had finished registering the family. No address---they were homeless. The waiting room was warm.
I looked out at the family huddled by the Christmas tree. The little one was pointing at the television and exclaiming something to her mother. The oldest one was looking at an ornament on the Christmas tree.
I went back to the nurses' station and mentioned we had a homeless family in the waiting room. The nurses, grumbling about working Christmas, turned to compassion for a family just trying to get warm on Christmas. The team went into action, much as we do when there's a medical emergency. But this one was a Christmas emergency.
We were all offered a free meal in the hospital cafeteria on Christmas Day, so we claimed that meal and prepared a banquet for our Christmas guests. We needed presents. We put together oranges and apples in a basket. We collected from different departments candies, crayons and other things available that could be presents. As seriously as we met the physical needs of the patients that came to us that day, our team worked to meet the needs, and exceed the expectations, of a family who just wanted to be warm on Christmas Day.
Later, as the family walked to the door to leave, the four year old came running back, gave me a hug and whispered, ""Thanks for being our angels today."" 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? 
A. Something was wrong with one of the children's heads. 
B. The pale woman forgot to write the address. 
C. The author did not understand the truth. 
D. The children's mother told a lie. 
 Answer: D
Context: We discuss the issue of when to help a patient die. Doctors of our generation are not newcomers to this question. Going back to my internship days, I can remember many patients in pain, sometimes in coma , with late, hopeless cancer. For many of them, we wrote an order for heavy medication--morphine by the clock. This was not talked about openly and little was written about it. It was essential, not controversial.
The best way to bring the problem into focus is to describe two patients whom I cared for. The first, formerly a nurse, had an automobile accident. A few days later her lungs seemed to fill up; her heart developed dangerous rhythm disturbances. So there she was: in coma, on a breathing machine, her heartbeat maintained with an electrical device. One day after rounds, my secretary said the husband and son of the patient wanted to see me. They told me their wife and mother was obviously going to die; she was a nurse and had told her family that she never wanted this kind of terrible death, being maintained by machines. I told them that while I respected their view, there was nothing deadly about her situation. The kidney  failure she had was just the kind for which the artificial kidney was most effective. While possibly a bit reassured, they were disappointed. Here was the head surgeon seemingly determined to keep everybody alive, no matter what.
Within a few days the patient's pacemaker  could be removed and she awoke from her coma. About six months later, the door of my office opened and in walked a gloriously fit woman. After some cheery words of appreciation, the father and son asked to speak to me alone. As soon as the door closed, both men became quite tearful. All that came out was, ""We want you to know how wrong we were.""
The second patient was an 85-year-old lady whose hair caught fire while she was smoking. She arrived with a deep burn; I knew it would surely be deadly. As a remarkable coincidence there was a meeting for discussion going on at the time in medical ethics . The speaker asked me if I had any sort of ethical problem I could bring up for discussion. I described the case and asked the students their opinion. After the discussion, I made a remark that was, when looking back, a serious mistake. I said, ""I'll take the word back to the nurses about her and we will talk about it some more before we decide."" The instructor and the students were shocked: ""You mean this is a real patient?"" The teacher of ethics was not accustomed to being challenged by actuality. In any event, I went back and met with the nurses. A day or two later, when she was making no progress and was suffering terribly, we began to back off treatment. Soon she died quietly and not in pain. As a reasonable physician, you had better move ahead and do what you would want done for you. And don't discuss it with the world first. There is a lesson here for everybody. Assisting people to leave this life requires strong judgment and long experience to avoid its misuse. 
 Question:The author suggested that doctors  _   before they assist a patient in killing himself. 
A. do what they are wanted to do 
B. discuss with the others about the decision first 
C. be required to do so first by the patient 
D. make sure there is no other choice left

Context: Janice is an American engineer working in Nanjing. She and her husband George, who is teaching English at a university, have been eager to get to know Chinese people better, so they were pleased when Liu, Janice's young co-worker, invited them to her home for dinner.
When they arrived, Liu introduced them to her husband Yang and asked them to sit down at a table containing eight plates of various cold dishes. Half an hour later she came back and sat down and the three began to eat. Yang came in from time to time, putting hot dishes on the table. Most of the food was wonderful, though neither George nor Janice could eat the fatty pork, and there was much more than they could eat. They kept wishing Yang would sit down so they could talk to him. Finally he did sit down to eat a bit, but soon it was time to go home.
Janice and George felt slightly depressed by this experience, but returned the invitation two weeks later. They decided to make a nice American meal and felt lucky to find olives, crackers , tomato juice, and even some cheese in the shop. They put these out as appetizers . For the main course they prepared spaghetti and a salad.

They ate only a little spaghetti and didn't finish the salad on their plates. After a while, George cleared the table and served coffee and pastries . Yang and Liu each put four spoons of sugar into their coffee but didn't drink much of it and ate only a bite or two of pastry.
After they left, George and Janice were upset. "" We left their place so full but they're going to have to eat again when they get home. What went wrong?

Context: There was once a forest made up of tiny trees that were all growing up together. They had been planted by a very old gardener who took care that they would all grow up to be straight and healthy. However, the area was hit by strong winds, and the little trees preferred to avoid the annoying winds, so they bent  their trunks   and branches to protect themselves.
The old man, knowing they could never grow well like this, decided to straighten them out, and spent many hours tying their tiny trunks to supporting poles , hoping his beloved trees would understand he was doing this for their own good. But those naughty trees disliked all the wind. They always avoided the gardener's help by bending themselves, hiding from the wind. One of those trees, one standing right in the middle of the forest, forced itself to grow up straight, patiently bearing the annoying wind.
Three years passed, and the old man died. And from then on the trees could grow however they liked, bending from the wind just as they pleased, with no one bothering them about it. All, that was, except the single straight tree in the center of the forest, who decided to grow up just as a tree should.
But as the forest grew, and the trees got thicker and stronger, they began to hear cracks  from inside. Their branches and trunks needed to keep growing, but the trees were so twisted that the growth they were experiencing only brought them pain and suffering.
And it was a place with a special beauty since, right in its center, surrounded by thousands of short twisted trees, rose one impressive tree that was long and straight like no others. And that tree, the only one that never cracked, continued growing, without a worry for the changeable wind. 
 Question:How long did the old gardener look after the trees? 
A. Two years. 
B. Three years. 
C. Four years. 
D. Five years. 
 Answer: B
Context: Modern man has cleared the forests for farmland and for wood, and has also carelessly burned them. More than that, though, he has also interfered   with the invisible bonds between the living things in the forests. There are many examples of this kind of destruction. The harmfulness of man's interference can be seen in what happened many years ago in the forest of the Kaibab plateau   of northern Arizona. Man tried to improve on the natural web of forest life and destroyed it instead.
The Kaibab had a storybook forest of large sized pine, Douglas fir, white fir, blue and _ . In 1882 a visitor noted, ""We, who ... have wandered through its forests and parks, have come to regard it as the most enchanting region it has ever been our privilege   to visit."" This was also the living place of the Rocky Mountain mule deer. Indians hunted there every autumn to gather meat and skins. The forest also had mountain lions, timber wolves and bobcats that kept the deer from multiplying too rapidly.
Then, in 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt made the Kaibab a national game preserve. Deer hunting was forbidden. Government hunters started killing off the deer's enemies. In 25 years' time, 6,250 mountain lions, wolves and bobcats were killed. Before the program, there were about 4,000 deer in the Kaibab, by 1924, there were about 100,000.
The deer ate every leaf and twig they could reach. But there was not nearly enough food. Hunting of deer was permitted again. This caused a slight decrease in the deer herd  ,but a far greater loss resulted from starvation   and disease. Some 60 percent of the deer herd died in two winters. By 1930 the herd had dropped to 20,000 animals. By 1942 it was down to 8,000. 
 Question:The destruction of the environment of the Kaibab resulted from  _ 
A. interfering with natural cycle of forest life 
B. turning the forest into cultivated land 
C. forest fires caused by man's carelessness 
D. cutting the trees for building materials

Context: Move over Psy. There's a new viral music video on the Internet that's getting millions of people dancing and laughing. Psy is a singer who created Gagnam Style, a music video which featured a catchy tune and interesting dance.
The new music video called The Fox (What does the fox say?) has recently gone viral. At     123 000 000 views, it may even catch up to Gagnam Style. The video asks the question, ""What does the fox say?"" It's a good question. And it seems, at least according to the music video, there is no good answer.
Actors in the video dress up like the animals they're singing about. One of the brothers dresses up like a fox. There is a surprising and silly dance in the video that takes the viewer a bit _ . The video's appeal is the song's simple rhythm and catchy chorus  .
The makers of the video never expected the video to do well or even to be taken seriously. In fact, it started out as a joke. The song was written by two brothers from Norway, Vegard and Bard Ylvis ker. The brothers have their own late-night talk show in Norway. They thought the video would be so bad that it would give them something to talk about on their show.
On their website, they say the video was ""supposed to entertain a few Norwegians for three minutes -- and that's all."" But people started loving it. Some people say that once you listen to the delightfully silly song, you want to listen to it again and again.
The brothers have been guests on some major North American talk shows. They say they're happy about the success of their video, but they know that tomorrow something else could come along and be even bigger. 
 Question:Which of the following best describes the new music video The Fox? 
A. It can catch the viewers' heart easily by its amusing tune and dance. 
B. It features the same story with the music video Gagnam Style. 
C. It answers the question ""What does the fox say?"" exactly. 
D. It has the real animals in the video.

Context: Rahfeal Gordon has come a long way from the homeless shelters and streets of Newark, New Jersey. The 25-year-old was honored this year by the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship for his work----giving motivational speeches to youth groups.
Rahfeal Gordon tells his audience, ""If nobody ever says that you're brilliant, say it to yourself every day. Look yourself in the mirror: if you have survived something, I don't care how small, how big, you've survived it,"" he said.
Rahfeal Gordon 's speech is simple: He tells the story of his own life in three chapters. Each begins with a hip hop lyric   that he knows will be meaningful to a young audience.
Gordon says he uses positive hip hop lyrics to encourage youths, especially those who grew in poverty and abuse, as he did. His talk is called ""Hip Hop Saved My Life"".
"" When I had my very dark moments in life, I would put on certain songs, whether it is from Jay-Z , Tupac, Kanye West,"" Gordon said. ""They kept me going through the hard times. They fulfilled a certain void   that I couldn't fulfill, like not having a father or mother there, so I felt they could relate because they would tell these stories.""
Gordon says his childhood was happy until his father became addicted to drugs and began to beat his three brothers and mother. They left to live on the streets and in homeless shelters. Gordon says he tries now to be a voice for others, including a brother who was murdered at the age of 19. 
""When I lost my brother, that was, really, a moment when things really started to take off, in the sense of saying, 'I really, really want to be that individual to help people, to help individuals,' ""Gordon said. ""I can't be Superman. I can't save the world, but I think that if I can help an individual, I am saving the world. "" 
 Question:The author writes the passage mainly to  _  . 
A. share Rahfeal Gordon's life story 
B. tell readers to follow Rahfeal Gordon 
C. introduce an American national award 
D. direct readers' attention to poor children

Context: One day,Mr.Arnold was teaching a lesson,and things were going as normally as ever.He was explaining the story of mankind to his pupils.He told them that,in the beginning,men were nomads ;they never stayed in the same place for very long.Instead,they would travel about,here and there,in search of food,wherever it was to be found. And when the food ran out,they would move off somewhere else.
He taught them about the invention of farming and keeping animals.This was an important discovery,because by learning to cultivate the land,and care for animals,mankind would always have food steadily available.It also meant that people could remain living in one place,and this made it easier to set about tasks that would take a long while to complete,like building towns,cities,and all that were in them.All the children listening were attracted by this story,until Lucy jumped up:
""And if that was so important and improved everything so much,why are we nomads all over again,Mr.Arnold?""
Mr.Arnold didn't know what to say. Lucy was a very intelligent girl.He knew that she lived with her parents in a house,so she must know that her family were not nomads;so what did she mean?
""We have all become nomads again,"" continued Lucy.""The other day,outside the city,they were cutting the forest down. A while ago a fisherman told me how they fish.It's the same with everyone:when there's no more forest left, the foresters go elsewhere,and when the fish run out, the fishermen move on.That's what the nomads did,isn't it?""
The teacher nodded,thoughtfully. Really,Lucy was right. Mankind had turned into nomads. Instead of looking after the land in a way that we could be sure it would keep supplying our needs,we kept developing it until the land was bare.And then off we would go to the next place!            The class spent the rest of the afternoon talking about what they could do to show how to be more civilized.
The next day everyone attended class wearing a green Tshirt,with a message that said,""I am not a nomad!""
And,from then on,they set about showing that indeed they were not.Every time they knew they needed something,they made sure that they would get it using care and control.If they needed wood or paper,they would make sure that they got the recycled kind.They ordered their fish from fish farms,making sure that the fish they received were not too young and too small.They only used animals that were well cared for,and brought up on farms.
And so,from their little town,those children managed to give up being nomads again,just as prehistoric men had done so many thousands of years ago. 
 Question:The writer tries to make us believe that  _  .

B. it's unwise for mankind to use the land in an uncontrolled way

He needed money for his travels and for his zoo, and a little oil would buy enough water for what he needed all his life, but he knew that if he told anyone else about it, it would be the end of his zoo and his life's work.

Context: Many jobs must be done with two people. One person takes the lead. The other helps. So it is with the human body. Much of our body depends on the cooperation between substances. When they work together, chemical reactions take place smoothly. Body systems are kept in balance.
Some of the most important helpers in the job of good health are the substances we call vitamins. The word ""vitamin"" dates back to Polish scientist Casimir Funk in 1912. He was studying a substance in rice. Funk believed the substance belonged to a group of chemicals known as amines  . He added the Latin word ""vita"", meaning life. So he called the substance a ""vitamine""--an amine necessary for life.
Other studies found that not all vitamins were amines. So the name was shortened to vitamin. But Funk was correct in recognizing their importance.
Scientists have discovered 14 kinds of vitamins. They say vitamins help to carry out chemicals changes within cells. If we do not get enough of the vitamins, we are at risk of developing a number of diseases. _ brings us back to James Lind of Scotland. In the 1740s, Lind was a doctor for the British Navy. He was investigating a problem that had existed in the Navy for many years.
The problem was the disease scurvy . The sailors were weak from bleeding inside their bodies. Even the smallest wound would not heal. Doctor Lind thought the sailors were getting sick because they failed to eat some kinds of foods when they were at sea for many months.
Doctor Lind separated twelve sailors who had scurvy into two groups. He gave each group different foods to eat. One group got oranges and lemons. The other did not. The men who ate the fruit began to improve within seven days. The other men got weaker.
However, which foods should be eaten to keep us healthy? Let us look at some important vitamins for these answers. 
 Question:Why was the name ""vitamine"" shortened to ""vitamin""? 
A. Because Funk was totally wrong. 
B. Because few vitamins were amines. 
C. Because there were new findings. 
D. Because the latter was easy to remember. 
 Answer: C
Context: The vitamins   are named by letters of the alphabet  . Vitamin A is needed by the eyes. There is Vitamin A in milk, butter, and green vegetables. It can be kept by the body.
Vitamin B cannot be kept. It must be supplied all the time by some of the food we eat.
Vitamin C is very important to the body. Without it men's teeth become loose   and their arms and legs get weak. Lemons  , oranges and tomatoes have Vitamin C in them.
Vitamin D is the sun vitamin. We get it in milk and eggs and from sunlight on our skin  . There are other Vitamins, but these A, B, C and D, are the most important. 
 Question:If somebody is near-eye sighted probably he needs   _  . 
A. Vitamin A 
B. Vitamins A and C 
C. Vitamin D 
D. Vitamin B

Context: Barack Obama has never been shy about comparing himself with Abraham Lincoln. He did so when he announced his presidential election in Illinois, where both he and Lincoln served in the legislature  . ""The life of a tall, thin, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible."" Obama said. ""He tells us that there is power in words and that there is power in hope."" Such comparisons have continued on big and small occasions, but the most important similarity, in Obama's mind, is how he plans to govern if elected.
Obama says he admires Doris Kearns Goodwin' s wonderful Lincoln biography, Team of Rivals. ""He talks about it all the time."" says a top assistant. ""He is particularly interested in the idea that Lincoln successfully won the hearts of many people who had run against him for President, some of them even disagree with him firmly."" ""The lesson is that you shouldn't let your hatred   get in the way of hiring  ly the best people."" says Obama. ""I think American people are practical and so I have an interest in casting a wide net, seeking out people with a wide range of expert knowledge, including Republicans, for the highest positions in the government.""
""I don't want to have people who just agree with me."" He says. ""I want people who are continually pushing me forward and I'd be very interested in having those sorts of Republicans in my government, especially people who can speed up a responsible and logical conclusion to the Iraq war."" 
 Question:What can we infer from the passage? 
A. Obama is a member of the Republicans. 
B. The passage was written after the presidential election. 
C. Doris Goodwin is one of Obama's assistants. 
D. In the end Lincoln was able to get the support of the people who once hated him.

Context: What could make Michael Jordon, one of the greatest basketball players in history, shed tears?  It was when he became a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame on September 11. The hall is in Springfield, Massachusetts and honors the best basketball players, greatest coaches and other contributors to the game. ""The game of basketball has been everything to me ,"" said Jordan, 46. ""It is the place I have always gone when I needed to find comfort and peace.""
Jordan retired twice in his 15-year career, finishing with 32292 points, the third highest total points in NBA history behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone. His average of 30.12 points a game is the best in the League.
""One day you might look up and see me playing the game at 50,"" Jordan said. ""Because limits, like fears, are often just an illusion.""   In other words, it was motivation that made Jordan such a success..
A great career did not mean a smooth one. His high school coach cut him from the team in favor of a taller player when Jordan was in 10thgrade. His college coach wouldn't allow him on the cover of Sports Illustration in 1981 with North Carolina's four other players because Jordan was a freshman. In his first NBA All-Star game, older NBA stars wouldn't throw him the ball because of jealousy.
""That burned me up,"" Jordan said. ""But _ don't have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it."" 
 Question:When Jordan became a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame,  _ 
A. he found something more encouraging . 
B. he was so excited that he couldn't hold his tears back. 
C. he was happy and sad at the same time. 
D. he felt very comfortable and peaceful. 
 Answer: B
Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""
It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on. 
 Question:What can we learn from this passage? 
A. Jordan is not such a great person. 
B. Jordan deserves the admiration he had from others. 
C. Jordan is always ready to make friends with young people. 
D. Jordan is always misunderstood by expert reviewers.

Context: Police Officer Tidwell left the station just after 8 a.m.on Sunday June 4.He had spent aboring night on duty and was looking forward to his day of rest.By habit he took a short-cutdown the path behind Dugby Hall road and after a minute or two he saw a man climbing down a drainpipe   from an open bedroom window of Number 29.In silence,Tidwell crept into the garden.The man reached the ground and was dusting himself down when he felt his arm caught.
""It's 8:15 on a Sunday morning,""said the officer,""and this sort of thing seems an unlikely adventure at such a time.Would you mind explaining?""
The man was obviously scared but tried to keep calm.He said,""I know what you are thinking,officer,but it isn't true.This is a funny mistake.""
""It's part of my job to take an interest in unusual events.I think you've just left this house in a manner other than the customary one.That may be quite innocent,but I'd like to make sure.""Tidwell took out his notebook and a pen.""Name,address and occupation and then,please,tell me your story...""
""Charlie Crane,lorry driver,from Nottingham,51 Breton Street.My story...""
""Yes.What were you doing like a fly on that wall,Mr.Crane?""
""Well,I had a breakdown yesterday and had to stay the night here.Bed and breakfast.Theland-lady's name is Mrs.Fern.She gave me breakfast at seven,and I was out of here in the right way and down at the lorry by half past seven.Only when I felt around for a cigarette did I realize I'd left$80in my envelope under the pillow here at number 29.I always put it under my pillow at night.It's a habit I've got into.I even do it at home...""
""I see.Why didn't you miss it when you went to pay Mrs...What's her name?""
""I'd paid her last night.You've got to pay when you take the room,see?So I came rushing back,but it's Sunday,and she'd gone back to bed,and could I wake her?I rang the bell and banged on the front door for ten minutes before I came round here to the back and spotted my bedroom window still open.Up I went,then,up this pipe.It's a trick I learned in the army.She didn't make the bed,and money was still there.You know the rest,I hope you believe it because...""
""Mr.Crane,whatever are you doing here?I thought you'd gone an hour ago.""It was Mrs.Fern,speaking from the kitchen at the corner of the house.

Context: Dear Mr. Barton,
I am writing for the _   to inform you of our feelings about your act. We've really had enough of you. Although we have tried to speak to you politely on several occasions, you have always answered with a stream of verbal abuse .
Ever since you moved in three months ago, you have shown very little consideration for the other residents of this building, though many residents expressed their unhappiness with you. For the past six weekends, you have held very noisy parties, which have not finished until early the next morning. As you know, most of the people here are elderly or have very young children, and the noise keeps them awake all night. You don't have to be so noisy, do you? Last weekend the situation _ when two of your friends fought with each other on the first floor. The fighting was so bad that the police had to be called. What's more, your friends left the stairs in a terrible state --- they even broke two windows on their way out! We feel that we can't bear this type of act.
We strongly demand that you pay for this damage to the window soon. If you don't and you carry on being a nuisance . We will kick you out! Legal steps will be taken if necessary.
Yours sincerely 
 Question:Why were the police called? 
A. Because Mr. Barton broke two windows. 
B. Because Mr. Barton made too much noise. 
C. Because Mr. Barton's friends fought. 
D. Because Mr. Barton beat a child and an old man.

Context: Students who get tired of looking at the four walls of a classroom might like to take the nature course being offered by Carvel College again this summer. Groups of about a dozen students each, led by an experienced guide, will go on ten-day camping trips to the mountains to study the plants and animals that grow and live there.
Students carry their own things, which includes sleeping bags, warm clothing, food and water, and other useful tools. And what do the students do all day? Well, as soon as the sun comes up, they eat breakfast and start climbing up the mountain trail to the next campground, which is five to ten miles away. As the students take notes, the guide points out different plants and animals alongside the trail. The climb is usually over by early afternoon, so the group spends the rest of the day resting or swimming in a mountain lake. Before dinner each night, they all come together and discuss the day's activities.
At the end of the course, the students write reports using the information they have collected. But they don't mind at all. What they do mind is leaving the beauty of the wilderness and the good friends they've made to return to their normal lives in the city. 
 Question:What do the students have to do before dinner? 
A. Wash themselves up in a mountain lake. 
B. Attend classes by the experienced guide. 
C. Write about what they see along the trail. 
D. Review what they learn through discussion. 
 Answer: D
Context: What do we do when we go camping? First, we think of a plan. We take food, clothes, a knife, and things for cooking and eating. We take things to keep us away from insects and the sun. Then we put everything into the car and we drive to the woods. We look for a place for campers   and we look for a good place for our tent . The place should have a lot of air. This will keep some insects   away. High land with water on both sides of it is good. Then we put up our tent. We put everything into the tent, and we are ready for fun. We can swim in the lake, walk in the woods, climb a mountain, row a boat, or go fishing. In the evening we come back to the tent, we build a big fire because it can keep the insects away. We sit around the fire and talk. We may tell interesting stories or we may sing songs. At night we lie down on the grass. We can look up at the stars. It is a busy day, so we try to go to sleep early. Everything is dark. Everything is quiet. We hope we won't hear music from the radio in the next tent. We hope it won't rain. 
 Question:We go to camp   _  . 
A. by bus 
B. by car 
C. by bike 
D. on foot

Context: When doctors urge overweight kids to pick up more activities,reading probably isn't what they have in mind.    Yet a new study by fatness researchers at Duke University finds that the simple act of reading--depending on the choice of material--can cause weight loss in teenage girls.
The study's experimental group included 31 fat girls aged 9 to 13,who took part in the Healthy Lifestyles Program at Duke Children's Hospital. The girls read a novel called Lake Rescue,whose protagonist   is an overweight teenager who struggles with low selfesteem,feelings of loneliness and teasing because of her size. A group of 33 girls read a different book called Charlotte in Paris,which did not have an overweight character,and another group of 17 girls read neither book.
At the end of the sixmonth experiment,all the girls who read books had lost weight,but the girls who read Lake Rescue lost more. They lowered their body mass index (BMI) by 0.71,compared with 0.33 in the Charlotte group,an average 0.05 increase among the nonreaders.
The idea behind the study,says Dr Sarah Armstrong,director of Healthy Lifestyles,was to find a way to encourage the girls without adopting the restrictive and often authoritative voice of so many other nutrition and diet programs. Lake Rescue was the perfect instrument,says Armstrong;it presents a likable character to whom the girls could relate and whom they could learn from. As the book progresses,its protagonist learns to make healthier lifestyle choices and finds an adviser to help keep her on track. Armstrong says,"" _ learns that she can become healthier,and the 'I can do it' feeling resonates   with the teenage girls."" 
 Question:In which part of a newspaper can we read the above passage?

I was ready to cry. In despair, I crossed the street on to an ""island"", where I found a policeman. I took my last bit of courage in both hands and said, ""Please, sir, where is Addison Road?"" He began to explain, but when he saw that I couldn't understand he became helpless, too. ""Are you French at school?"" A few minutes later, he smiled and raised his hand. How wonderful!

Context: Americans plan parties for many reasons. As in other cultures, many Americans attend parties for weddings and religious or national holidays. But some parties are especially American. For example, a group of neighbors may gather on their street to eat food, play music and visit with one another. This is called a block party. A woman might invite a group of women to a party called a baby shower for a friend who is about to give birth. Guests bring presents for the new baby.
Americans also attend tailgate parties. A tailgate is the back end of a truck or other vehicle that opens down. The tailgate parties are a big part of sports culture in the United States. Friends bring food and drink to a sports event. They eat together in the parking area of the sports stadium.
Birthday parties are also very popular. Many parents organize a party for their child around a theme. Birthday parties usually include gifts and a birthday cake with candles. In many parts of the United States, cupcakes have become a popular replacement for cakes.
Birthday parties can be low cost or very costly. Some parents take their children's birthday parties very seriously, even when the child is too young to fully understand the celebration.
One group of parents started a website called Birthdays Without Pressure. They decided that some parents were under too much social pressure to plan costly parties for their children. The group sees this movement as an example of America's culture of ""too much stuff"". The group's website gives suggestions on how to keep birthday celebrations simple, meaningful and fun without spending a lot of money. Their advice may be very helpful during this period of economic recession  . 
 Question:The purpose of Birthdays Without Pressure is to advise people to   _  . 
A. relieve people's pressure 
B. have meaningful birthday parties with low cost 
C. make birthday parties meaningful and costly 
D. spread America's culture

Are the lives of city kids the same as those in villages? In many ways, they are very different. But what are the differences?
Hu Peng of Wuhan and four friends decided to find them out. Earlier this month, they lived for a week in Caidian, a village near Wuhan. Hu and his friends went door to door in Caidian and asked the kids there lots of questions. They wanted to learn more about village kids' everyday lives, so they asked these questions like --Do your parents teach you how to do housework? How much money do you usually spend on dinner? What would you do if a thief   came into your house? They also asked 150 city kids the same questions.What's the Difference?
Last week the team gave a report to their class. There are lots of differences between children's lives in cities and those in villages. The biggest difference is independence. Hu's team said that 60 percent of city kids couldn't do much housework, but 90 percent of village kids could care for themselves.
City kids told Hu they cared about school a lot, and they had no time for washing clothes or making their beds. Village kids said they helped their parents with housework a lot. They cooked, did some cleaning and fed animals. Hu's team also found that village kids had less pocket money  . Many never used computers. They played in rivers or on mountains. Some didn't really like to make new friends.
Hu and his friends said their trip gave them more self-confidence   because they were doing something by themselves. But _ also made them a little worried because they saw they still had a lot to learn. ""When we grow up, our parents can't take care of us,"" said Hu. ""We have to learn to take care of ourselves."" Shen Guanquan, one of Hu's friends said, ""When children learn to care for themselves, they learn to do lots of things."" 
 Question:How many city kids went to learn about village kids' everyday lives? 
A. Three. 
B. Four.

Context: An 18-year-old girl Anna Meier from Austria is taking her parents to court for posting over 500 photos of her on Facebook since 2009,without her permission.
Anna has apparently become fed up with her parents' refusal to take down the embarrassing photos of her at an early age,and is now seeking justice in court.She told the magazine that even though she was 11 years old when her parents started sharing her photos with several hundreds of Facebook friends,they went as far as to post pictures of her as a baby,without ever asking if it was alright with her.""They knew no shame and no limit--and didn't care whether it was a picture of me sitting on the toilet or lying naked in my bed--every stage was photographed and then made public,""the girl said.
The girl added that she was only able to see the photos posted on Facebook by her parents  when she was 14,after setting up her own account on it.Again and again,Anna asked her parents to remove the photos of her immediately,but they refused.Angry and upset,she felt that she had no other way but to take them to court,which she did as soon as she turned 18 this year.""I'm tired of not being taken seriously by my parents,""she said.
Anna's lawyer claims they have a good chance of winning the case in court,if it can be  proven that the images have violated  her rights to a personal life.But,based on similar cases and according to Austrian privacy laws,if the parents lose,they may be forced to pay their daughter a fine of EUR 3,000 to EUR10,000.
But Anna's parents,however,see nothing wrong with posting baby photos of her.""I consider it my right to publish these photos,""her father said. ""We have posted no more photos of our daughter since she stopped allowing us to photograph her.We also have baby photos of her that can only be seen by a limited group of 700 Facebook friends.""
It's reported that Anna has moved out of her parents' home and is living with some girls in a rented apartment. 
 Question:What can we infer from the passage? 
A. The girl will surely win the case in court. 
B. The girl and her parents have made peace. 
C. The author supports the girl accusing her parents.

Context: Two good friends, Sam and Jason, met with a car accident on their way home one snowy night. The next morning, Sam woke up blind. His legs were broken.

Thank you very much for doing the special operation ."" Mr Lee was moved by Sam. When he was leaving, Sam said, ""Please don't tell Jason about it."" ""Well...Well...OK,"" Mr Lee replied.

Context: Each week, this program explains the many meanings of English expressions. Today's expressions include a very important word--""heart"". We will try to ""get to the heart of the matter"" to better understand the most important thing about words and their stories. So ""take heart."" Have no fear about learning new expressions. Besides, popular English words can be fun. There is no need for a ""heavy heart."" Such feelings of sadness would only ""break my heart,"" or make me feel unhappy and hopeless.
Now, let us suppose you and I were speaking freely about something private. We would be having a ""heart to heart"" discussion. I might speak from ""the bottom of my heart, "" or say things honestly and truthfully. I might even ""open up my heart"" to you and tell you a secret. I would speak with ""all my heart"".
When a person shares her feelings freely and openly like this, you might say she ""wears her heart on her sleeve"". Her emotions are not protected.
If we had an honest discussion, both of us would know that the other person's ""heart is in the right place."" For example, I would know that you are a ""kind-hearted"" and well-meaning person. And, if you are a very good person, I would even say that you have ""a heart of gold."" However, you might have a ""change of heart"" based on what I tell you. Our discussion might cause you to change the way you feel about something.
But, let us suppose you get angry over what I tell you. Or worse, you feel no sympathy or understanding for me or my situation. If this happens, I might think that you have a ""heart of stone."" And, if you say something to make me frightened or worried, my ""heart might stand still"". 
 Question:From the above passage we may see   _  . 
A. English words can all be used differently 
B. some phrases do not have a fixed meaning 
C. languages change with the time

Context: In ancient Egypt, the pharaoh treated the poor message runner like a prince when he arrived at the palace, if he brought good news. However, if the exhausted  runner had the misfortune to bring the pharaoh unhappy news, his head was cut off
Shades of that spirit spread over today's conversations. Once a friend and I packed up some peanut, butter and sandwiches for an outing. As we walked light-heartedly out the door, picnic basket in hand, a smiling neighbor looked up at the sky and said, ""Oh boy, bad day for a picnic. The weatherman says it's going to rain."" I wanted to strike him in the face with the peanut butter and sandwiches. Not for his stupid weather report, but for his smile.
Several months ago I was racing to catch a bus. As I breathlessly put my handful of cash across the Greyhound counter, the sales agent said with a broad smile. ""Oh that bus left five minutes ago."" Dreams of head cutting!
It's not the news that makes someone angry. It's the unsympathetic attitude with which it's delivered. Everyone must give bad news from time to time, and winning professionals do it with the proper attitude. A doctor advising a patient that she needs an operation does it in a caring way. A boss informing an employee he didn't get the job takes on a sympathetic tone. Big winners know, when delivering any bad news, they should share the feeling of the receiver.
Unfortunately, many people are not aware of this. When you're tired from a long flight, has a hotel clerk cheerfully said that your room isn't ready yet? When you had your heart set on the toast beef, has your waiter merrily told you that he just served the last piece? It makes you, as traveler or diner, want to land your fist fight on their unsympathetic faces.
Had my neighbor told me of the upcoming rainstorm with sympathy, I would have appreciated his warning. Had the Greyhound salesclerk sympathetically informed me that my bus had already left, I probably would have said, ""Oh, that's all right. I'll catch the next one."" Big winners, when they hear bad news, deliver bombs with the emotion thebombarded  person is sure to have . 
 Question:What is the main idea of the text? 
A. Delivering bad news properly is important in communication. 
B. Helping others sincerely is the key to business success. 
C. Receiving bad news requires great courage. 
D. Learning ancient traditions can be useful. 
 Answer: A
Context: Danger-junkie orangutans  in Borneo climb dead trees and shake then until they begin to fall. They scream with excitement as they cling to the falling tree. Just before the tree hits the ground the orangutans leap to another tree or vine, narrowly escaping death. While no one cab ask orangutans if they enjoy it as a person playing an extreme sport, one animal behaviorist sees this monkey fun as a bit of harmless thrill-seeking.
A growing number of scientists agree that animals are conscious and capable of experiencing basic emotions , such as happiness, sadness, boredom or depression. A few scientists even see the possibility for higher animal emotions like love, jealousy and spite.
Five years ago, behaviorist and animal-rights activist Dr. Jonathan Balcombe stood on a Virginia hotel balcony watching two crows intimately groom   each other in the comfort of an abandoned billboard. He felt that the birds liked what they were doing, even if engaged in a natural, beneficial act, such as picking parasites   off the other's feathers. That moment changed the way he would view animals forever and led to a book, ""Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good"", which is filled with hundreds of examples of animals living it up thanks to developed senses of touch, taste, sight, sound and smell.
Balcombe recounts a favorite example of Kenyan hippos   having high-end spa treatment in a fresh water spring. They splay their toes, open their mouths wide and wait for a school of cleaner fish to remove parasites and slough off dead skin, he recalls. Balcombe knows that the hippos and the fish both benefit from this arrangement. ""My interpretation is that it is also enjoyable for them ,"" he says. 
 Question:We can conclude from the passage that   _  . 
A. only a few animals have emotions 
B. Balcombe's theory is not supported by other scientists 
C. Balcombe has watched a lot of animals showing emotions 
D. Balcombe can understand animal language

Context: The prisoner had waited many months for help, but none had come. Now he felt he would do something to gain his freedom, to be free again to go about the world as he wished. But he could think of no way to run away.
He spent many hours thinking of his life before he was captured, regretting the mistakes he had made and dreaming of the joys he had known. And over and over he said to himself that he was being punished for no reason. He was guilty of no crime, but he had not been given a chance to explain the events which made him guilty.
Then one night the guard who sat outside the prisoner's door fell asleep. When he noticed this, the prisoner was struck by a feeling of hope. Perhaps he could steal the keys while the guard was sleeping.
Silently the prisoner moved toward the guard. Very gently he lifted the ring of keys from the guard's belt. Then he turned and crawled toward the door. Could he work the lock from the inside? The key turned and the door was opened. Within two minutes he had crossed the yard and climbed the wall. Then he ran across the field, free at last, a smile of joy beginning to spread across his face.

A. to be excused 
B. to go away freely with his family 
C. to be a free man in the prison

Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""
It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on. 
 Question:That man called after reading about what Jordan did to a disabled child because he wanted to   _  . 
A. become famous himself 
B. know why Jordan appeared in a poor area 
C. let the author know that Jordan was not that nice 
D. offer another example to show that Jordan was a nice man

Context: Tyler was a troublesome student. He sat in the back row. Every time I called him to answer questions, he'd reply with a flip answer. If he got it wrong, he would get very angry.
Usually kids could sit quietly in class. However, Tyler was just loud. One day, Tyler was talking while I was teaching. I said to him, ""Tyler, why not join in our discussion instead of having one of your own?"" He got up from his chair, pushed it over, and shouted something I can't remember. I sent him to the office and he received a week's out-of-school punishment.
The week was a wonderful time for me, but when it came to an end, I began to feel worried. So I came up with a plan. On the day of his return, I told him I wanted to start over with him. If he felt like he was going to lose control in class, he could step outside the door for a moment.
From then on, Tyler was a changed student in my classroom. In fact he was a smart child and he even stopped a fight between two students one day. And he never used the privilege to leave the class for a moment. I believe that just letting him decide for himself made all the difference.
When the year was over, he wrote me a thank-you note about how good the year had been for him. I still have it today and find it very moving to reread when I get stressed about teaching. 
 Question:Tyler did all the following things EXCEPT  _  . 
A. sitting in the back row 
B. leaving the class for a moment 
C. stopping a fight between two students 
D. not listening to teachers in class

Context: Nate suffered a devastating blow when he lost his job. His boss had spoken rudely, ""Your services are no longer needed."" Nate left the building filled with despair . By the time he reached home, he was in a deep depression. When he entered his house, he blurted  out to his wife Sophia, ""I lost my job. I am a complete, utter failure."" A tense silence  followed. Then a smile crept  across Sophia's face. ""What great news!"" she responded. ""Now you can write the book you have always wanted to write.""""But I have no job and no prospect (hope) of a job,"" he objected  , completely without hope . ""If I struggle to be an author, then what will we live on? Where will the money come from?"" Sophia took her husband by the hand and led him to the kitchen, opening a drawer; she took out a box that was full of cash . ""Where on earth did you get this?"" Nate gasped. ""To whom does it belong?""
""It's ours!"" Sophia replied . ""I always knew that one day you would become a great writer if only you were given the chance. From the money you gave me for housekeeping every week, I have saved as much as I could so you would have your chance. Now there is enough to last us a whole year.""
What a surprise! What encouragement! What a wife! The unemployed  husband did concentrate on writing that year, and the novel he wrote became a literary masterpiece . The book is The Scarlet Letter.

Context: Once upon a time, there were two doors in a house. One was a beautiful living room door, and the other was just a normal bathroom door.
There were some naughty children in the house, and they always kicked  the door. The living room door was always very angry about it and hated the children. The bathroom door didn't care too much when the children kicked him. Instead, he tried to comfort the living room door. He said, ""Don't worry. It's normal. They're children, and they'll grow up soon. Before long, things will be better.""
One day, the living door finally lost his temper . A child kicked him, and he broke at once. The owner of the house got very angry and told the children to be careful next time. This made the living door happy. However, the owner didn't repair him; he threw him into a landfill  instead. At the same time, the bathroom door took the place of the living room door. And the children treated him with greater care.
The living room door realized his mistake. He shouldn't treat young children like that. He should learn to forgive  others. The happiness from revenge  will never last for long. 
 Question:The writer wants to tell us that   _  .

B. we should treat children kindly 
C. we should treat the doors in different ways

Context: Bobbi Kristina Brown's family has been gathered around her since she was hospitalized on Saturday after being found unconscious in the bathtub of her suburban Atlanta townhome.
Whitney Houston's only child is now at Emory University Hospital and is still fighting for her life, as a family statement said on Monday.
Nothing has changed, despite reports that are popping up and painting a more serious picture.
Fox News reported Wednesday that the situation is horrific. ""It's now a matter of when the family wants to let go and accept that she's pretty much not going to make it,"" a source told FOX411. ""They've left it up to the family as to how long they want to keep her alive.""
People Magazine is also reporting that a doctor told Brown's family on Wednesday that nothing more could be done. ""Everyone is coming to the hospital to say goodbye,"" said a family member.
And the Daily Mail says Brown has been taken off life support.
But Bobby Brown issued a statement late Thursday denying these reports.
""If we issued a statement every time the media published a false report regarding this matter, that's all we would be doing 24 hours a day. This is false, just as is the vast majority of the other reporting that is currently taking place,"" he said, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.
A source close to the family tells USA TODAY that it's wrong to say the family is gathering to say goodbye, because the family has been there since the beginning, so nothing is any different today for them.
Also, Brown is ""not brain dead,"" as has been reported.
And, as for other stories saying that the Houston family is feuding with Bobbi Kristina's dad, Bobby Brown? Those aren't true either. They ""are NOT fighting,"" says our source. 
 Question:Which can be the best title of the passage? 
A. An Accident In The Bathtub 
B. Kristina, We're Still Praying And Waiting On A Miracle 
C. False Reports From Different News Media 
D. Bobbi Kristina's Final Days

Context: Good evening,ladies and gentlemen and welcome to this of the Box Bill Tennis Club. It's good to see so many of you here this evening. I'm sure you're all enjoyed the fine food,and that you are ready to hear our guest speaker. 
Ladies and gentlemen,we're pleased to welcome our most famous club champion,Billy Rogers,to our meeting. 
Billy needs no introduction because he is one of the most well-known tennis players in our country. However,I must mention a few things about him. Billy has won the US Open three times,and Wimbledon twice. He has won more tennis tournaments than any player from this country. He has been ranked number one in the world in both singles and doubles. He has played in the Davis Cup and the Hopman Cup for his country. His Wimbledon victory two years ago has been called one of the bravest in the modern time. Had he not been injured,he would undoubtedly have won a third Wimbledon Championship. Billy is regarded by many as perhaps the finest player ever in international tennis. 
But of course Billy is much more than a tennis champion. 
He is like an ambassador for the sport and for his country. He has done great work to help children around the world,and his generosity to children's charity funds is well known. 
And of course,Billy is the most successful graduate of our club. He won the club championships when he was twelve--yes,at only twelve. And Billy has not forgotten where it all started. That's why he accepted our invitation to speak to us tonight. We're proud to have played a small part in Billy's success. 
Won't you please give a big hand to our own Billy Rogers? 
 Question:How many kinds of famous tournaments did Billy Rogers takes part in according to the text? 
A. Two. 
B. Four. 
C. Three. 
D. Six. 
 Answer: B
Context: An invisible smile
Mr. Dawson was an old grouch  , and everyone in town knew it. Kids knew not to go into his yard to pick a delicious apple, even off the ground, because old Dawson, they said, would come after you with his ball bullet gun.
One Friday, 12-year-old Janet was going to stay all night with her friend Amy. They had to walk by Dawson's house on the way to Amy's house, but as they got close Janet saw him sitting on his front porch and suggested they cross over to the other side of the street. Like most of the children, she was scared of the old man because of the stories she'd heard about him.
Amy said not to worry, Mr. Dawson wouldn't hurt anyone. When they got close enough, Dawson looked up with his usual frown, but when he saw it was Amy, a broad smile changed his entire face as he said, ""Hello Miss Amy. I see you've got a little friend with you today.""
Amy smiled back and told him Janet was staying overnight and they were going to listen to music and play games. Dawson told them that sounded fun, and offered them each a fresh picked apple off his tree. 
When they got out of Dawson on earshot, Janet asked Amy, ""Everyone says he's the meanest man in town. How come was he so nice to us?""
Amy explained that when she first started walking past his house he wasn't very friendly and she was afraid of him, but she pretended he was wearing an invisible smile and so she always smiled back at him. It took a while, but one day he half-smiled back at her.
After some more time, he started smiling real smiles and then started talking to her. 
""An invisible smile?"" questioned Janet.
""Yes,"" answered Amy, ""my grandma told me that if I pretended I wasn't afraid and pretended he was smiling an invisible smile at me and I smiled back at him, that sooner or later he would really smile. Grandma says smiles are contagious.""
However, it's so easy to get caught up in everyday life that we forget how simple it can be to bring cheer to ourselves and others. If we remember what Amy's grandma said, that everyone wears an invisible smile, we too will find that most people can't resist our smile after a while.

A. invite them to his yard for fun

Context: When I stepped out the plane from Miami into Charlotte, North Carolina, airport for a connecting flight home, I immediately knew something was wrong. Lots of desperate people crowded the terminal. I quickly learned that flights headed to the Northeast were called off because of a storm. The earliest they could get us out of Charlotte was Tuesday. It was Friday. A gate agent stood on the counter and shouted, ""Don't ask us for help! We cannot help you!""
I joined a crowd that ran from terminal to terminal in search of a flight out. Eventually, I found six strangers willing to rent a van with me. We drove through the night to Washington, where I took a train the rest of the way to Providence.
The real problem, of course, is that incidents like this happen every day, to everyone who flies, more and more often. It really gets to me, though, because for eight years I was on the other side, as a flight attendant for Trans-World Airlines (TWA).
I know the days are gone when attendants could be written up if we did not put the lines napkins with the TWA logo in the lower right-hand corner of the first-class diners' trays. As are the days when there were three dinner options on flights from Boston to Los Angeles in economy class. When, once, stuck on a tarmac in Newark for four hours, a planeload of passengers got McDonald's hamburgers and fries by thoughtfulness of the airline. I have experienced the decline of service along with the rest of the flying public. But I believe everything will change little by little, because I remember the days when to fly was to soar  . The airlines, and their employees, took pride in how their passengers were treated. And I think the days are sure to come back one day in the near future. 
 Question:What can be implied from the passage?  _ 
A. The writer lived in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
B. The writer thought the service was not as good as it used to be. 
C. The writer with other passengers waited to be picked up patiently. 
D. Passengers would feel proud of how they were treated on the plane.

Context: It was evening rush hour on Pacific Coast Highway in Redondo Beach, CA. Drivers lined up from traffic signal to traffic signal and were anxious to get home. On a side street merging   into this highway was a timid driver who was afraid to edge in and no one let her in. Some of the drivers backed up behind her and loudly blasted their horns. This made her more upset and nervous. 
On the right of this side street, the signal on Pacific Coast Highway turned red and traffic stopped. A driver who saw what was happening to this woman stopped a few car lengths behind her car and motioned to her to pull in front of his car. She quickly did and as he waited, two more cars dashed in behind her car. 
While the woman he'd helped waited for the signal to turn green, she sank into her driver's seat and was deeply relieved. Although this thoughtful man couldn't see it, her body language expressed her gratitude.
If you've been in a traffic situation like the one she was in, you know how upsetting it can be. But this little act of kindness allowed her to safely reach her home. She told others about this, which encouraged them to do something nice for someone else. 
This kindness spreads. Someone does something nice for you and in turn you're likely to do something nice for that person or for someone else. 
A simple act of kindness could have a widespread effect. It's like a stone that drops in a pond and causes ripples in each direction. No one knows how far those ripples will travel but they will affect everything they touch along the way. 
 Question:What can we know about most of the drivers on Pacific Coast Highway from the story? 
A. They were not friendly or thoughtful. 
B. They are thankful to the driver who helped the lady. 
C. They blasted their horns to encourage the lady driver. 
D. They were not anxious to get home. 
 Answer: A
Context: How much empathy do you feel towards other people? If you saw someone fall off their bike in traffic,would you stop and help--or just walk away? Many people would give in to coldness,go about their business and just do nothing.So it was a big surprise when about  100 bystanders got together recently to move a bus in east London to help a cyclist trapped under it.A video of the incident went viral on social media.
According to Zoheb,a driver who stopped his car to take part in the rescue,about five  people gathered to move the bus.He says:""There was no chance we could do it,it was more  an invitation for other people to help,really.""
The initiative paid off.Diners from nearby restaurants joined in.There wasn't much coordination but it didn't take long to develop a collective understanding of what the  objective was.
Spontaneous cooperation among strangers doesn't happen often.People in a  crowd are not sure what to do--they don't have a plan.It's one of the reasons bystanders often do nothing,according to Dr Mark Levine,professor of social psychology at Exeter University in Britain.""The presence of others can prevent you from helping"",he says.
The key to positive group behaviour,Levine explains,""is building a sense of shared identity"".Action has to be decided quickly,Levine says.""The longer you leave it,the harder it is to make a decision.If you don't immediately act then you kind of think'Well,actually I probably couldn't have done anything anyway'.""
But the people who took the initiative like Zoheb might make a difference.The cyclist ended up in hospital and the images of the collective effort might inspire others to more acts of unity. 
 Question:Why do people give in to coldness when they should be helping according to Levine? 
A. They don't know how to give first aid. 
B. Nobody wants to be the first to offer help. 
C. Strangers seldom cooperate with each other. 
D. They are forbidden from helping.

Context: One of the problems career people  have in the morning is dressing for the office when there will be an evening party immediately followed, with no time to return home to change. The easiest solution is to keep a full set of toiletries   and make-ups stored somewhere at the office. A woman going to an evening party should dress in one of her ""basic dresses"" in the morning--the kind that can change into a different look with an added scarf or jewelry. In fifteen minutes, when her office day has ended, she can metamorphose  herself into another person with freshly cleaned teeth, combed hair, a new face, a different and dressier  pair of shoes, and some sparkling jewelry. If she must wear a long dress for the party, she should bring it to the office in a protective bag and store it safely until she has to put it on.

Context: A new product - the Apple Watch - into the market. Last year, the watch was firstly introduced by Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. The price of the watch is from $349 to $1,099, depending on its size and whether it is a sports or regular one.
Apple engineers and designers have put in a lot of thought and hard work into creating this ""small screen"" on your wrist .  The ""sensor "" on the screen not only finds your finger, but also knows the difference between when you are tapping , and when you are pressing hard er.
The watch also has ""haptic feedback "". You can s end personal messages to your friend --such as drawing a star or a special sign with your fingers, or tapping the watch, say 3 times, and your friend will receive those taps on their wrist.
Besides telling the time, the watch will use 'Bluetooth' to connect with your iPhone and show calls or text messages that come in.
According to Tim Cook, the watch may open up a whole new area of applications  that we had never thought of. Some car f actories like BMW have developed an app that allows its car owners to open their cars with the watch. A 'Hotels' app may allow you to open the door to your hotel room without worrying about losing the smart-card. And finally, even at the airport--passengers may be able to simply wave their wrist to check into their flight.
The biggest use of the watch, however, is as your personal fitness coach. The watch can show your pulse (heartbeat) using a sensor at the bottom of the watch. It also has the same sensor as your iPhone, so it knows when you are moving, and also how much you are walking or running. It will remind you if you have been sitting for too long without taking exercise. 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that the Apple Watch  _  . 
A. is designed by Tim Cook 
B. was brought into the market last week 
C. sells at different prices for different colors 
D. can show your pulse and knows when you are moving. 
 Answer: D
Context: (CNN) -- In the last week, the Apple iWatch has made the jump from unlikely rumor to a real product that's probably in development, thanks to reports showing up in various publications.
The clues are planting the seeds of an Apple watch in consumers' minds. The general public has not been crying out for a better watch. And Apple prides itself on knowing what the people want before they do, and an Apple watch would be much more than just a fancy timepiece.
It's not about the watch form factor, but creating a wearable mobile device that takes advantage of advances in mobile computing technology such as cheap sensors, better battery life and improved voice recognition.
If executed correctly, an Apple watch could bring about a profitable industry of products to go with it, like it did with the iOS App Store and mobile applications.
""It's unlimited, the number of wearable things you can put into,"" said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, who imagines small companies making inexpensive products like belts with sensors that send warnings to the watch when you've eaten too much.
Apple is not entering virgin territory. There are already a handful of fancy smart watches available, but most act as accessories , connecting to the more powerful Android and iOS smartphones and tablets over Bluetooth.
For example, the new Pebble smart watch passes on alerts from a smartphone, so when you receive a text, e-mail, or Facebook notification it is pushed to the watch, which vibrates .
Wearable technology is also booming, thanks to cheap sensors that can be used to track things like movement and heart rates. The number of wearable fitness products has been growing at a fast pace, but an Apple offering would shake up the industry completely.
""We're finally getting some players involved, and Apple is the real one that can add some value to some of this wearable technology,"" said Munster.
Apple isn't alone in seeing the potential for this type of technology. Google is working on its own wearable platform, Google Glasses. The two will compete against each other when they are finally available, each sporting its own unique opinion on what kind of user interface people will use (voice control and a small touchscreen or augmented reality). And they will, of course, have their own ecosystems of accessories and apps.
Traditional watches have dropped in popularity in recent years. Smartphones display the easy-to-see time and are already in our back pockets, so it can seem unnecessary to also tie a small clock to our wrists. But when you start packing more power, sensors and connection options like Bluetooth into a watch, it no longer stays to be a watch and becomes a small wearable computer.
An Apple watch could suddenly become better than the current crop of smart watches by creating a platform, not another accessory. According to Munster, the three tasks people use their smartphones for are, in order, texting, Internet and phone calls. Two out of three of those tasks would be a natural fit for a small device, while the need to surf and play games would ensure the smartphone doesn't become out of date. 
 Question:It's most likely that after the iWatch comes onto the market,   _  . 
A. a great many tablet computers will be off the shelf 
B. many relevant businesses will burst on the scene 
C. belts with sensors will made inexpensive 
D. a traditional wristwatch will be unnecessary

Context: COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A group of black parents and civil rights activists presented a petition  Thursday calling for officials to drop charges against a 16-year-old South Carolina high school student who was videotaped being dragged from her desk and thrown to the floor by a police officer in her classroom.
The group said it was unfair and unacceptable that the student and her 18-year-old classmate at Spring Valley High School who taped the incident were the only people charged that day when authorities already knew Richland County Deputy Ben Fields had tossed the girl from her desk to the ground.
They also said their petition had hundreds of thousands of names from around the country asking prosecutor Dan Johnson to drop the ""disturbing schools"" charges against the teens. The students in the case are black; Fields is white.
Johnson issued a statement Wednesday saying he won't do anything with the case until the FBI finishes its investigation into Fields, who was fired after the video became public. ""I do not simply decide cases based upon feelings, public opinion or sentiment, nor do I decide them based on political pressure,"" Johnson said in the statement.
Disturbing schools is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or 90 days in jail. The students' lawyer did not respond to telephone messages.
The video spread quickly across the country, prompting questions about when police officers should get involved with classroom discipline. Fields was called to the classroom after the student refused to stop using her cellphone, and then she would not leave the classroom for a teacher or administrator.
In the days after the incident, the teacher turned her class over to a substitute and the administrator was placed on leave. Richland two officials didn't respond to an email asking about their current status. The students were allowed back in school.
Organizers of the protest said they plan to be at South Carolina's Statehouse next year, calling for legislators to change the law that allows police officers to arrest students for misbehaving at schools. Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott blamed that law for escalating the situation. ""Let's find a way where we don't saddle students with arrest records,"" said EfiaNwangaza from the Malcom X Center for Self Determination. ""Let's get ahead of the schoolhouse-to-jailhouse train in South Carolina."" 
 Question:What is Don Johnson's attitude towards the case? 
A. Indifferent 
B. Ambiguous 
C. Subjective 
D. Cautious 
 Answer: D
Context: Bobbi Kristina Brown's family has been gathered around her since she was hospitalized on Saturday after being found unconscious in the bathtub of her suburban Atlanta townhome.
Whitney Houston's only child is now at Emory University Hospital and is still fighting for her life, as a family statement said on Monday.
Nothing has changed, despite reports that are popping up and painting a more serious picture.
Fox News reported Wednesday that the situation is horrific. ""It's now a matter of when the family wants to let go and accept that she's pretty much not going to make it,"" a source told FOX411. ""They've left it up to the family as to how long they want to keep her alive.""
People Magazine is also reporting that a doctor told Brown's family on Wednesday that nothing more could be done. ""Everyone is coming to the hospital to say goodbye,"" said a family member.
And the Daily Mail says Brown has been taken off life support.
But Bobby Brown issued a statement late Thursday denying these reports.
""If we issued a statement every time the media published a false report regarding this matter, that's all we would be doing 24 hours a day. This is false, just as is the vast majority of the other reporting that is currently taking place,"" he said, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.
A source close to the family tells USA TODAY that it's wrong to say the family is gathering to say goodbye, because the family has been there since the beginning, so nothing is any different today for them.
Also, Brown is ""not brain dead,"" as has been reported.
And, as for other stories saying that the Houston family is feuding with Bobbi Kristina's dad, Bobby Brown? Those aren't true either. They ""are NOT fighting,"" says our source. 
 Question:Which can be the best title of the passage? 
A. An Accident In The Bathtub

C. False Reports From Different News Media

Context: Americans think a great deal about time. From childhood they learn to value time. As children, they are taught to be on time to go to school, to do work and to do everything. When they are having a good time, they say that time flies. When a person is dying, they say he is living on borrowed time. Time is money. Time is knowledge. Time is everything in America. A working America has to work hard for 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week. This is the working time. In his free time, he also works hard for more money. Even Saturday and Sunday are filled with activities. In the street you can hardly see a man who walks slowly. They walk very fast. In fact, they are running. They love time because time brings them money, comforts and progress. But sometimes they also hate time, for they feel they have become servants of the clock.

Context: My students often tell me that they don't have ""enough time"" to do all their schoolwork.
My reply is often a brief ""You have as much time as the president.""I usually carry on a bit about there being twenty-four hours in the day for everyone, and suggest that ""not enough time"" is not an acceptable explanation of not getting something done.
Once in graduate school,I tried to prove to one of my professors by saying that I was working hard.His answer to me was. ""That's irrelevant .What's important is the quality of your work. "" Since then I have had time to think carefully about the ""hard worker"" dodge ,and I have come to some conclusions--all relevant to the problem of how much time we have.
If you analyze the matter, you can identify two parts of the prob1em:There is, of course,the matter of ""time"", which we call think of as fixed. Then there is the problem of ""work"" during that time. But, as my professor suggested, it's not how hard one works but the quality of the product that's important.
That led me to a new idea: the quality of the work.That concept is perhaps best explained by a sign I once saw on the wall in someone s office: ""Don't work harder. Work smarter."" There is a lot of sense in that idea.
If you can't get more time,and few of US can,the only solution is to improve the quality of the work.That means thinking of ways to get more out of the same time than we might otherwise get.That should lead us to an analysis of our work habits.Since ""work"" for students usually means ""homework"", the expression ""work habits' should be read as ""study habits"".
Then, as a smart student,you will seek to improve those skills that you use in study, chiefly reading and writing. If you learn to read better and write better,there are big advantages that pay off in all your studies. 
 Question:What's the passage mainly about? 
A. Students don't have enough time. 
B. Don't work harder; work smarter. 
C. No one can get more time. 
D. Read better and write better.

Context: The events of Saturday night in Kunming are deeply engraved in the mind of Xie Qiming, who narrowly escaped death in the terrorist attack at the city's railway station.
The 48-year-old policeman intervened to stop the butchering of unarmed civilians, saving many from death and injury, but he was injured in the process.
Lying in a hospital bed, his head and nose marked by serious hacking wounds - one more than 20 centimeters long - Xie recounted  his actions on the day he describes as a nightmare.
""I shot at them but fell to the ground during the fighting. After the shots, the terrorists turned their attention to the police and several of them surrounded me and stabbed me like crazy,"" he said. ""There is no humanity in them.""
Xie is from the Beijinglu Police Station, the closest to the attack, and four police officers from the station were the first to respond. He survived because he was wearing a bulletproof vest, which was damaged by the attackers.
When the officers arrived, the attackers were running out of the ticket hall, attacking people with long knives.
Xie and his colleagues tried to stop the attack, which is when Xie was injured. In addition to the deep cuts, his skull was fractured, and at the time of writing he was awaiting further surgery.
""A wave of fierce anger rose up in my mind, and we all forgot to think about the possible danger to us,"" said Hu Zhe, 23, a police officer trainee at the Beijinglu Police Station.
Having no firearm, he fought the terrorists with a wooden baton, but it got broken in the fighting. He sustained a 6-centimeter wound to his left eyebrow.
Wan Weiqing, a neurosurgeon from Beijing Tiantan Hospital, learned of the attack at 2 am on Sunday and took the first flight to Kunming, where he has been helping the victims.
He said that 71 victims are being treated at the Kunming First People's Hospital, most of them with severe multiple injuries.
""There is one victim whose rib, breastbone, lung and even heart were all injured in one chopping action. The attackers had obviously prepared and practiced for a long time,"" he said.
Zhou Hongmei, director of the Medical Reform Office at the Yunnan Health Department, said a team of medical experts including 29 doctors had arrived in Kunming by Monday night. They have been working at the five hospitals treating victims of the attack.
Chen Min, a Neurology Department nurse at Kunming First People's Hospital, said the department usually had seven nurses in the daytime and three at night. ""But all the other nurses who were not on duty returned to the hospital voluntarily on Saturday night,"" she said.
In the past three days, none of them had more than 10 hours of rest.
""The crucial factor in saving lives in such incidents is treatment without delay,"" said Chai Wenzhao, associate director of the Intensive Care Unit in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Chai has participated in many emergency rescue efforts.
He said that the victims will need psychological counseling once their physical injuries have been dealt with, because the emotional impact of such an incident can be severe.
Four psychologists from Anding Hospital in Beijing have begun treating some of the victims. 
 Question:How did Xie Qiming survive? 
A. He was saved by his colleagues. 
B. He missed the shot and fell to the ground during the fighting. 
C. He was protected by his bulletproof vest. 
D. He pretended to fall to the ground.

Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""
It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on. 
 Question:That man called after reading about what Jordan did to a disabled child because he wanted to   _  . 
A. become famous himself 
B. know why Jordan appeared in a poor area 
C. let the author know that Jordan was not that nice 
D. offer another example to show that Jordan was a nice man

Context: I'm telling Mother about a new girl in school,and she suddenly looks up and says,""Who're your two best friends?"" I'm not sure what to say.I've been friends with Jill since I was three or so,and I really like Jaime,a friend in kindergarten.""Well,what about Karen and Cindy?"" She seems upset,like I hurt her feelings.""But they're my sisters."" ""Yes,but they can still be your best friends.Friends may come and go,but your sisters will always be there for you.""
At the time,the idea of my two sisters being my closest friends seemed strange to me.We fought all the time over toys,food and attention.How could my sisters be my best friends?They weren't the same age as I.We all had our own friends in school.But my mother never let the three of us forget it:Sisters are lifelong friends.Her wish was to give us something that she never had.Growing up an only child,she longed for siblings  .When she gave birth to three daughters,the fulfillment of her dream had only just begun.She'd given us each a gift and she wanted to make sure we did not take that gift for granted.She'd frequently tell us how lucky we were.She never showed favoritism to one daughter over the other.And when we were teenagers,Mom always punished us equally.
We didn't always get along beautifully and fought just like any other siblings.But we realized that our mother was right.Today I share things with my sisters that I do with no one else.My sister Cindy and I ran the New York City Marathon together,sidebyside,even holding hands when we crossed the finish line.When my sister Karen got married,I was her maid of honor.The three of us trust each other with our greatest secrets.
It was twentythree years ago that my mother first asked me who my two best friends were.Today she doesn't have to.She already knows.

A. My mother and father. 
B. Jill and Jaime.

Context: Recently, we were given the opportunity to review a book written by a young author. When we received it, I noted how beautifully done it was. While often the case---we see beautifully written and illustrated books all the time---but how often do they come from a 10-year-old? Sewing a Friendship, written by a creative and talented young girl named Natalie Tinti, is such a book.
Developing friendships is an area that Natalie Tinti has researched in her own life. In her book, Sewing a Friendship, she tells what great things can happen if kids take a step toward friendship.
Tinti's characters in Sewing a Friendship have colorful and creative personalities. Jonsy Jipsy loves singing and belly dance. Sokron Blossom lives in a neat and tidy world and loves to read fashion magazines. Meeka likes brain games and Nina is happy with her life and the music it brings her.
All but one of the characters seems happy with their lives. One of the girls, Kiki Shaver, was sad to live in a small home with her aunt and uncle. She had no friend and didn't know how to make them. When four girls invites her into the circle of their friendship, it's no wonder that Kiki is hesitant and uneasy.
The story continues as the four girls invite and accept a "" not so likeable"" girl into their circle to win a fashion show. The girls feel a strong bond of friendship after the show. Kiki then understands that taking a step towards friendship is better than being alone. All the girls learn that by having the courage to include others, you can "" sew a friendship"".
Today, it seems that almost every news headline begins with a child's suicide---or murder---because of being bullied ,not having friends or family to discuss issues with and feelings of low self -respect. What's causing these senseless terrible events? If more kids would invite the outcasts  into their circle of friends, lives would be saved as well as pointed in another direction.
Natalie Tinti finds her voice in Sewing a Friendship ---and shows a talent that's rare for such a young girl. Recommended reading for all young adult fans. 
 Question:The author seems to agree that   _  . 
A. bullying is the main cause of children's suicides 
B. we should not expect too much from friendship 
C. friendship has the power to prevent sad events 
D. one should not forget his old circle of friends

Context: There are two types of people in the world. Although they have equal degree of health and wealth and other forts of life, one bees happy and the other bees unhappy. This arises from the different ways in which they consider things, persons, events and the resulting effects upon their minds.
People who are to be happy fix their attention on the convenience of things: the pleasant parts of conversation, the well prepared dishes, the goodness of the wine and the fine weather. They enjoy all the cheerful things. Those who are to be unhappy think and speak only of the opposite things. Therefore, they are continually dissatisfied. By their remarks, they sour the pleasure of society, offend (hurt) many people, and make themselves disagreeable everywhere. If this turn of mind was founded in nature, such unhappy persons would be the more to be pitied. The intention of criticizing  and being disliked is perhaps taken up by imitation . It grows into a habit, unknown to its possessors. The habit may be strong, but it may be cured when those who have it realize its bad effects on their interests and tastes. I hope this little warning may be of service to them, and help them change this habit. 
Although in fact it is chiefly an act of the imagination, it has serious results in life since it brings on deep sorrow and bad luck. Those people offend many others; nobody loves them, and no one treats them with more than the most mon politeness and respect. This frequently puts them in bad temper and draws them into arguments. If they aim at getting some advantages in social position or fortune, nobody wishes them success. Nor will anyone start a step or speak a word to favor their hopes. If they bring on themselves public objections, no one will defend or excuse them, and many will join to criticize their wrongdoings. These should change this bad habit and be pleased with what is pleasing, without worrying needlessly about themselves and others. If they do not, it will be good for others to avoid any contact  with them. Otherwise, it can be disagreeable and sometimes very inconvenient, especially when one bees mixed up in their quarrels. 
 Question:The phrase ""sour the pleasure of society"" most nearly means ""  _  "". 
A. have a good taste with social life 
B. make others unhappy 
C. tend to please others openly 
D. enjoy the pleasure of life 
 Answer: B
Context: Recordings of angry bees are enough to send big, tough African elephants running away, a new study says. Beehives  -either recorded or real-may even prevent elephants from damaging farmer's crops.
In 2002, scientist Lucy King and her team found that elephants avoid certain trees with bees living in them. Today,  Lucy wants to see if African honeybees might discourage elephants from eating crops. But before she asked farmer to go to the trouble of setting up beehives on their farms, she needed to find out if the bees would scare elephants away.
Lucy found a wild beehive inside a tree in northern Kenya and set up a recorder. Then she threw a stone into the beehive, which burst into life. Lucy and her assistant hid in their car until the angry bees had calmed down. Next,Lucy searched out elephant families in Samburu National Reserve in northern Kenya and put a speaker in a close to each family.
From a distance, Lucy switched on the pre-recorded sound of angry bees while at the same time recording the elephants with a video camera. Half the elephant groups left the area within ten seconds. Out of a total of 17 groups, only one group ignored the sound of the angry bees. Lucy reported that all the young elephants immediately ran to their mothers to hide under them. When Lucy Played the sound of a waterfall   instead of the angry bees to many of the same elephant families, the animals were undisturbed. Even after four minutes, most of the groups stayed in one place.
Lucy is now studying whether the elephants will continue to avoid the sound of angry bees after hearing it several times. She hasn't tested enough groups yet to know, but her initial   results were promising enough to begin trials with farmers. She has now begun placing speakers in the fields to see if elephants are frightened away. 
 Question:Why did Lucy throw a stone into a wild beehive? 
A. To record the sound of bees. 
B. To make a video of elephants. 
C. To see if elephants would run away. 
D. To find out more about the behavior of bees.

Context: Perfectionists believe that not only is perfection achievable, but that it should be achieved whenever possible. They always try to make their work better, and often get pleasure from investing time and effort in their projects. They enjoy paying attention to detail and are often hard to please. After all, perfectionists almost always have nearlyimpossible standards for themselves, much higher than what outside parties would generally hope for.
Most perfectionists are also highlyorganized. They've perfected their work process along with everything else in their life. They have processes and patterns for handling almost anything that comes their way, from email to new projects and clients to bookkeeping. It can definitely add up to a more effective workday with less wasted time and effort.
Perfectionists can be thought of as overbearing  by those who don't share their attitude. It can also be upsetting to clients who aren't interested in ""perfect"" and simply want their project done yesterday. When you strive for perfection, everything takes just a bit longer to get right. Even if you have a more efficient design and development process than many other designers, it is likely that you spend more time on each step than a lot of others do.
While most people who call themselves ""perfectionists"" do so in a lighthearted or positive manner, there are those out there to whom perfection becomes an obsession . They consider anything less than perfect completely unacceptable. This can lead to obsessive behavior and can have damaging effects on their overall quality of life. Just feeling good about a job done to the best of your ability is entirely normal for a perfectionists and isn't something to worry about. But it becomes particularly dangerous when perfectionists feel they are never quite able to attain perfection, and so drive themselves crazy trying to always reach this unattainable goal.
These perfectionists often place their entire selfworth on their accomplishments and ability to reach perfection, and since they're never able to reach it, it creates a very negative selfimage and low selfesteem or depression. The good news is that there are trained psychologists who can help those who are nervously obsessed with perfection to overcome their obsession. 
 Question:Clients who are not satisfied with perfectionists think they need   _  . 
A. better coworkers 
B. bigger achievements 
C. higher efficiency 
D. less organization skills 
 Answer: C

One Saturday Christine gave me a painting lesson because I was always attempting to be artistic too.But I knocked over the vase of flowers,spilling water onto Christine's painting.Instead of becoming angry,though,she turned the whole mess into a dreamy masterpiece .You could look at it five different ways and see five different things.With this brilliant creation,she won First Prize in the art competition.I really envied her,but I knew it wasn't her fault and I was the one with wild,unmanageable hair and no talent.
Joining Christine's basketball team was my latest effort to be like her.
On the way to the gym,I'd made up my mind to give my best performance in that day's game.I made preparations with great enthusiasm.""Christine,here!""I tossed her a ball.But it was too high,she leapt for it,it slipped through her fingers and crashed into the tape recorder that was used to play the national anthem before each game.
 I muttered apologies as I picked up the broken pieces of the recorder.Coach looked at the mess and asked,""How are we going to play the song now?""
Christine suggested,""Let Katie sing it!She's always singing at home.""
 Coach asked.""Would you?""I found myself nodding.
     Coach announced the national anthem and everyone stood.Standing before a microphone,I looked up to the flag.The notes seemed to flow from deep inside me,and my voice was steady and clear.When I finished,the gym was silent Then it was filled with applause.As the game started.teammates patted my back and gave me the""thumbs up""sign.Laura Jamison said.""You should try out for the school musical!""I Nodded and said that I might.
 The next morning Hillary Barnes stopped me in the hallway and asked,""Are you the twin who sings?""
""Yes,that's me,""I answered,grining as I walked to class. 
 Question:Christine recommended Katie for the national anthem because   _  .

Context: Soaping up your hands may do more than just get rid of germs. It may wash away the inner confusion you feel right after being forced to make a choice between two appealing choices, according to a new study. The study builds on the past research into a phenomenon known as ""the Macbeth effect""  .
It turns out that Shakespeare was really onto something when he imagined Lady Macbeth trying to clean her conscience by rubbing invisible bloodstains from her hands.
A few years ago, scientists asked people to describe a past wrong act. If people were then given a chance to clean their hands, they later expressed less guilt than people who hadn't cleaned.
This finding interested W. S. Lee, a researcher. ""Anything from the past, any kind of negative emotional experiences, might be washed away,"" says Lee.
He decided to test hand washing's effect on one kind of bad feeling:the tension we feel after being forced to choose between two attractive choices, because picking one choice makes us feel that we've lost the other. People usually try to calm this inner conflict by later exaggerating  the positive aspects of their choice.
He had students rank 10 different music CDs. Then he offered students two of the CDs and told them to select one as a gift. Some students then used liquid soap. Others only looked at the soap or sniffed  it. ""Actually, you do not need water and soap,"" says Lee.
Later, the students again had to rank all the music CDs. People who didn't wash their hands had the normal response -- they scored their take-home CD higher, suggesting that they now saw it as an even more attractive one than before. But this wasn't true for the hand washers. They ranked the music about the same. ""They feel no need at all to justify (...)the choice,"" says Lee.
But the effects of it just aren't clear. Schwarz says it's too soon to know whether people should head for a sink after making a tough choice. He says washing may help decision-makers by cleaning away mental disorder. But perhaps if they don't go through the usual post-decision process of justifying their choice, they might feel more sorrow in the long run. 
 Question:According to Lee, those hand washers consider justifying their choice   _  . 
A. scientific 
B. useful 
C. unnecessary 
D. convincing

The poor old man didn't have anything to cover himself with. Sam went into his house to get the old man a blanket.

Context: There are a lot of things that happen to me in China but would certainly never happen in the US. One of those things is being called ""strong"".
The first time was last December. I was walking across the high school campus in Guangzhou where I taught when a student in a gray scarf waved hello. I smiled and waved back, but then she stopped and called my name. ""You're so strong!"" She smiled and pointed at what appeared to be my arm.
I looked down at my arms. Let's get one thing clear: I'm a very skinny guy. Once, while rehearsing for a high school talent show, I was told by the teacher in charge that I couldn't participate in the men's shirtless dance routine because my visible rig cage  would frighten the audience.
""I'm so what?"" ""You're so strong!"" _ repeated. ""Um, thanks!"" I didn't know what else to say, so we both waved goodbye.
The next morning I stepped into my oral English classroom only to be greeted instantly by a unanimous  ""Waaa!"" of shock and admiration. ""What?"" I asked. ""You're so strong!"" shouted a boy from the back of the class.
""Okay, will someone tell me what that means?"" I was curious as to the real reason for such praise. So I turned to the monitor, gesturing for him to speak.
""We just mean, you look very strong today,"" he offered earnestly.
""What?! You mean like this?"" I curled my arm like a bodybuilder.
""No! But it's so cold, and you're only wearing a shortsleeve shirt.""
Oh, I got it. My ""strength"" had less to do with my muscle and more to do with my apparent ignorance of the cold weather.

Context: People often use gestures to express our feelings, but the problem is that the gestures can be understood in different ways.
It is true that a smile means the same thing in any language.  So does laughter or crying.  Fear is another emotion  that is shown in much the same way all over the world.  In Chinese and in English literature, a phrase like ""he went pale and began to tremble"" suggests that the man is either very afraid or he has just got a very big shock.
However, ""he opened his eyes wide"" is used to suggest anger in Chinese whereas in English it means surprise. In Chinese, surprise can be described in a phrase like ""they stretched out their tongues!"" ""Stretching out your tongue"" in English is an insulting(, )gesture or expresses strong dislike.
Even in the same culture, people differ in their ability to understand and express feelings.  Experiments in America have shown that women are usually better than men at recognizing fear,  anger,  love and happiness on people's faces. Other studies show that older people usually find it easier to understand body language than younger people do. 
 Question:The best title for this passage can be   _   . 
A. Gestures 
B. Feelings

D. Gestures and Feelings

Context: You probably remember me from the other day. I was the one who reacted very slowly to the green traffic light. When you honked your horn ,I realized I was holding up traffic, so please accept my apology. However, I do want you to know why I seemed in a confused state. You see, I was just at the doctor's office getting the results of the examination I had two weeks ago, and I was wondering how I would tell my husband and children that I had cancer. There were still tears in my eyes, so,quite simply I didn't even see the lights change. Perhaps I should not have been driving, but I didn't want to miss my appointment.
I was in the express lane at the supermarket without thinking and moving. Please accept my apology. My mind was on my youngest daughter who ran away from home, and she?'just sixteen. I was so worried then. You see, she somehow got in with the wrong crowd and started using drugs and drinking. I was remembering what a pretty little girl she had been most of her life. I know you were unhappy along with others in line. Please, accept my apology.
I remember you from the store last week. I was so mean to you, when you were doing your job to the best of your ability. I acted so childishly. Please accept my apology. You see, I arrived home from work just yesterday and discovered that my wife had left me, but I should never have taken it out on you. Please, accept my apology.
The above are imagined incidents, and yet they expressed a very real truth. The old saying about judging others before you ""have walked a mile in their shoes"" is a much needed reminder. Perhaps we all could try to learn the fact that there are problems and situation in the lives of others which we are totally unaware of. So, maybe before we get angry in similar situations, we should think a moment and understand that things may be going on in other's lives which have caused them to be slower, absent-minded or angry. Patience, as they say, is a virtue. 
 Question:What does the author mainly want to express? 
A. Learn to accept others?apology. 
B. We need more patience and understanding. 
C. Be patient when you are in line. 
D. The patient should not drive to the office. 
 Answer: B
Context: After I made it to the city center, I started to feel it might be easy for a foreigner to deal with the great size of Beijing. With growing confidence, I decided to take the subway to the hotel, not realizing that the network didn't go that far. Impressed with the cleanliness of the station, I bought a ticket and boarded the first train that came along.
After a few minutes I asked in English of course a young man seated next to me where I should get off closest to the Friendship Hotel. Wearing a smart business suit and tie, he would surely speak English, wouldn't he? Unfortunately, he couldn't understand me but seemed very friendly. I showed him the room card with all the information of the Friendship Hotel in Chinese characters. He looked at it, and then his eyes moved quickly to the carriage   subway map. Next, he raised three fingers of his right hand.
In Australia, raising fingers at someone is not usually nice, but this man wasn't smiling. At the next station he showed me two fingers. Now in   Australia, that's really rude, but I got the message. When we stopped at the third station, he didn't just point to the door, but got up, took me out of the train, and led me to the top of the stairs, and out onto the street. Then he stopped a taxi and told the driver where to take me.
All this came from a man who couldn't speak my language, and I couldn't speak his. I was now speechless, especially when he refused my offer of money. I felt a little embarrassed having even thought he would accept a tip.
This experience made it clear I had to learn some Chinese quickly or my adventures might start turning into bad luck. 
 Question:The author's purpose of writing this passage is mainly to   _  . 
A. prove the importance of being careful 
B. appreciate the kindness of the young man

Context: I was 18 when Tim and I began to date. Shy and quiet, I'd met his parents once before but hadn't ventured to say more than "" Hello"". This particular evening, however, we were taking them out to dinner for their anniversary and I wanted to make a good impression.
Tim and his parents arrived and I was out the door in a flash. My good impression began with "" punctual"". I sat in the backseat beside Tim nervously watching his father's eyes glance into the rearview mirror to examine me.
Tim and his parents had already decided on their favorite Mexican restaurant and that was fine with me; the dim lighting would hide the rising flush of my cheeks, and if anyone noticed, I could blame it on the peppers. With proper table manners I managed to survive halfway through dinner without making any unforgivable mistakes. However, in the midst of conversation I reached for my iced tea, raised the glass to my lips and very quickly discovered I had picked up the wrong glass.
I quickly lowered the glass and set it back but it was too late; I had burnt my eyebrows, the hair in my nose, and curl over my forehead! I looked up slowly, praying no one had seen me, but all eyes at the table had seen and each face stared at me in shocked silence. Excusing myself, I ran to the restroom.
I would have hidden there forever but I'd barely gotten in the door when Tim's mother arrived. "" Ah, honey,"" she said, holding out her arms to me. "" Everything will be just fine.""
Tim and I eventually married. We had a small ceremony and a family reception afterwards held at the very restaurant where this incident occurred. This time, however, I didn't drink any candles... only a Margarita ; they were served in different glasses. 
 Question:It can be inferred from the passage that  _  . 
A. the author had never met her parents-in-law before dinning together 
B. Tim and the author took the bus to get to the restaurant 
C. Tim's father was curious to know about the author

Context: I'm not so sure I like my friends any more. I used to like them-to be honest. We'd have lunch, talk on the phone or exchange emails, and they all seemed normal enough. But then came Face Book, and I was introduced to a sad fact: many of my friends have dark sides that they had kept from me.
Today my friends show off the more unpleasant aspects of their personalities via FaceBook. No longer hidden, they're thrown in my face like TV commercials -unavoidable and endless advertisements for the worst of their personalities.
Take Fred. If you were to have lunch with him, you'd find him warm, and self-effacing .Read his FaceBook and you'll realize he's an unbearable, food-obsessed boring man. He'd pause to have a cup of coffee on his way to save a drowning man-and then write about it.
Take Andy. You won't find a smarter CEO anywhere, but now he's a CEO without a company to run. So he plays Mafia Wars on FaceBook. He's doing well-level 731. Thanks to FaceBook, I know he's playing about 18 hours a day. Andy, you've run four companies-and this is how you spend your downtime? What happned to golf?What happened to getting another job?
Take Liz. She is positive that the flu vaccine will kill us all and that we should avoid it. And then comes Chris who likes to post at least 20 times a day on every website he can find, so I get to read his thoughts twice, once on FaceBook and once on Twitter.
In real life, I don't see these sides of people. Face to face, my friends show me their best. They're nice, smart people. But face to FaceBook, my friends is like a blind date which goes horribly wrong.
I'm left with a dilemma. Who is my real friend?Is it the Liz I have lunch with or the anti-vaccine madman on FaceBook? Is it the Fred I can grab a sandwich with or the Fred who weeps if he's at a party and the wine isn't up to his standard?

A. present another side of people 
B. offer some foods for free 
C. show endless advertisements

Context: Father was a hardworking man who delivered bread as a living to support his wife and three children. He spent all his evenings after work attending classes, hoping to improve himself so that he could one day find a better paid job. Except for Sundays, Father hardly ate a meal together with his family. He worked and studied very hard because he wanted to provide his family with the best that money could buy. 
   Whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else. 
   The day came when the examination results were announced. To his joy, Father passed, and with distinctions too! Soon after, he was offered a good job as a senior supervisor which paid handsomely.
   Like a dream come true, Father could now afford to provide his family with life's little luxuries like nice clothing, fine food and vacation abroad.
   However, the family still did not get to see Father for most of the week. He continued to work very hard, hoping to be promoted to the position of manager. In fact, to make himself a worthily candidate for the promotion, he took another course in an open university.
   Again, whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else.
   Father's hard work paid off and he was promoted. Happily, he decided to hire a maid to relieve his wife from her domestic tasks. He also felt that their three-room flat was no longer big enough. It would be nice for his family to be able to enjoy the facilities and comfort of a condominium.    Having experienced the rewards of his hard work many times before, Father resolved to further his studies and work at being promoted again. The family still did not get to see much of him. In fact, sometimes Father had to work on Sundays entertaining clients.
   Over again, whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else.
   As expected, Father's hard work paid off again and he bought a beautiful condominium overlooking the coast of Singapore. On the first Sunday evening at their new home, Father declared to his family that he decided not to take any more courses or pursue any more promotions. From then on he was going to devote more time to his family, and it was a promise. 
   Father did not wake up the next day. 
 Question:Father worked and studied very hard because   _  . 
A. he had to support his family 
B. he wanted to bring his family a better life 
C. he was enthusiastic in attending classes 
D. he had to so as to reduce his family's complaint

Context: The day my husband fell to his death,it started to snow,just like any November day.His body,when I found it,was lightly covered with snow.It snowed almost every day for the next four months,while I sat on the couch and watched it pile up.One morning,I _ downstairs and was surprised to see a snow remover clearing my driveway and the bent back of a woman shoveling my walk.I dropped to my knees,crawled through the living room.And back up stairs so those good people would not see me.I was embarrassed.My first thought was,how would I ever repay them? I didn't have the strength to brush my hair let alone shovel someone's walk.
Before John's death,I took pride in the fact that I rarely asked for help or favors,I defined myself by my competence and independence.So who was I if I was no longer capable and busy? How could I respect myself if all I did was sit on the couch every day and watch the snowfall?
Learning how to receive the love and support that came my way wasn't easy.Friends cooked forme and l cried because I couldn't even help them set the table.""I'm not usually this lazy,""I wept.Finally,my friend Kathy sat down with me and said,""Mary,cooking for you is not a burden. I love you and I want to do it.It makes me feel good to be able to do something for you.""
Over and over,I heard similar emotions from the people who supported me during those dark days.One very wise man told me,""You are not doing nothing.Being fully open to your sorrow may be the hardest work you will everdo.""
I am not the person I once was,but in many ways I have changed for the better.My heart is now filled with thanks for people around me.I have been surprised to learn that there is incredible freedom that comes from facing one's worst fear and walking away whole.I believe there is strength,for sure,in accepting a dark period of our life. 
 Question:We can infer from the passage that   _  . 
A. the writer found her husband immediately he fell off the roof 
B. the writer became strong-willed immediately after John's death

Context: We usually believe what our brain tells us, but there are some amazing facts which show that the brain tricks us. As a result, we think we can see something that is not actually there or we ignore things that actually are there.

Each group had three members. Simons and Chabris asked the participants to count how many times the white team passed the ball. While the two teams were passing their balls around, a person dressed up as a big bear walked through the group and stopped to look at the camera. Simons and Chabris found that about half of the research participants did not notice the big bear. 
 Question:How many people did the experiment need in the video? 
A. Three. 
B. Four. 
C. Six.

Context: Ellen and Bill County are both teachers. They met in college and became good friends because of their shared love for children. Two years after the couple got married, Ellen saw a huge change in the life of one of her students, a 9 - year - old girl. Three years earlier both of the little girl's parents had died and there was no one to take care of her. She was taken away to live in a government office. But finally she was taken in and adopted by a family and became their daughter. Ellen said that she noticed the difference in the child's life after she was placed in a permanent home and thought that maybe she and her husband could help a child in a similar way.
They decided to become temporary parents and to take a child into their home just on the weekends when the real parents could not take care of him or her. The pair planned to have their own children in a few years, but decided that this would be a way to give to the community in the meantime.
The couple quickly grew to love one of the children they looked after. When he became legally available, Billy became the first child they took in permanently. Six months after adopting Billy, Ellen was told by her doctor that she was unable to have children naturally. Ellen says she knew then that adoption was the way she was meant to have a family.
Since adopting Billy, now 17, Ellen and Bill have adopted five more children -- Rose, 16; Albert, 11; Joshua, 5 and in June 2003, they added biological brother and sister Tyler and Rylee to the County family. The County family has been recognized for their work on adoption, and has received many awards for their efforts.  Last June,  the family was even interviewed on  the television show, ""Adoption Stories"".
Ellen says she would like to encourage other families to adopt children. She adds that the best part of being a mother of six is: ""Giving Josh a bath, putting a band-aid on a cut knee or just the everyday Mom things, that makes motherhood such an honor and a privilege."" 
 Question:Why did Ellen and Bill first decide to adopt a child? 
A. Because they had always loved students very much. 
B. Because they saw the benefits of adoption for a child. 
C. Because they were not able to have children of their own. 
D. Because they want to receive awards for their community work.

Tracy took photos of the dog and printed off 400 FOUND fliers , and put them in mailboxes.

At the time, Ann's son Thomas was 10 years old, and Jack, who was recovering from a heart operation, was 21 years old.
Four days later Ann was still looking after the dog, whom they had started to call Riley. When she arrived home from work, the dog threw itself against the screen door and barked madly at her.

Context: As I was thinking about language learning the other day, the image of baking bread came into my mind. I compared some of the exercises and drills that we put ourselves through in order to learn a language to the various ingredients  that go into baking a loaf of fresh bread.
Real language learning takes place in human relationships. No one sits down and eats a cup of flour, even if he is hungry and in a hurry. You don't become bilingual  by learning lists of vocabulary. You don't become a speaker of a language by memorizing verb conjugations   and agreement rules. You become bilingual by entering a community that uses that other language as its primary means of communication. 
I am not suggesting that we can make bread without ingredients. Flour is necessary, as are yeast , salt, water and other ingredients. Vocabulary is part of any language and will have to be learned. Grammatical rules exist in every language and cannot be ignored. But merely combining the appropriate ingredients in the recommended proportions does not result in bread. At best, you only end up with a ball of dough .
In order to get bread, you have to apply heat to the dough. And in language learning, that heat comes from the community. Anyone who has learned a second language has experienced that heat. It creeps up your neck when you ask the babysitter, ""Have you already been eaten?"" when you meant to say, ""Have you already eaten?"" When you try to say something quite innocent and the whole room bursts into laughter, you are experiencing the heat that turns raw dough into good bread.
Remember the old saying, ""If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen""? This is where language learning often breaks down because we find the heat uncomfortable and we stop the baking process. In order words, we can't stand the heat, so we get out of the kitchen.
However, the language learner who stays in the kitchen--in the heat--until the combined ingredients are thoroughly transformed will enjoy the richness of a quality loaf of bread. He is lad that he did not ""get out of the kitchen"" at the critical moment when the oven seemed too hot. The dedicated language learner knows that becoming bilingual cannot be achieved without the heat! 
 Question:The passage is mainly about   _  . 
A. how we can make baking bread with various ingredients 
B. how to become bilingual by communicating with others 
C. what an important role ""heat"" plays in learning a language 
D. what a high quality of bread you may achieve in the kitchen 
 Answer: C
Context: European Day of Languages falls on 26 September. BBC News Online reported the attitudes across several European Union countries to languages.
Tamsin Smith, Rome, Italy
Italians place very high importance on learning languages, particularly English. Twenty years ago it was quite difficult to find an English speaker here but today it is quite easy. The strong influence of American and English culture helps young people to learn the English language. They often become familiar with it through ""Harry Potter"" books or Disney movies. English schools, where Italian children are taught all their lessons in English, are also becoming popular among rich Italians.
Lucien Libert, Paris, France
Languages are very important in France. A good knowledge of the English language is necessary for many Frenchmen to get a good job and the more languages you can learn, the better. English is the first language you learn in school and you start very young. Most people have at least eight years of learning English at school. Learning German or Spanish comes next and Latin is also taught in most schools. While French people learn languages, there is also a movement to protect the French language.
James Helm, Dublin, Ireland
The English language predominates  in Ireland, but the ancient Irish language is a lasting source of pride and interest, and it remains a living tongue that is used in several areas. School are required to teach ancient Irish, and most students learn it as part of the subjects. There is a continuing discussion about how to protect the language best. In recent years some primary schools have introduced foreign language classes for younger students, and the Irish government has tried to encourage schools to offer more languages such as French, Spanish, German and Italian. 
 Question:What can help you get a better job in France? 
A. Studying abroad for at least one year. 
B. Learning English at younger ages. 
C. Knowing another language but French. 
D. Learning several languages well.

Based on the question, the option and the context select the most appropriate answer from the provided choices ""A."", ""B."", ""C."" and ""D."".
Context: Anne Whitney, a sophomore   at Colorado State University, first had a problem taking tests when she began college. ""I was always well prepared for my tests. Sometimes I studied for weeks before a test. Yet I would go in to take the test, only to find I could not answer the questions correctly. I would blank out because of nervousness and fear. I couldn't think of the answer. My low grades on the tests did not show what I knew to the teacher. ""Another student in biology had similar experiences. He said, ""My first chemistry test was very difficult. Then, on the second test, I sat down to take it, and I was so nervous that I was shaking. My hands were moving up and down so quickly that it was hard to hold my pencil. I knew the material and I knew the answers. Yet I couldn't even write them down!""
These two young students were experiencing something called test anxiety. Because a student worries and is uneasy about a test, his or her mind does not work as well as it usually does. The student cannot write or think clearly because of the extreme tension and nervousness. Contrary to people's common belief that poor grades are often a result of poor study habits, sometimes test anxiety plays a role in students' achieving low grades. Recently, test anxiety has been recognized as a real problem, not just an excuse or a false explanation of lazy students.
Special university advising courses try to help students. In these courses, advisors try to help students by teaching them how to manage test anxiety. At some universities, students take tests to measure their anxiety. If the tests show their anxiety is high, the students can take short courses to help them deal with their tensions. These courses teach students how to relax their bodies. Students are trained to become calm in very tense situations. By controlling their nervousness, they can let their minds work at ease. Learned information then comes out without difficulty on a test.
An expert at the University of California explains, "" With almost all students, relaxation and less stress are felt after taking our program. Most of them experience better control during their tests. Almost all have some improvement. With some, the improvement is very great. "" 
 Question:Poor grades are usually believed to be the result of  _  . 
A. poor sleeping habit 
B. laziness 
C. test anxiety 
D. inability to form good study habits

Context: Someone asked me, ""what do you think of youth?"" I showed him a can of COKE. See this?
""C"" means ""courage"". There's a seed in everyone's heart. As long as you really keep watering it, it will grow and harvest. Courage gives us the power to follow our dreams. Believe in yourself and be prepared for anything in the future.
""O"" stands for ""optimism"". When in trouble, some people feel disappointed but some people still keep their dreams. Be sure to choose the latter. Life is very much like a mirror. If you smile on it, it smiles back on you. If you frown, you will get a similar look in return. Throw away the sadness in your heart while filling it with brightness and hope.
""K"" can be understood as ""knowledge"". In order to keep up with the times, we should use knowledge to enrich ourselves. Knowledge is the food of thought and, as long as it is put in our brain, we will grow wiser.
""E"" is short for ""enthusiasm  "". Enthusiasm is the sign of youth. We use colourful paint-brushes in our hands to create the pictures of youth on our own. Let the sky and sea know we're young. Let out our enthusiasm wherever we go.
Drink a can of COKE. You will find your youth as refreshing   as a can of coke. Enjoy and value your youth.

Context: The accident at Lake Sherwood was in our backyard. An SUV had gone off the road,down a hill, and collided with a tree. When we heard the wreck, I remembered to say ""call 911"". My family was the first on the scene. Nick, my son, was on the cell phone with 911. He saw a friend who was a victim in the crash who was a 15 years old girl who was badly disfigured and had died instantly. It was a terrible scene.
There had been six people in the truck, all between 15 and 17 years old. My husband and I checked all the victims, and I picked one who was conscious and stayed with him. I talked with him and had him lay on the ground. When I asked him if he was hurt, he said he was sore all over. When help arrived, they asked me to stay and continue working with them. I did as Debbie Romine, .my instructor, said in class, and did what they wanted. They even said thank you before they left.
The sheriff deputies came by Saturday night to get our statements and play the 911 tape back, so Nick could identify all the voices in the background. They said over and over that the way he handled the call was the best they had heard in a long time. He was calm and worked with them even when he saw his friend who had died. The Sheriff's Department is sending some people over to help us work through our emotions.
The first aid and CPR course I took in January really helped me. I just didn't expect to put it to good use so soon.

Context: The Marches were a happy family. Poverty, hard work, and even the fact that Father March was away with the Union armies could not down the spirits of Meg, Jo, Amy, and Marmee, as the March girls called their mother.
The March sisters tried to be good but had their share of faults. Pretty Meg was often displeased with the schoolchildren she taught; boyish Jo was easy to become angry; golden-haired schoolgirl Amy liked to show up; but Beth, who kept the house, was loving and gentle always.
The happy days passed and darkness came when a telegram arrived for Mrs. March. ""Your husband is very ill,"" it said, ""come at once."" The girl tried to be brave when their mother left for the front. They waited and prayed. Little Beth got scarlet fever   when she was taking care of the sick neighbor. She became very ill but began to recover by the time Marmee was back. When Father came home from the front and at that joyful Christmas dinner they were once more all together.
Three years later the March girls had grown into young womanhood. Meg became Mrs. Brooke, and after a few family troubles got used to her new state happily. Jo had found pleasure in her literary efforts. Amy had grown into a young lady with a talent for design and an even greater one for society. But Beth had never fully regained her health, and her family watched her with love and anxiety.
Amy was asked to go and stay in Europe with a relative of the Marches. Jo went to New York and became successful in her writing and had the satisfaction of seeing her work published there. But at home the bitterest blow was yet to fall. Beth had known for some time that she couldn't live much longer to be with the family and in the spring time she died.
News came from Europe that Amy and Laurie, the grandson of a wealthy neighbor, had planned to be married soon. Now Jo became ever more successful in her writing and got married to Professor Bhaer and soon afterwards founded a school for boys.
And so the little women had grown up and lived happily with their children, enjoying the harvest of love and goodness that they had devoted all their lives to.

Context: A disheveled   man appeared in court Thursday on charges of murdering a Chinese woman whose fight with her attacker was seen on webcam  by her boyfriend in China. Police refused to release any details about the crime or its possible motive.
The body of York University student Liu Qian, 23, of Beijing, was found Friday in her apartment in Toronto a few hours after her boyfriend witnessed the attack, police said.
She was found undressed from the waist down but there were no obvious signs of sexual attack or trauma   severe enough to kill her. Police say it may be weeks before the results of an autopsy   are known.
Brian Dickson, 29, stood before the court in a wrinkled white shirt and blue jeans as a charge of first- degree murder was read out. He did not enter a plea. His case was held over until April 26.
Dickson was arrested Wednesday. Police only announced his name and his age and asked the media not to publish any photos of Dickson, saying it could compromise the investigation. Toronto police spokesman Tony Vella declined to respond to the request further.
Liu's father, Liu Jianhui, who arrived from China after being informed of his daughter's death, thanked authorities for their quick action.
""I sincerely thank the people concerned with my daughter's case,"" he told reporters after the arrest. ""Our daughter was studying very hard.""
Police released no motive or details about Dickson, but one friend described the Toronto man as _ .
Patricia Tomasi, a friend of Dickson's, told The Associated Press that she acted in a play at a local theater in Toronto with Dickson in 2007.
""He doesn't seem like the type but that's what they always say,"" Tomasi said. ""He's tall with boyish good looks. I don't know much about him except that he wanted to be an actor.""
Dickson attended York University where he studied global politics, but did not earn a degree from there.
He later worked for the Atlantic Council of Canada (ACC), where he served as an assistant to the president Juilie Lindhout. According to his biography on a newsletter from the Atlantic Council of Canada, Dickson has also been a running instructor and has been involved with Developments in Literacy, a Pakistani aid organization that raises money for children in Pakistan.
A statement from the Atlantic Council of Canada on Thursday said it was not council policy to comment on staff, but it confirmed that Dickson had been an intern  with the council from September 29, 2008, until March 27, 2009.
Liu was chatting with her boyfriend, Meng Xianchao, by webcam at about 1 am. Friday when a man knocked on the door, police said.
Meng reported seeing a struggle break out between the two before Liu's webcam was shut off. Meng contacted other friends in Toronto who in turn called police.
The victim's father, Liu Jianhui, said his daughter studied at Beijing City University before moving to Canada, where she met Meng.
Liu Qian's laptop computer, webcam and mobile phone were taken from the apartment the night of the attack, police said. Police said the online chat was on a live streaming camera and was not recorded, though investigators were trying to figure out if there was any way they could recover it.
York University, whose campus is located near one of Toronto's rougher neighborhoods, is one of Canada's largest universities with more than 53,000 undergraduate and graduate students. About 3,200 of York's students come from more than 150 foreign countries, the university's website says. 
 Question:What can be inferred from the text? 
A. Developments in Literacy raises money for all children 
B. Seeing the struggle, Meng contacted Toronto police. 
C. Dickson had no bad records before the murder. 
D. Investigators could recover the chat record online. 
 Answer: C
Context: COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A group of black parents and civil rights activists presented a petition  Thursday calling for officials to drop charges against a 16-year-old South Carolina high school student who was videotaped being dragged from her desk and thrown to the floor by a police officer in her classroom.
The group said it was unfair and unacceptable that the student and her 18-year-old classmate at Spring Valley High School who taped the incident were the only people charged that day when authorities already knew Richland County Deputy Ben Fields had tossed the girl from her desk to the ground.
They also said their petition had hundreds of thousands of names from around the country asking prosecutor Dan Johnson to drop the ""disturbing schools"" charges against the teens. The students in the case are black; Fields is white.
Johnson issued a statement Wednesday saying he won't do anything with the case until the FBI finishes its investigation into Fields, who was fired after the video became public. ""I do not simply decide cases based upon feelings, public opinion or sentiment, nor do I decide them based on political pressure,"" Johnson said in the statement.
Disturbing schools is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or 90 days in jail. The students' lawyer did not respond to telephone messages.
The video spread quickly across the country, prompting questions about when police officers should get involved with classroom discipline. Fields was called to the classroom after the student refused to stop using her cellphone, and then she would not leave the classroom for a teacher or administrator.
In the days after the incident, the teacher turned her class over to a substitute and the administrator was placed on leave. Richland two officials didn't respond to an email asking about their current status. The students were allowed back in school.
Organizers of the protest said they plan to be at South Carolina's Statehouse next year, calling for legislators to change the law that allows police officers to arrest students for misbehaving at schools. Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott blamed that law for escalating the situation. ""Let's find a way where we don't saddle students with arrest records,"" said EfiaNwangaza from the Malcom X Center for Self Determination. ""Let's get ahead of the schoolhouse-to-jailhouse train in South Carolina."" 
 Question:What is Don Johnson's attitude towards the case? 
A. Indifferent 
B. Ambiguous 
C. Subjective 
D. Cautious

Context: It all began with a stop at a red light.
Kevin Salwen was driving his 14-year-old daughter, Hannah, back from a sleepover in 2006 . While waiting at a traffic light, they saw a black Mercedes Coupe on one side and a homeless man begging for food on the other.
""Dad, if that man had a less nice car, that man there could have a meal.""Hannah protested. The light changed and they drove on, but Hannah was too young to be reasonable. She pestered  her parents about _ insisting that she wanted to do something.
""What do you want to do?"" her mom responded. ""Sell our house?""
Warning! _ . Hannah seized upon the idea of selling the luxurious family home and donating half the proceeds to charity, while using the other half to buy a more modest replacement home.
Eventually, that's what the family did. The project --crazy, impetuous   and utterly inspiring -- is written down in detail in a book by father and daughter scheduled to be published next month: ""The Power of Half."" It's a book that, frankly, I'd be nervous about leaving around where my own teenage kids might find it. An impressionable child reads this, and the next thing you know your whole family is out on the street.
At a time of enormous needs in Haiti and elsewhere, when so many Americans are trying to help Haitians by sending everything from text messages to shoes, the Salwens offer an example of a family that came together to make a difference -- for themselves as much as the people they were trying to help. In a column a week ago, it described neurological evidence from brain scans that unselfishness lights up parts of the brain normally associated with more primary satisfaction. The Salwens' experience confirms the selfish pleasures of selflessness.
Mr. Salwen and his wife, Joan, had always assumed that their kids would be better off in a bigger house. But after they downsized, there was much less space to retreat to, so the family members spent more time around each other. A smaller house unexpectedly turned out to be a more family-friendly house. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage? 
A. Mercedes Coupe is only an ordinary car which is quite cheap. 
B. Unselfishness has nothing to do with people's primary satisfaction. 
C. Hannah asked her parents to do something charitable and they sold their house. 
D. The writer's children asked him to sell their house. 
 Answer: C

His Apple Computer was so successful that Steven Jobs soon became famous all over the world.
He often said, ""I live in order to change the world, there aren't any other reasons. The only way to have a great achievement is to love your own career. If you can't find your favorite career, go on looking for it and never give up.""

Context: It was a long process that involved creating a resume, submitting an online application  and attending a round of interviews. Naturally Tan Kaiyin, a 21-year-old student is excited when she was selected, as more than 660, 000 people signed up to volunteer at the 16thAsian Games in Guangzhou, but only less than 10 percent were finally chosen to work in the venues and wear the white and green sport uniforms.
Like in any major sporting event, volunteers play a vital role in assisting with operations and Tan's function here is not any different. She is based at the Garden Hotel and is tasked with helping guests and officials who have issues with their accreditation cards . ""I deal with guests from all over the world, I have never met so many international people and it is very, very exciting to have this opportunity to interact with them. They come to the office because they need to make a change in their accreditation card and usually they are in a hurry, so we try our best to get it done quickly."" 
She admits the first few days involved extremely long hours, however she likes the challenge as it gives her an immense sense of satisfaction especially when an irate guest turns a frown into a smile and says ""thank you"". 
Tan deals with people from different cultures and personalities and feels she has learned so much in the past week, an experience that she would have never gotten if not for the Guangzhou Asian Games, therefore she is very happy and grateful for being a part of this. She also has kind words for her managers and fellow colleagues and says the hard work and positive atmosphere has bonded them into a family. She enjoys her responsibilities so much that she is afraid of feeling lost when the Games finally end on Nov. 27. 
However, she is aware of all the positive effects the Games have had on Guangzhou. From improvements to air and water quality to better transportation and infrastructure in the city, but most importantly to her is the fact that the Asian Games has placed Guangzhou prominently onto the world map. This, she believes, will encourage people from all over the world to continue visiting her city, and this in turn will give the residents of Guangzhou a fantastic opportunity to continue learning about different cultures. The official Asian Games Volunteer Slogan is, ""Together, we can make it better!"" Indeed it seems they can.

B. Asian Games has place Guangzhou prominently onto the world map. 
C. The Game will give the residents of Guangzhou a fantastic opportunity to continue learning about different cultures.

Context: Our three-year-old daughter Becky wanted a dog. But we were too busy to buy one. One day, Becky ran in, shouting, ""Mom! Come to see my dog!"" Her face was red with excitement.
I followed her to the bush and found a wolf! He was hurt. Seeing me, he stood up suddenly! I could see his teeth! God! My mouth _ . ""Don't be afraid. That's Mom. She loves you, too."" Becky said. Then he became friendly. It was unbelievable!
I rushed to find my husband and told him about the wolf. We should have killed the wolf, but Becky loved him. Besides, he was kind to Becky. So we called the vet  finally.

On Becky's first day of school, we could see Ralph's sadness. After Becky left school, Ralph lay by the side of the road and waited. When Becky returned, he got happy again. This continued throughout Becky's school years.

Becky cried. I noticed something strange in the bush--two little yellow eyes! Ralph's child! Before he died, Ralph brought his child to us! He knew he would be safe here, as he had been. Ralph, Ralph, I was moved.

Later that day I saw Mary and said, ""I saw you out there walking a dog this morning. Are you unhappy because you had to walk it on such a cold day?"" To my surprise, she said that she enjoyed getting out there and walking the dog and that she got good exercise because of the dog. She also said she had talked to her brother, the dog's owner, who was on holiday in Orlando, Florida with his family. He said his children were enjoying Disney World and the resorts  . His four-year-old son had breakfast with Mickey Mouse and said it was the best day in his life. Mary said, ""If I can help my brother and his family have a wonderful time relaxing for a week, knowing that their pet is being loved and cared for, what more could I ask for?""

Context: Every day as I drove through town, I saw a one-legged man going through the dustbins next to McDonalds looking for food. It was only a month before Christmas, starting to get cold and I could not help thinking about him.
So I bought a brush, pack of cigarettes, cans of fish, and then I added a blanket and sweatshirts. I made a box up like a present and went in search of this man. I saw him hobble   away from the dustbin. I pulled over, took the box and went up to him. I said, ""I would like to give you a Christmas present, there are some food items in here and some things you might be able to use.""
He sidestepped around me and said, ""No, thank you. I just had lunch. I don't need anything."" Then he hobbled on down the sidewalk, leaving me standing there in tears. I took the box down to a little shop that gave things out to the poor and homeless and told them what had happened and asked them to give the box to someone who could use it. The person there told me not to be upset and let my feelings be hurt as I was still crying. I told her I was not crying for me but for him because what I had done took away his dignity by treating him like a person in need. I was so ashamed.
A few years later I was able to volunteer in St. Anthony's Dining Room in San Francisco. These people had to stand in line for up to 6 hours to receive the only food they will get. We took one tray   of food at a time, and treated them as if they were in a restaurant ordering a meal they were paying for. 
From this I learned a great lesson. Accepting help is sometimes harder than giving it. 
 Question:The man refused to get the present because he   _  . 
A. had just had lunch 
B. didn't need anything right now 
C. didn't know the author 
D. wanted to maintain his dignity 
 Answer: D
Context: One night there was a woman at the airport who had to wait for several hours before getting her next flight. While waiting, she bought a book and a pack of biscuits to spend the time. She looked for a place to sit and waited. She was reading her book, when suddenly she realized that there was a young man sitting next to her who was stretching his hand, and grabbing the pack of cookies lying between them. He started to eat them one by one. Not wanting to make a fuss about it ,she decided to ignore him. The woman ate the biscuits and watched the clock, while the young thief was also eating them. The woman started to think, ""If I weren't such a good and educated person, I would have hit this man by now.""
Every time she ate a biscuit, he had one, too. The dialogue between their eyes continued and when only one biscuit was left, she wondered what he was going to do. Softly and with a nervous smile, the young man grabbed the last biscuit and broke it into two. He offered one half to the woman while he ate the other half. Briskly she took the biscuit and thought, ""What a bad man! How uneducated! He didn't even thank me!""
She had never met anybody who made her so angry, and was pleased when her flight was ready. She grabbed her bags and went towards the gate not looking back to where that thief was seated. After getting on the plane and being seated, she looked for her book which was almost finished by now. While looking into her bag she was totally surprised to find her pack of biscuits. ""If my biscuits are here,"" she thought, feeling bad, ""those others were his and he tried to share them with me.""Too late to say sorry to the young man, she realized with pain, that it was her who had been an uneducated thief, but not him.

Context: We always celebrated Dad's birthday on Thanksgiving Day, even after he entered a nursing home. When we knew it might be his last birthday, the whole family decided to get together for a huge birthday celebration at the nursing home.
Dad was a good storyteller and we were always his listeners. During a quiet moment, I announced it was now Dad's turn to listen to stories for a change. I wanted everyone to tell Dad what we loved about him. The room became quiet. Then one after another, people told stories from their hearts, while Dad listened with tears in eyes.
Everyone seemed to have more than one story. Even the little grandchildren couldn't wait to tell Dad why they loved him. For a man who had been kind to so many hundreds of people in his life, here was our chance to tell him how much we love him. A few months later, at Dad's memorial service, we more fully realized what we had given to Dad that night. Those are the stories people normally tell at a funeral   after a loved one is no longer alive to hear the words. They tell stories, full of tears. But we had given those memories to Dad in his life, and we had told them through laughter, together with hugs and joy. He had them to hold and enjoyed them from time to time in his mind during his last days and months.
Words do matter, and they are enough. We just need to say them or to speak them publicly the ones we love. That's the ways to give back love and that's our chance to celebrate a person in his or her life.

As Amy Paul choked  on a piece of apple at her home, her dog jumped up, landing hard on her chest and forcing the piece in her throat out. When the Keesling family of Indiana was about to be killed by carbon monoxide, their cat clawed at the wife Cathy's hair until she woke up and called for help.

Context: Listening to music while you drive can improve your speed and ability to get away from accidents, according to Australian psychologists. But turning your car radio up to full volume could probably make you end up in an accident. The performance of difficult tasks can be influenced if people are subjected to loud noise. The experience of pulling up at traffic lights alongside cars with loud music made some psychologists in the University of Sydney look into whether loud music has something to do with driving. 
The psychologists invited 60 men and women aged between 20 and 28 as subjects and tested them on almost the same driving tasks under three noise conditions: silence, rock music played at a gentle 55 decibels  , and the same music at 85 decibels.
For 10 minutes the subjects sat in front of a screen operating a simple machine like a car. They had to track   a moving disk on screen, respond to traffic signals changing color1, and brake in response to arrows that appeared without warning.
On the tracking task, there was no difference in performance under the three noise conditions. But under both the loud and quiet music conditions, the performers ""braked"" at a red light about 50 milliseconds sooner than they did when there was no rock music at all. That could mean a reduction in braking distance of a couple of meters actually, the difference between life and death for a pedestrian.
When it came to the arrows that appeared across the visual field, the psychologists found that when the music was quiet, people responded faster to objects in their central field of sight by about 50 milliseconds. For the people listening at 85 decibels, response times were dropped by a further 50 milliseconds -- a whole tenth of second faster than those ""driving"" with no music. 
 ""But there's a trade-off,"" the psychologists told the European Congress of Psychology. ""They lose the ability to look around the whole situation effectively."" In responding to objects that suddenly appeared, people subjected to 85-decibel rock music were around 100 milliseconds slower than both the other groups. Since some accidents -- such as children running into the road -- take place without any notice, drivers listening to loud music must be less safe as a result. 
 Question:On the whole, which of the following is the best way to make driving safer? 
A. Loud music. 
B. Quiet music. 
C. Silence. 
D. Heavy metal music. 
 Answer: B
Context: The week after Jane's birthday, Barbara and Mary were away. Jane decided to have a late birthday party. She telephoned several friends. She asked some to bring records, some to bring food and others to bring something to drink. She rang another friend to see if she could borrow his record player. She herself bought some food and drink to get the party going. She took up all the carpets   so that they could dance. She did not know whether Barbara and Mary would have approved  , but as long as she was careful, she was sure that they would not mind. She warned the two people in the flat above and invited them down. 
""Oh, "" said Jane, surprised. ""What's all this about? ""
The first guests arrived soon after eight. The music was soon playing loudly and they started dancing. Some of Jane's friends brought other friends with them. As more and more people arrived,the noise increased. People started shouting at each other, so they turned the music up. This made it more difficult to hear each other above the music, so they shouted more loudly. At half past ten the bell rang. ""Turn down the music!"" someone shouted. ""Someone probably called the police."" When Jane opened the door, there was a policeman standing there. She started to apologize, ""I'm sorry about all the noise, officer. But you see, it was my birthday last week and I'm having a party."" ""Never mind about that, miss. We're here because of something much more important.""
""Well, there's been a report of burglary  . We think the thief may have come to your party, pretending to be a friend of someone here. ""

Context: Bobbi Kristina Brown's family has been gathered around her since she was hospitalized on Saturday after being found unconscious in the bathtub of her suburban Atlanta townhome.
Whitney Houston's only child is now at Emory University Hospital and is still fighting for her life, as a family statement said on Monday.
Nothing has changed, despite reports that are popping up and painting a more serious picture.
Fox News reported Wednesday that the situation is horrific. ""It's now a matter of when the family wants to let go and accept that she's pretty much not going to make it,"" a source told FOX411. ""They've left it up to the family as to how long they want to keep her alive.""
People Magazine is also reporting that a doctor told Brown's family on Wednesday that nothing more could be done. ""Everyone is coming to the hospital to say goodbye,"" said a family member.
And the Daily Mail says Brown has been taken off life support.
But Bobby Brown issued a statement late Thursday denying these reports.
""If we issued a statement every time the media published a false report regarding this matter, that's all we would be doing 24 hours a day. This is false, just as is the vast majority of the other reporting that is currently taking place,"" he said, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.
A source close to the family tells USA TODAY that it's wrong to say the family is gathering to say goodbye, because the family has been there since the beginning, so nothing is any different today for them.
Also, Brown is ""not brain dead,"" as has been reported.
And, as for other stories saying that the Houston family is feuding with Bobbi Kristina's dad, Bobby Brown? Those aren't true either. They ""are NOT fighting,"" says our source. 
 Question:Which can be the best title of the passage? 
A. An Accident In The Bathtub 
B. Kristina, We're Still Praying And Waiting On A Miracle 
C. False Reports From Different News Media 
D. Bobbi Kristina's Final Days

Context: Anne Whitney, a sophomore   at Colorado State University, first had a problem taking tests when she began college. ""I was always well prepared for my tests. Sometimes I studied for weeks before a test. Yet I would go in to take the test, only to find I could not answer the questions correctly. I would blank out because of nervousness and fear. I couldn't think of the answer. My low grades on the tests did not show what I knew to the teacher. ""Another student in biology had similar experiences. He said, ""My first chemistry test was very difficult. Then, on the second test, I sat down to take it, and I was so nervous that I was shaking. My hands were moving up and down so quickly that it was hard to hold my pencil. I knew the material and I knew the answers. Yet I couldn't even write them down!""
These two young students were experiencing something called test anxiety. Because a student worries and is uneasy about a test, his or her mind does not work as well as it usually does. The student cannot write or think clearly because of the extreme tension and nervousness. Contrary to people's common belief that poor grades are often a result of poor study habits, sometimes test anxiety plays a role in students' achieving low grades. Recently, test anxiety has been recognized as a real problem, not just an excuse or a false explanation of lazy students.
Special university advising courses try to help students. In these courses, advisors try to help students by teaching them how to manage test anxiety. At some universities, students take tests to measure their anxiety. If the tests show their anxiety is high, the students can take short courses to help them deal with their tensions. These courses teach students how to relax their bodies. Students are trained to become calm in very tense situations. By controlling their nervousness, they can let their minds work at ease. Learned information then comes out without difficulty on a test.
An expert at the University of California explains, "" With almost all students, relaxation and less stress are felt after taking our program. Most of them experience better control during their tests. Almost all have some improvement. With some, the improvement is very great. "" 
 Question:Poor grades are usually believed to be the result of  _  . 
A. poor sleeping habit 
B. laziness 
C. test anxiety 
D. inability to form good study habits 
 Answer: D
Context: Today's the day of a big test at school, and you feel awful. Your stomach hurts and you have a headache. Some people might feel their hearts beating quickly while they are waiting for the test paper. A student with really strong test _ may even feel like he or she might be sick or throw up .
Sound familiar? You'll find that just about all people--adults and others--have some anxiety before a test. According to studies, proper anxiety can be helpful, keeping you sharp and focused and even helping you get good grades. But when you have so much anxiety or feel so sick that you can't do well in your studies or tests, that's bad for your studies or your body health.
Of course, if you don't study for the test, you might be worried. That kind of anxiety isn't easy to deal with because even if you find a way to calm down, you still might not know what to do with it. When you are preparing for a test and you get a handle on your test, you will be able to let your knowledge work well and get good grades.
For example, last Wednesday was the day of a big test at school. Jane felt awful. Her stomach hurt and she had a headache. She knew she hadn't caught a cold--but only a little nervous about the test. She really didn't know why. 
 Question:When you feel too nervous in a test, you may  _  . 
A. improve yourself 
B. fail in the test

Context: Weighed down by study? Pushed to the limit by the fast pace of life ? Frightened by the possible war ? Well, you're not alone. Men and women in France are seeking relief using the world's best medicine-----laughter.
In the past year, more than 15 laughter clubs have been set up across the country. People of all ages go to release their stress with an hour group laughs. ""People telephoned me and said they have forgotten what it is to laugh. They want to find a place where they can escape all their problems for a while. So they come,"" said 40--year--old Jocelyne Le Moan. She usually takes a class of around 60 people through a series of laughter techniques.
Her pupils range from teenagers to 70 years old, but most are middle---aged white collars seeking 60 minutes of relaxation at the end of a busy day. Le Moan takes them through the ""Lion Laugh""and the ""Laugh Contest"", where participants ""speak""to each other in different ways. And instead of talking, they break into fits of laughter. At the end there are 15 minutes of ""meditation"", when they lie on their backs and let the laughs burst out of their mouths.

The audience sat quietly while he makes his way across the stage to his chair and begins his play.But this time,something went wrong.Just as he finished the first few bars,one of the strings on his violin broke.We thought that he would have to stop the concert.But he didn't.Instead,he waited a moment,closed his eyes and then signaled the conductor to begin again.
Of course,anyone knows that it is impossible to play a pleasant work with just three strings.I know that,and you know that,but that night Itzhak Perlman refused to know that.
When he finished,there was a breathtaking silence in the room.And then people rose and cheered.There was an extraordinary outburst of applause from every corner of the auditorium.
He smiled,wiped the sweat from this brow and then he said-not proudly,but in a quiet,holy attitude-""You know,sometimes it is the artist's task to find out how much music you can still make with what you have left.""
This powerful line has stayed in my mind ever since I heard it.And who knows?Perhaps that is the meaning of life-not just for artists but for all of us.
So,perhaps our task in this fastchanging,puzzling world in which we live is to make music,at first with all that we have,and then,when that is no longer possible,to make music with what we have left. 
 Question:What made Itzhak Perlman's performance at the concert special on Nov.18,1995? 
A. There were too many audience. 
B. He was late for the stage. 
C. He had a quarrel with the audience. 
D. One string of the violin got broken.

Context: ""It's over!Thank goodness!""
   School was over and I was tired.I sat at the front of the school bus.
   Janie,the driver,tries to break the uncomfortable atmosphere by striking the match of talks.I try to listen politely,but usually I am too busy thinking about my day.On this day,however,her talk was worth listening to.
   ""My father is ill,:she said to no one in particular.I could see worry in her eyes.I had never seen her like this before.She always meets students with a smile.
   With a sudden change of interest,I asked,""What's wrong with him?""
   With her eyes wet and her voice unusual,she answered,""Heart trouble.""Her eyes lowered as she continued,""I have already lost my mum,so I don't think I can stand losing him.""I couldn't answer.My heart ached for her.
   I sat on the seat thinking of great pain my own mother was thrown into when her father died.I saw how hard it was,and still is,for her.I wouldn't want anyone to go through that.
   Suddenly I realised Janie was not only a bus driver,that was just for her job.She had a whole world of family and cares too.
   I suddenly felt very selfish.I paid no attention to Janie because she was a bus driver,I had judged her by her joband brushed her off as unimportant.I shouldn't have been so selfish and self-centered.

Context: For the 17 years my life was very happy. Then the first sad thing happened. My mother became very ill, and soon she knew that she was dying. Just before she died, she asked Elizabeth and me to go to her room. She held our hands and said, ""Victor and Elizabeth, my children, I'm very happy because you love each other, and because one day you'll get married. Everyone in the family loves you, Elizabeth. Will you take my place in the family, my dear? I can die happy if you look after them when I have gone.""
My mother died and we were very sad, because we loved her dearly. Elizabeth was brave and helped us; her sweet smile gave us some happiness in the unhappy days after my mother's death. The time came for me to go to university. I didn't want to leave my sad family, but we all knew that I should go. It was hard to leave, too, because the parents of my good friend Henry would not let him go to university with me. So I had gone alone.
On my first day at university I met my teacher, Professor Waldman, who was one of the greatest scientists in the world. He gave a wonderful talk to all the students who were starting at the university. He ended his talk by saying, ""Some of you will become the greatest scientists of tomorrow. You must study hard and discover everything that you can. This is why God made you intelligent--to help other people.""
After the professor's talk, I thought very carefully. I remembered the storm when I was 15; I remembered how the lightning had destroyed the tree. From then on, I wanted to use electricity to help people, and I wanted to discover the secrets of life. I decided to work on these two things.
I started to work the next day. I worked very hard and soon Professor Waldman and I realized that I could learn to be a very good scientist.
The professor helped me very much, and other important scientists who were his friends helped me, too. I was interested in my work and I did not take one day's holiday during the next two years, I did not go home, and my letters to my family were very short.
After two years, I had discovered many things and I built a scientific machine that was the best in the university. My machine would help me answer the most important question of all. How does life begin? Is it possible to put life into dead things? To answer these questions about life I had to learn first about death. I had to watch bodies from the moment when they died and the warm life left them. In the hospital and in the university, I watched the dying and the dead. Day after day, month after month, I followed death, so it was a dark and terrible time.
I built a tall mast about 150 meters high, which is higher than the tallest building in the city, to catch lightning and send the electricity down to my machine in the lab. I believed I could use that electricity to give life to things that were dead.
Then one day, the answer came to me. Suddenly I was sure that I knew the secret of life. 
 Question:According to the author, the secret of life is to  _  . 
A. give life to things that were dead 
B. use electricity to help others 
C. build the best machine to learn about death 
D. become the greatest scientist of tomorrow

Context: I'm Bessy. I began to learn English in Grade 6,not like most of my friends who have been learning English since kindergarten( ) or at least in Grade 3.I fell in love with this foreigner language at once. As an old saying goes, ""Interest is the best teacher."" I began to be crazy about English. I learned words and grammar, made sentences, wrote essays and read English storybo oks as many as I could.
Some of my friends find it easy to forget the words they learned the other day. So do I! You can't remember words well without using them often. So you should turn to a dictionary for help when you meet new words and want to know their other meanings and usages. Then make your own sentences from time to time.Another way to keep new words in mind is reading articles. You can easily remember new words through _ 
As for spoken English, I'm lucky to have some foreign friends. So I have more chances to improve my spoken English. If you want to communicate with foreigners, don't be shy, and just practice with anyone who knows English. 
 Question:Which way of memorizing English words is NOT mentioned? 
A. Turning to a dictionary 
B. Making word cards 
C. Making sentences 
D. Reading articles 
 Answer: B
Context: Many students ask for advice about improving their English. There are three basic questions.
The first question is about real English. Li Hao from Hubei wrote, ""I enjoy watching English films and listening to real English songs. But it takes a long time. What do you think?""
This is a great way to learn English! Talk about the film or song with your friends, and guess the meaning of the new words. Just enjoy yourself!
The second question is about speaking. Sam, from Suzhou wrote. ""Our school has a foreign teacher. But I'm shy and can't speak to her. What should I do?""
When I visit China, lots of people in the street say, ""Hello! How are you? Where are you from? Do you like China?"" These are good questions to start a talk. Many people are shy when they speak English, so before you begin, take a deep breath and smile! Smiling always helps.
The third question is about vocabulary. Oliver, from Anhui wrote, ""I want to remember all the new words. I write them down, but I forget them quickly. What should I do?""
Try to remember eight or ten words a day. Write them on pieces of paper and place them in your bedroom. Say the words when you see them, and change them every day. And when you're  shopping, how about counting the English words, or saying the English names for everything you see? 
 Question:What is Oliver's problem? 
A. He's too shy to talk with others. 
B. He's not able to count English words. 
C. He can't remember new words. 
D. He doesn't know what real English is.

Context: The girl was hanging by her hands from the railings of a balcony . The balcony was on the twelfth floor of the high-rise block next to his. His flat was on the ninth floor and he had to look up to see her. It was half-past six in the morning. He had been awakened by the sound of an aircraft flying dangerously low overhead, and had got out of bed to look. His sleepy eyes, moved from the blue sky which was empty of cloud, empty of anything but the bright disappearing arrow of the aircraft, and then rested on the hanging figure.
He really thought he must be dreaming, for this sunrise time was the hour for dreams. Then, when he knew he wasn't, he decided it must be a scene in a film. There were cameramen down there, a whole film unit, and all the correct safety precautions had been taken. Probably the girl wasn't even a real girl, but a dummy . He opened the window and looked down. The car park, paved courts, grass spaces between the blocks, all were deserted. On the balcony rail one of the dummy's hands moved, desperately. He had to believe then what was obviously happening. The girl was trying to kill herself. She had lost her courage and now was trying to stay alive. All these thoughts and conclusions of his occupied about thirty seconds. Then he acted. He picked up the phone and dialed the emergency number for the police.
The arrival of the police cars and the rescue of the girl became the focus of talk for the people of the two blocks. Someone found out that it was he who had called the police and he became an unwilling hero. He was a modest, quiet young man, and was in relief when the talk began to die away. Again he was able to enter and leave his flat without being pointed at as a kind of St George and sometimes even congratulated.
About a fortnight after that morning, he was getting ready to go to the theatre, just putting on his overcoat, when the doorbell rang. He didn't recognize the girl who stood outside. He had never seen her face. She said, ""I'm Lydia Simpson. You saved my life. I've come to thank you.""

Context: Linda was kind of late. Linda, 25, had a lot to do at work, plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Linda felt weak and tired -- maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks.
Several yards away, Frank, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying.
But when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, ""Oh, my God, she fell in!""Frank didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. ""No ! Not you ! ""his girlfriend screamed after him.
She was right to be alarmed. By the time Frank reached Linda, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station.
It was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the arms and drag her away from the edge. That was where Linda briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse.
Linda thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in.
Police and fire officials soon arrived, and Frank told the story to an officer. Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40minute train ride downtown--just as he had been seconds after the rescue, which made her think about her reaction at the time. ""I saw the train coming and I was thinking he was going to die, "" she explained. 
 Question:How did Frank save Linda? 
A. By helping her rise to her feet. 
B. By lifting her to the platform. 
C. By pulling her along the ground.

Context: Did you know that a turtle can lay 12 eggs in one minute? A large sea turtle lays around 150 eggs at a time. She lays all these eggs in just a few minutes.
Large sea turtles live in the warm seas of the world. Except for when they lay their eggs, they spend their whole lives in the water. When it is time to lay their eggs, the females  swim to land.
They usually return to the place where they themselves were born. How they find their way back there is unknown.
When they reach shore, the big, heavy turtles crawl slowly up to the high water mark. Using their flippers, they pull themselves along the sand. They must struggle like mountain climbers.
When they finally reach dry sand, they rest before beginning the difficult task of laying eggs.
The turtles lay the eggs in deep holes and cover them with warm sand. The sand protects the eggs from harm. Then the females leave them. After a few weeks, if you happened to be walking along the beach, you might see the sand begin to shake. You may see tiny black balls coming out of the sand. The tiny heads of baby turtles!

We rushed the patient to the hospital, but despite our efforts, we were unable to save his life.
In my line of life, I rarely get any recognition from the patients we treat, or from their loved ones. But that night, a man's wife approached us, and through her tears, whispered, ""Thank you."" Then she hugged each of us. She knew we answered her late-night call for help, even though the ending was not positive.
There is something deeply rewarding about helping people in these circumstances. Sometimes, I'm able to make their worst day a bit better: like seeing the tears of an injured child turn into a smile when I gave him an interesting toy; or watching a terrified mother's screams turn into tears of joy when she realized her baby was going to be fine.
Experiences like these allow me to see the impact my work has on others. At the same time, I also know the effect _ has had on my own life. As a teenager, I felt awkward when my dad hugged me and said, "" I love you, my dear son."" I was equally uncomfortable and responded, ""I love you."" But then I imagined him lying on the kitchen floor that rainy night and realized that my opportunity to say those three words could---at any moment---be taken away forever. Now, I extremely treasure the moment when my father says those three words to me. I've learned to appreciate every relationship I have, to tell people I care about them, and to never take anything in life for granted. 
 Question:The author mentioned the injured child and the terrified mother to show that  _  . 
A. Life was not always pleasant 
B. His help could bring people happiness 
C. He saved a lot of people 
D. They were very grateful to him 
 Answer: B
Context: The day my husband fell to his death,it started to snow,just like any November day.His body,when I found it,was lightly covered with snow.It snowed almost every day for the next four months,while I sat on the couch and watched it pile up.One morning,I _ downstairs and was surprised to see a snow remover clearing my driveway and the bent back of a woman shoveling my walk.I dropped to my knees,crawled through the living room.And back up stairs so those good people would not see me.I was embarrassed.My first thought was,how would I ever repay them? I didn't have the strength to brush my hair let alone shovel someone's walk.
Before John's death,I took pride in the fact that I rarely asked for help or favors,I defined myself by my competence and independence.So who was I if I was no longer capable and busy? How could I respect myself if all I did was sit on the couch every day and watch the snowfall?
Learning how to receive the love and support that came my way wasn't easy.Friends cooked forme and l cried because I couldn't even help them set the table.""I'm not usually this lazy,""I wept.Finally,my friend Kathy sat down with me and said,""Mary,cooking for you is not a burden. I love you and I want to do it.It makes me feel good to be able to do something for you.""
Over and over,I heard similar emotions from the people who supported me during those dark days.One very wise man told me,""You are not doing nothing.Being fully open to your sorrow may be the hardest work you will everdo.""
I am not the person I once was,but in many ways I have changed for the better.My heart is now filled with thanks for people around me.I have been surprised to learn that there is incredible freedom that comes from facing one's worst fear and walking away whole.I believe there is strength,for sure,in accepting a dark period of our life. 
 Question:We can infer from the passage that   _  . 
A. the writer found her husband immediately he fell off the roof 
B. the writer became strong-willed immediately after John's death 
C. the people around the writer were friendly and supported her

Context: Janice is an American engineer working in Nanjing. She and her husband George, who is teaching English at a university, have been eager to get to know Chinese people better, so they were pleased when Liu, Janice's young co-worker, invited them to her home for dinner.
When they arrived, Liu introduced them to her husband Yang and asked them to sit down at a table containing eight plates of various cold dishes. Half an hour later she came back and sat down and the three began to eat. Yang came in from time to time, putting hot dishes on the table. Most of the food was wonderful, though neither George nor Janice could eat the fatty pork, and there was much more than they could eat. They kept wishing Yang would sit down so they could talk to him. Finally he did sit down to eat a bit, but soon it was time to go home.
Janice and George felt slightly depressed by this experience, but returned the invitation two weeks later. They decided to make a nice American meal and felt lucky to find olives, crackers , tomato juice, and even some cheese in the shop. They put these out as appetizers . For the main course they prepared spaghetti and a salad.
When Liu and Yang arrived and began to have dinner, they took small tastes of the appetizers and seemed surprised when both George and Janice sat down with them. They ate only a little spaghetti and didn't finish the salad on their plates. After a while, George cleared the table and served coffee and pastries . Yang and Liu each put four spoons of sugar into their coffee but didn't drink much of it and ate only a bite or two of pastry.
After they left, George and Janice were upset. "" We left their place so full but they're going to have to eat again when they get home. What went wrong?

Context: Having put down your pens at the end of the college entrance exam, you have ended 12 years of hard study. Forget your studies for a while. It's time to enjoy yourselves!
There are many ways to celebrate this special month of graduation. You can have photos taken with your classmates and teachers, or dine out together and exchange gifts.
High school students in Western countries such as the United States and Canada usually have a prom to mark their graduation. It's to mark the time kids turn into young men and women. After the prom, teenagers either go to college or find a job. It means they are no longer as dependent on their parents as they were before.
At the prom, boys usually dress in dinner jackets and bow ties, though many different types of formal clothes are worn. Traditionally, girls give boys matching boutonnieres ( ). Girls traditionally wear formal dresses, or dress to shock or be noticed, in shiny or brightly colored materials.
Common prom activities include dining, dancing, the crowning   of a prom king and queen, and just talking to friends.  In some cases, high school students collect funds for their class prom through the four years of their high school.
High schools in or near large cities may rent ballrooms at expensive hotels or, to be unusual, in a pleasure cruise boat.
But often costs are cut by simply using the school gym. Students make a lot of effort to decorate the gym to make the event special. The music played at the prom will be the most popular kinds, like rock and hip-hop.
The students elect the Prom Queen. She is partnered with a Prom King who is elected similarly. These are great honors that the pair take very seriously. The two dance with each other to celebrate their election. 
 Question:What clearly indicates that prom is very important to students? 
A. Music is played at the prom. 
B. They take pictures at the prom. 
C. The King and Queen dance with each other. 
D. They wear formal clothes or special clothes.

Context: For every woman who feels like she's had to scale back her personal ambitions since becoming a mother, gold medal cyclist Kristin Armstrong has a message: Don't give up on your dreams.
She retired after winning gold in Beijing to start a family; son Lucas arrived in 2010, but then she decided to compete again in the London Olympics. She won a gold medal at last.
The decision to start training again wasn't easy. ""I struggled with that a lot,"" she told a newspaper. ""At the beginning I felt selfish, I felt like, 'Well, I'm not supposed to be thinking of myself anymore. It's all supposed to be for my kid.'""
She faced physical challenges of getting back into competition shape after giving birth, as well. When she started racing in the spring of 2011, she was still breast-feeding; she would nurse her son, then race, then breast-feed again after the race. Her days revolved around Lucas and training.
""I feel like I'm able to do what I love to do and still manage a family and have that balance,"" Armstrong said. ""That you have a family or a child doesn't mean that you have to stop going after what you dream of individually.""
Armstrong makes balance look easy, whether it's on her bike or as an athlete-mom. But she points out that you can't have it all without making some sacrifices. For example, don't expect a neat home--her husband, Joe Savola, who she describes as her support system and her ""protector"", says he's had to give up on trying to keep everything orderly at home and just accept that their living room has become Lucas's playroom. For Armstrong, she's sacrificed time with friends who had kids around the same age--there just wasn't time.
Now, she says, ""That sounds like fun to me."" As she heads home to Boise, Idaho, she's ready to do regular mom stuff. 
 Question:In most days of 2011, Armstrong could be described as   _  . 
A. a housewife and a new mom 
B. an athlete and a career woman 
C. a parent and a sportswoman 
D. a wife and a good mother 
 Answer: C
Context: Mothers and daughters go through so much--yet when was the last time a mother and daughter sat down to write a book together about it all? Perri Klass and her mother, Sheila Solomon Klass, both gifted professional writers, prove to be ideal co-writers as they examine their decades of motherhood, daughterhood, and the wonderful ways their lives have overlapped  .
Perri notes with amazement how closely her own life has mirrored her mother's: both have full-time careers; both have published books, articles, and stories; each has three children; they both love to read. They also love to travel--in fact, they often take trips together. But in truth, the harder they look at their lives, the more they acknowledge their big differences in circumstance and basic nature.
A child of the Depression  , Sheila was raised in Brooklyn by parents who considered education a _ for girls. Starting with her college education, she has fought for everything she's ever accomplished. Perri, on the other hand, grew up privileged in the New Jersey suburbs of the 1960s and 1970s. For Sheila, wasting time or money is a crime, and luxury is unthinkable while Perri enjoys the occasional small luxury, but has not been successful at trying to persuade her mother into enjoying even the tiniest thing she likes.
Each writing in her own unmistakable voice, Perri and Sheila take turns exploring the joys and pains, the love and bitterness, the minor troubles and lasting respect that have always bonded them together. Sheila describes the adventure of giving birth to Perri in a tiny town in Trinidad where her husband was doing research fieldwork. Perri admits that she can't sort out all the mess in the households, even though she knows it drives her mother crazy. Together they compare thoughts on bringing up children and working, admit long-hidden sorrows, and enjoy precious memories.
Looking deep into the lives they have lived separately and together, Perri and Sheila tell their mother-daughter story with honesty, humor, enthusiasm, and admiration for each other. A written account in two voices, Every Mother Is a Daughter is a duet   that produces a deep, strong sound with the experiences that all mothers and daughters will recognize. 
 Question:How are women's lives explored in this book? 
A. In a musical form. 
B. Through field research. 
C. With unique writing skills. 
D. From different points of view.

Context: Whether it's a carol service or an evening of karaoke in the pub, many people will enjoy a good old singsong this Christmas. Singing aloud will not just lift the spirits---it's good for your physical health as well. Filling the lungs with air, increasing the heart rate and getting blood pumping round the body faster can all help our physical health.
For the past few years Heart Research UK has been Funding a Christmas campaign aimed at getting people singing, simply for the benefit it can bring. The organizer of the campaign says singing is a safe, simple and social activity that everyone can enjoy. ""Singing is linked to long life, stress reduction, and general health protection. It also brings a great amount of happiness. It is impossible to sing well with a long face because it affects your pitch .""
Professor Graham Welch, who leads the International Music Education Research Centre at the University of London, has spent more than 30 years studying the effects of singing. He says that singing is a form of exercise. It means we're also having a strong aerobic activity when we're singing, which results in increasing the feeling of pleasure while decreasing that of stress.
""And communal singing--like in a singing group, a church service or even a singsong in the pub--helps improve our sense of self-respect. It increases our sense of satisfaction with ourselves, a greater sense of feeling included. ""
Helen Astrid, a singing teacher, also sees the great effects that singing brings. ""It lifts us up on a spiritual level, it helps our self-respect, and it's great for all ages from small kids to grannies--you can have a good sing and _ .""
But she warns people not to have too many beers or glasses of wine, though a glass may help them gather courage before taking to the stage during the holidays. 
 Question:Which is the best title of the passage? 
A. Karaoke--Best Place for Singing! 
B. Christmas--Best Time for Singing! 
C. Singing--Healthy but Difficult 
D. For Health--Let's Sing!

Context: Riding was the favourite activity of Thomas Jefferson, who was the third President of the United States. He usually rode good horses.
One day, he was riding outside Washington, when a jockey   came near. He did not know the President, but his professional eye was attracted by Mr. Jefferson's horse. He stopped and said that he wanted to buy the horse, but Mr. Jefferson politely refused his offer.
The jockey offered more money for the horse, because the closer he looked at the horse, the more he liked it. All of his offers were refused, which made him angry. He then became rude, but his rudeness left as little an impression as his money, for Jefferson had a very good temper. At last, he hit Mr. Jefferson's horse with his whip, getting it to run suddenly. This would have thrown a less skillful rider to the ground, but Jefferson stayed on his seat, and controlled his horse well.
The jockey then gave up. He rode with Mr. Jefferson side by side and began to talk with him about politics. Jefferson joined in the conversation. When they got into the city and came close to the gate of the presidential mansion  , Mr. Jefferson stopped, and politely invited the man to enter.
The jockey was surprised and asked, ""Why? Do you live here?""
""Yes"" was the simple reply.
""Why, stranger, what's your name?""
""My name is Thomas Jefferson.""
Embarrassed, the man quickly left, while the President looked at him with a smile and then rode through the gate. 
 Question:We can infer from the passage that   _  . 
A. the jockey had once bought a horse from another stranger 
B. Mr. Jefferson was very good at riding a horse 
C. Mr. Jefferson would invite the jockey to his own house later 
D. the jockey would not talk about this experience to others 
 Answer: B
Context: In my mind, there is a moving story about a skinny young boy who loved football with all his heart.
Practice after practice, he eagerly gave everything he had. But being half the size of the other boys,he got  ly nowhere. Despite his hard training at all the games, this hopeful athlete sat on the bench and hardly ever played.
This teenager lived alone with his father, and the relationship between the two of them was very special. Even though the son was always on the bench, his father was always in the stands cheering. He never missed a game. This young man was still the smallest of the class when he entered high school. But his father continued to encourage him.
The young man loved football and was determined to try his best at every practice, and perhaps he'd get to play when he became a senior. All through high school he never missed a practice nor a game but remained a benchwarmer. Besides, his faithful father was always in the stands, always with words of encouragement for him. When the young man went to college, he decided to try out for the football team as a""walk-on"". Everyone firmly believed that he could never make the cut, but he did.
The news that he had survived the cut thrilled him so much that he rushed to the nearest phone and called his father. His father shared his excitement and was sent season tickets for all the college games. This persistent young athlete never missed practice during his four years at college, butactually he never got the real chance to play in a game.
It was at the end of his senior football season that the coach met him with a telegram. The young man read the telegram and he became totally silent. Swallowing hard, he mumbled to the coach,""My father died this morning. Is it all right if I miss practice today?""The coach put his arm gently around his shoulder and said,""Take the rest of the week off, son. And don't even plan to come back to the game on Saturday.""
Saturday arrived, and the game was not going well. In the third quarter, when the team was ten points behind, a silent young man quietly slipped into the empty locker room and put on his football gear. As he ran onto the sidelines , the coach and his players were surprised to see their faithful teammate back so soon.""Coach, please let me play. I've just got to play today,""said the young man. The coach pretended not to hear him. There was no way he wanted his worst player in this close play-off game. But the young man insisted, and finally feeling sorry for the kid, the coach gave in.""All right,""he said.""You can go in.""Before long, the coach, the players and everyone in the stands could not believe their eyes. This little unknown, who had never played before, was doing everything right. The opposing team could not stop him. He ran, passed, blocked, and tackled like a star. His team began to succeed. The score was soon tied. In the closing seconds of the game, this kid got a pass and ran all the way for the winning touchdown.
Finally, after the stands had emptied, the coach noticed that this young man was sitting quietly in the corner all alone. The coach came to him and said,""Kid, you were unbelievably fantastic! Tell me what got into you? How did you do it?""
He looked at the coach, tears in his eyes, and said,""Well, you knew my dad died, but did you know that my dad was blind?""The young man swallowed hard and forced a smile,""Dad came to all my games, but today was the first time he could see me play, and I wanted to show him I could make it!"" 
 Question:From the passage, we can infer that   . 
A. the young man's coach played an important role in his growth 
B. the young man's father had a great positive influence on him 
C. not until his father passed away did the young man train hard 
D. the young man's road to success in football was always smooth

Context: Undoubtedly there are a few positive characters who are able to ""rise above"" their environment, who are able to impress the people with whom they come in contact in spite of their clothes.
Sometimes we read of some learned woman, who has ""made good in her profession,"" who says that she has not looked in a mirror for years; but such a woman is a rare exception, and one is not safe in gambling  with one's chances of success by following her. It is not the positive characters with whom we are concerned, however, for they are few and somehow manage to take care of themselves. The vast majority of the race are not so blessed, and we need to observe but little to realize that with them the reaction of clothes is an important factor.
School girls should know that clothes may make a career; happiness and leadership in all the years of high school and college life may be affected by the story a Freshman's clothes tell. Many a girl with a keen mind, who has a natural disregard for clothes, perhaps, or who has not been trained in the appreciation of beauty in clothes, has lost her opportunities for leadership and self-expression which by right her brain power should have given her.
One of the mental capacities which we all exercise and yet exercise most unconsciously is that of passing judgment on the people we meet. In a majority of cases the judgment is superficial  and inaccurate; but the estimate is made. Some people may not get their final judgment till they hear one talk and will judge one by the tone of voice and by what is said as the true index; but the vast majority will form an opinion based largely, if not entirely, on appearance. One tells the world daily of one's ideals, ambitions or good breeding through dress; and it is told so plainly that ""he who runs may read"" and, perhaps, he who reads may run. 
 Question:Which of the following can be the best title? 
A. Rise Above Your Environment 
B. He Who Runs May Read 
C. Dress to Impress 
D. Art of Dressing 
 Answer: C

School girls should know that clothes may make a career; happiness and leadership in all the years of high school and college life may be affected by the story a Freshman's clothes tell. Many a girl with a keen mind, who has a natural disregard for clothes, perhaps, or who has not been trained in the appreciation of beauty in clothes, has lost her opportunities for leadership and self-expression which by right her brain power should have given her.
One of the mental capacities which we all exercise and yet exercise most unconsciously is that of passing judgment on the people we meet. In a majority of cases the judgment is superficial  and inaccurate; but the estimate is made. Some people may not get their final judgment till they hear one talk and will judge one by the tone of voice and by what is said as the true index; but the vast majority will form an opinion based largely, if not entirely, on appearance. One tells the world daily of one's ideals, ambitions or good breeding through dress; and it is told so plainly that ""he who runs may read"" and, perhaps, he who reads may run.

Context: Donald was shaken by thunder on the bed before he could count ""one thousand one"". Then he heard the smoke alarm go off. He went downstairs quickly to investigate. When he opened the door to the basement  , flames exploded out.
Donald fled   back upstairs to call 911 but the phone didn't work. When he tried to go downstairs, he was stopped by a wall of flames. He had to use a towel to cover his mouth. His house was three miles off the main road and so well hidden by trees that Donald knew calling for help would be useless. Actually, he didn't even try to do that.
About one mile away lived Donald's closest neighbor, Jeremie. When he heard some sounds, Jeremie jumped out of bed, holding a phone and a flashlight, and went towards the noise.

Context: When Alexandra Holderman of Indiana was five years old, she saw a bay dressed in only a T-shirt, diaper , and blanket in the middle of winter. Alexandra could tell that the baby was very cold. ""He had red, chapped  skin and a runny nose,"" she remembers.
That same year, Alexandra started Baby Bundles  , a program to help mothers keep their babies warm. She packed bundles of pajamas, blankets, diapers, bottles and bibs, and then delivered them to centers for women who couldn't afford the items. Alexandra continues this program today.
Where does Alexandra get the money for her program? The first year, family members helped a lot. Many of them gave Alexandra money to buy supplies. Alexandra's mother, who has always encouraged Alexandra to share her blessings with people who are less fortunate, taught her how to request donations from stores.
Alexandra felt shy speaking with stores' business managers at first. ""But now it just comes naturally,"" she says, ""and I have places that donate stuff every year."" Alexandra has been doing Baby Bundles for six years now. Each September she writes betters to stores asking for supplies and donations. Then she makes follow-up phone calls. In October, she gathers all of the donations and goes shopping. One of the biggest challenges is getting all of the supplies she needs while staying within a planned budget.
     Alexandra has had to give up her allowance and some time with friends, but she knows that what she's doing helps. Sometimes she sees a baby wearing clothes like the ones she put in her bundles. And she wonders if that baby was helped by her program. ""I know that there are babies out there who are warmer and healthier now,"" she says.
Alexandra plans to continue Baby Bundles as long as she can and is currently trying to get a Web site set up. She hopes that her work will inspire other young people to find ways to serve their communities. Alexandra has made sure that many babies in Indiana remain cozy during the winter months.     DCAC 
 Question:The following things except   _   may be included in Alexandra's Baby Bundles.

C. baby caps

Context: The statistics I've cited and the living examples are all too familiar to you. But what may not be so familiar will be the increasing number of women who are looking actively for advancement of for a new job in your offices. This woman may be equipped with professional skills and perhaps valuable experience. She will not be content to be Executive Assistant to Mr. Seldom Seen of the Assistant Vice President's Girl Friday, who is the only one who comes in on Saturday.
She is the symbol of what I call the Second Wave of Feminism. She is the modern woman who is determined to be.
Her forerunner was the radical feminist who interpreted her trapped position as a female as oppression by the master class of men. Men, she believed, had created a domestic, servile role for women in order that men could have the career and the opportunity to participate in making the great decisions of society. Thus the radical feminist held that women through history had been oppressed and dehumanized, mainly because man chose to exploit his wife and the mother of his children. Sometimes it was deliberate exploitation and sometimes it was the innocence of never looking beneath the pretensions of life.
The radical feminists found strength in banding together. Coming to recognize each other for the first time, they could explore their own identities, realize their own power, and view the male and his system as the common enemy. The first phases of feminism in the last five years often took on this militant, class-warfare tone. Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, Germaine Greer, and many others hammered home their ideas with a persistence that aroused and intrigued many of the brightest and most able women in the country. Consciousness-raising groups allowed women to explore both their identities and their dreams--and the two were often found in direct conflict.
What is the stereotyped role of American women? Marriage. A son. Two daughters. Breakfast. Ironing. Lunch. Bowling, maybe a garden club of for the very daring, non-credit courses in ceramics. Perhaps an occasional cocktail party. Dinner. Football or baseball on TV. Each day the same. Never any growth in expectations--unless it is growth because the husband has succeeded. The inevitable question: ""Is that all there is to life?""
The rapid growth of many feminist organizations attests to the fact that these radical feminists had touched some vital nerves. The magazine ""Ms."" was born in the year of the death of the magazine ""Life."" But too often the consciousness-raising sessions became ends in themselves. Too often sexism reversed itself and man-hating was encouraged. Many had been with the male chauvinist.
It is not difficult, therefore, to detect a trend toward moderation. Consciousness-raising increasingly is regarded as a means to independence and fulfillment, rather than a ceremony of fulfillment itself. Genuine independence can be realized through competence, through finding a career, through the use of education. Remember that for many decades the education of women was not supposed to be useful. 
 Question:What does the word ""militant"" mean? 
A. Aggressive. 
B. Ambitions. 
C. Progressive. 
D. Independent. 
 Answer: A
Context: Sex prejudices are based on and justified by the ideology  that biology is destiny. According to this ideology, basic biological and psychological differences exist between the sexes. These differences require each sex to play a separate role in social life. Women are the weaker sex both physically and emotionally. Thus, they are naturally suited, much more so than men, to the performance of domestic  duties. A woman's place, under normal circumstances, is within the protective environment of the home. Nature has determined that women play caretaker roles, such as wife and mother and homemaker. On the other hand, men are best suited to go out into the competitive world of work and politics, where serious responsibilities must be taken on. Men are to be the providers; women and children are ""dependents"".
The ideology also holds that women who wish to work outside the household should naturally fill these jobs that are in line with the special capabilities of their sex. It is appropriate for women, not men, to be employed as nurses, social workers, elementary school teachers, house-hold helpers, clerks and secretaries. These positions are simply an extension of women's domestic role. Informal distinctions between ""women's work"" and ""men's work"" in the labor force, according to the ideology, are simply a functional reflection of the basic differences between the sexes.
Finally, the ideology suggests that nature has worked her will in another significant way. For the human species to survive over time, its members must regularly reproduce. Thus, women must, whether at home or in the labor force, make the most of their physical appearances.
So goes the ideology. It is, of course, not true that basic biological and psychological differences between the sexes require each to play sex-defined roles in social life. There is enough evidence that sex roles vary from society to society, and _ 
But to the degree people actually believe that biology is destiny and that nature intended for men and women to make different contributions to society, sex-defined roles will be seen as totally acceptable. 
 Question:According to the biology-is-destiny ideology, women  _  . 
A. cannot compete with men in any field 
B. are suited more to domestic jobs than men 
C. are sensitive enough to be a good caretaker 
D. are too weak to do any agricultural work at all

Context: Many women write to me perplexed  about why they can't form close friendships.They try new approaches,put themselves in all the right places,see therapists,and read relevant selfhelp books.They consider themselves interesting,loyal,kind,and friendworthy people.But for reasons unknown to them,they have a tough time forming intimate relationships.Many admit to not having even one close friend.
A recent study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology offers some clues as to how both nature(personality) and nurture (experience) impact our friendships.Researchers at the University of Virginia and University of Toronto,Mississauga studied more than 7,000 American adults between the ages of 20 and 75 over a period of ten years,looking at the number of times these adults moved during childhood.Their study,like prior ones,showed a link between residential mobility and adult wellbeing:The more  times participants moved as children,the poorer the quality of their adult social relationships.
But digging deeper,the researchers found that personality--specifically being introverted   or extroverted  --could either intensify or buffer   the effect of moving to a new town or neighborhood during childhood.The negative impact of more moves during childhood was far greater for introverts compared to extroverts.
""Moving a lot makes it difficult for people to maintain longterm close relationships,"" stated Dr.Shigehiro Oishi,the first author of the study,in a press release from the American Psychological Association,""This might not be a serious problem for outgoing people who can make friends quickly and easily.Less outgoing people have a harder time making new friends.""
Families often have to relocate--across town,across the country,or across the globe.Yet,in many cases,their kids and young adolescents haven't yet built up a bank of friendships.So the conventional wisdom is to try to minimize moves for the sake of your child,whenever possible,and to move at the end of the academic year. 
 Question:In order for children to maintain longterm close relationships,parents   _  . 
A. should not relocate their homes 
B. should relocate their homes within the town 
C. had better move at the end of the school year 
D. had better move when their children couldn't build up a bank of friendships 
 Answer: C
Context: Jascha Richter once sang ""don't need too much talking without saying anything"" to reveal his lonely feeling in a crowd.
Dad always told me never to ever reveal my true opinions towards other people if such opinions are negative. He said this is the ""Chu Shi Zhe Xue"", the philosophy of dealing with social network.
It seems that everybody here just follows this philosophy very, very well.
Friends. I would say that if I were given true friendship I would definitely treasure it with my greatest care. If I really regard someone as my close friend, I would never leave her alone whenever she's in need, either financially or mentally. And I always believe, as long as I treat people with whole-hearted honesty, I would have some rewards--at least, just ONE true friend of the same gender .
Sometimes I just miss my friends in China. Perhaps when we became friends, we were still young, too young to have been polluted by any dirt in the society. But here, it is simply different. It seems that all of us have learnt how to SURVIVE in a foreign land and such an experience actually makes us learn how to extract   the most benefits from the surroundings in order to survive.
All are friends around me. I've looked through all the dark sides of their personalities and yet I have to pretend that I know nothing. THEY ARE GOOD. THEY ARE GOOD. AND WE ARE FRIENDS. And then I can make myself comfortable enough to talk to people I hate the most. And of course, they don't say any words truly from their hearts. Neither do I.
But, sometimes I just feel unwilling to talk to these people. Sometimes, I just want to be alone, quietly, without being forced to listen to their gossip or other useless words.
""Standing on a mountain high
Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky
I should go and see some friends
But they don't really comprehend""
Jascha Richter expresses my feelings also.

Context: At the age of sixteen,I joined a volunteer group with my dad. I went on my first volunteer project in West Virginia. On the night we arrived, we discovered that ""our family"" was living in a trailer  that was in poor condition. A crew had been working on it for two weeks,but every time they finished one problem,another surfaced(, ). 
We decided the only reasonable solution was to build a new house--something unusual but necessary under these circumstances. The family was overjoyed with their new house that was twenty by thirty feet with three bedrooms,a bath and a kitchen. 
On Tuesday of that week, while we were eating lunch together,I asked the family's three boys,Josh,Eric and Ryan,""What do you want for your new room?""Expecting toys and other gadgets that children usually ask for, we were astonished when Josh responded,""I just want a bed.""
The boys had never slept in a bed! They were accustomed to plastic mats. That night we had a meeting and decided that beds would be the perfect gift. On Thursday night, a few adults in our group drove to the nearest city and bought beds and new bedding. 
When we saw the delivery truck coming,we told the family about the surprise. We could hardly control ourselves. It was like watching excited children on Christmas morning. 
That afternoon, as we fitted the frames of the beds together, Eric ran into the house to watch us. Too dirty to enter his room,he observed with wideeyed enthusiasm from the doorway. 
As my father slipped a pillowcase  onto one of the pillows,Eric asked,""What is that?""
""A pillow,"" he replied. 
""What do you do with it?"" Eric continued to ask. 
""When you go to sleep,you put your head on it,"" I answered softly. Tears came to my eyes as my father handed Eric the pillow. 
""Oh...that's soft,"" he said,hugging it tightly. 
Now,when my sister or I start to ask for something that seems urgent,my dad gently asks,  ""Doyouhaveapillow?""
We know exactly what he means. 
 Question:From the passage,  we can learn that Eric had never seen  _   before. 
A. a trailer 
B. a truck 
C. a pillow 
D. a house

Context: A TV program was being videoed. Tonight it was to select the sweetest whisper of love ever said between husband and wife.
The final competition was held among 10 married couples. Seven of them were young ones, two middle-aged and one old. The last turn came to the old couple. The old lady took the microphone and said the sweetest whisper of love she had ever heard was: "" Are you standing or sitting?""
The host fixed his eyes on her, quite puzzled by her words.
Regardless of all the talking around, she went on with her story. Her husband had been a doctor before he retired. One day when he was on duty at the hospital, he felt a sharp pain at the heart. By his professional knowledge he knew immediately he suffered a fit of heart attack. His colleagues carried him at once to the operation room and prepared  him for a bypass operation, which was highly risky. The patient's family members had to be informed before it began. The patient himself was allowed to put in a word. Lying silently on the operation table with a trembling hand, he dialed after a moment's thinking of the number of his wife's phone. Finally a familiar voice came from the other end...
""So many years had passed but memory of this incident remained fresh in my mind. What he said in the beginning was: 'Are you standing or sitting?' He was actually worried about me, wondering how I felt at the news. He was afraid I would have fallen flat onto the ground. In such a critical  state as he was then, his thought still went to me..."" The old lady concluded slowly, ""That's the sweetest whisper of love I've ever heard all my life.""
A loud applause followed in the wake of a short silence. 
 Question:which of the following might be the best title for the text? 
A. Are You Standing or Sitting. 
B. True Love Needn't Words. 
C. A Moving TV Program.

Context: When it comes to President Obama, most of his personal business is already known by the public. Personal information about his children, Malia and Sasha, however, has been kept a little more _ .
The New York Timesrecently released a list of rules that Michelle Obama has mentioned over the years that Malia and Sasha must follow during their time in the White House, as well as in general. See how the first family educates their children:
The girls must write reports about what they've seen on their trips, even if it's not required by their school.
Malia may use her cell phone only on the weekends, and she and her sister cannot watch television or use a computer for anything but homework during the week.
Malia and Sasha have to play two sports: one they choose and one selected by their mother.
Malia must learn todo laundry  before she leaves for college.
The girls have to eat their vegetables, and if they say they are not hungry, they cannot ask for cookies or chips later.
While these might be shocking to some, Michelle said, ""They're not little princess. It's just basic rules, boundaries, and expectations that we would have normally.""
Michelle also mentions another set of rules:
The girls must do their chores , though the White House has a large staff. Malia and Sasha have chores of their own.
They must play a team sport, because it's about learning how to play on a team, how to lose and how to win gracefully.
...

Context: Danger-junkie orangutans  in Borneo climb dead trees and shake then until they begin to fall. They scream with excitement as they cling to the falling tree. Just before the tree hits the ground the orangutans leap to another tree or vine, narrowly escaping death. While no one cab ask orangutans if they enjoy it as a person playing an extreme sport, one animal behaviorist sees this monkey fun as a bit of harmless thrill-seeking.
A growing number of scientists agree that animals are conscious and capable of experiencing basic emotions , such as happiness, sadness, boredom or depression. A few scientists even see the possibility for higher animal emotions like love, jealousy and spite.
Five years ago, behaviorist and animal-rights activist Dr. Jonathan Balcombe stood on a Virginia hotel balcony watching two crows intimately groom   each other in the comfort of an abandoned billboard. He felt that the birds liked what they were doing, even if engaged in a natural, beneficial act, such as picking parasites   off the other's feathers. That moment changed the way he would view animals forever and led to a book, ""Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good"", which is filled with hundreds of examples of animals living it up thanks to developed senses of touch, taste, sight, sound and smell.
Balcombe recounts a favorite example of Kenyan hippos   having high-end spa treatment in a fresh water spring. They splay their toes, open their mouths wide and wait for a school of cleaner fish to remove parasites and slough off dead skin, he recalls. Balcombe knows that the hippos and the fish both benefit from this arrangement. ""My interpretation is that it is also enjoyable for them ,"" he says. 
 Question:We can conclude from the passage that   _  . 
A. only a few animals have emotions 
B. Balcombe's theory is not supported by other scientists 
C. Balcombe has watched a lot of animals showing emotions 
D. Balcombe can understand animal language

Context: So the little girl now walked on, her bare feet quite red and blue with the cold. She carried a small bundle of matches in her hand, and a good many more in her tattered dress. No one had bought any of them the live long day; no one had given her a single penny. Trembling with cold and hunger crept she on, the picture of sorrow: poor little child!
The snow-flakes fell on her long, fair hair, which curled in such pretty ringlets over her shoulders; but she thought not of her own beauty, or of the cold. Lights were glimmering through every window, and the savor of roast goose reached her from several houses;it was New Year's eve, and it was of this that she thought.
In a corner formed by two houses, one of which projected beyond the other. She sat down, drawing her little feet close under her, but in vain, she could not warm them. She dared not go home, she had sold no matches, earned not a single penny, and perhaps her father would beat her,besides her home was almost as cold as the street,it was an attic; and although the larger of the many chinks in the roof were stopped up with straw and rags. The wind and snow often penetrated through. Her hands were nearly dead with cold; one little match from her bundle would warm them. Perhaps, if she dared light it, she drew one out, and struck it against the wall, bravo! It was a bright, warm flame, and she held her hands over it. It was quite an illumination for that poor little girl; no, I call it rather a magic taper, _ , so beautifully blazed the fire within! The child stretched out her feet to warm them also; alas, in an instant the flame had died away, the stove disappeared, the little girl sat cold and comfortless, with the burnt match in her hand. 
 Question:Which below is not the reason why the little girl dared not go home? 
A. She earned not a single penny. 
B. Her father would beat her. 
C. Her home was almost as cold as the street. 
D. She didn't finished selling her matches.

When a student from a warm country comes to England in autumn for the first time, he feels cold at first. There are often clouds, grey sky and cold rain in England in autumn, and most students from warm countries do not like this.
But snow is different. It is beautiful. Perhaps, after several mornings, the student wakes up one day, and there is a lot of light in his room. He thinks, ""Is it so late?"" and jumps out of bed. But no, it is not very late. He looks out of the window and there is snow on the ground and on the houses and everywhere. 
 Question:In the   _   of England there is little snow in winter. 
A. east 
B. west 
C. south 
D. north

Context: While success is surely sweeter than failure, it seems failure is a far better teacher, and organizations that fail spectacularly often flourish more in the long run, according to a new study by Vinit Desai, assistant professor of management at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. Researchers have found that people missing their goals perform much better in the long run. That is because they gain more knowledge from their failures than their successes and the lessons are more likely to stay longer in their minds.
""We found that the knowledge gained from success was often fleeting while knowledge from failure stuck around for years,"" said professor Desai, who led the study. ""But companies often ignore failure. Managers may fire people or turn over the whole workforce while they should treat the failure as a learning opportunity.""
Prof Desai compared the flights of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Challenger. During the 2002 Atlantis flight, a piece of insulation   broke off and damaged the left solid rocket booster   but didn't influence the program. There was little investigation. The Challenger was launched next and another piece of insulation broke off. This time the shuttle and its seven-person crew were destroyed. The disaster led to a major investigation resulting in 29 changes to prevent future disasters.
The difference in response in the two cases came down to this: Atlantis was considered a success and the Challenger a failure.
""Despite crowded skies, airlines are extremely reliable,"" he said. ""The number of failures is extremely small. And past researches have shown that older airlines, those with more experience in failure, have a lower number of accidents.""
Prof Desai doesn't recommend finding out failure in order to learn. Instead, he advises organizations to analyze small failures to collect useful information rather than wait for major failures. 
 Question:Fewer accidents happen to older airlines in that   _  . 
A. their planes couldn't fly high in the sky 
B. they gained much from experience in failure 
C. their planes were often checked by the experts 
D. they were unpopular among passengers

Context: One day Marilla said, ""Anne, your new teacher, Miss Stacy, spoke to me yesterday. She says you must study for the examinations for Queen's College in two years' time. Then if you do well, you can study at Queen's in Charlottetown for a year, and after that you'll be a teacher!""
""That doesn't matter, Anne. When Matthew and I adopted you three years ago, we decided to look after you as well as we could. Of course we'll pay for you to study.""So in the afternoons Anne and some of her friends stayed late at school, and Miss Stacy helped them with the special examination work. Diana didn't want to go to Queen's, so she went home early, but Gilbert stayed. He and Anne still never spoke and everybody knew that they were enemies, because they both wanted to be first in the examination. Secretly, Anne was sorry that she and Gilbert weren't friends, but it was too late now.
For two years, Anne studied hard at school. She enjoyed learning, and Miss Stacy was pleased with her. But she didn't study all the time. In the evenings and at weekends she visited her friends, or walked through the fields with Diana, or sat talking to Matthew.
""Your Anne is a big girl now. She's taller than you,"" Rachel Lynde told Marilla one day.
""You're right, Rachel!"" said Marilla in surprise.
""And she's a very good girl now, isn't she? She doesn't get into trouble these days. I'm sure she helps you a lot with the housework, Marilla.""
""Yes, I don't know what I'd do without her,"" said Marilla, smiling.
""And look at her! Those beautiful grey eyes, and that red-brown hair! You know, Marilla, I thought you and Matthew made a mistake when you adopted her. But now I see I was wrong. You've looked after her very well.""
""Well, thank you, Rachel,"" replied Marilla, pleased.
That evening, when Matthew came into the kitchen, he saw that his sister was crying.
""What's the matter?"" he asked, surprised. ""You haven't cried since... well, I can't remember when.""
""It's just... well, I was thinking about Anne,"" said Marilla. ""I'll...I'll miss her when she goes away.""
""When she goes to Queen's, you mean? Yes, but she can come home at weekends, on the train.""
""I'll still miss her,"" said Marilla sadly.""
In June the Avonlea boys and girls had to go to Charlottetown to take their examinations.
""Oh, I do hope that I've done well,"" Anne told Diana when she arrived back at Green Gables. ""The examinations were very difficult. And I've got to wait for three weeks before I know! Three weeks! I'll die!""
Anne wanted to do better than Gilbert. But she also wanted to do well for Matthew and Marilla. That was very important to her.
Diana was the first to hear the news, she ran into the kitchen at Green Gables and shouted, ""Look, Anne! It's in Father's newspaper! You're first... with Gilbert... out of all the students on the island! Oh, how wonderful!"" Anne took the paper with shaking hands, and saw her name, at the top of the list of two hundred. She could not speak.
""Well, now, I knew it,"" said Matthew with a warm smile.
""You've done well, I must say, Anne,"" said Marilla, who was secretly very pleased.
For the next three weeks Anne and Marilla were very busy. Anne needs new dresses to take to Charlottetown. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is true? 
A. To be a teacher was one of Annes' dreams. 
B. Both Anne and Diana studied hard for the special examination. 
C. Matthew and Marilla were Anne's parents.

Context: Linda was kind of late. Linda, 25, had a lot to do at work, plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Linda felt weak and tired -- maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks.
Several yards away, Frank, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying.
But when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, ""Oh, my God, she fell in!""Frank didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. ""No ! Not you ! ""his girlfriend screamed after him.
She was right to be alarmed. By the time Frank reached Linda, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station.
It was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the arms and drag her away from the edge. That was where Linda briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse.
Linda thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in.
Police and fire officials soon arrived, and Frank told the story to an officer. Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40minute train ride downtown--just as he had been seconds after the rescue, which made her think about her reaction at the time. ""I saw the train coming and I was thinking he was going to die, "" she explained. 
 Question:How did Frank save Linda? 
A. By helping her rise to her feet. 
B. By lifting her to the platform. 
C. By pulling her along the ground. 
D. By dragging her away from the edge.

Context: On August 5 at 10:31 p.m. PST, a rover named Curiosity touched down safely on the surface of Mars, and I was lucky enough to have a front-row seat.
My name is Clara, and when I was in Grade 6, I won the essay contest NASA held to name its next Mars rover. The essay I wrote was not even 250 words long, but somehow it was enough to change my life.
I still remember that cold December day, sitting in a science class. I'd finished a worksheet early and decided to get a Time for Kids magazine off Mrs. Estevez's bookshelf. It was the 2008 Invention Issue, but that wasn't the only thing that caught my eye. In the magazine, there was an article about a girl who named the Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity. The article also talked about the essay contest NASA was holding to name its next Mars rover. Before I even knew anything else about it, a single word flooded my 11-year-old mind: Curiosity.
I couldn't wait for the bell to ring so I could get started on my essay. That afternoon, I raced home from the bus stop, sat down at the computer and typed until my fingers ached. It turned out that I was just in time. A few days later, and the contest would have closed.
Five months later, shortly after I had turned 12, I was watching a National Geographic special on mammoths when the phone rang. My mom answered, and immediately, a wide smile spread across her face. When she told me that I had won, I was happier than I could ever remember being, I screamed and ran up and down the stairs and all around the house. I completely forgot about the mammoths and did not even remember to turn off the TV until it was really late.
Curiosity is such an important part of who I am. I have always been fascinated by the stars, the planets, the sky and the universe. I remember as a little girl, my grandfather and I would sit together in the backyard for hours. He'd tell me stories and point out the stars.
My grandfather lived in China, thousands of miles away from my home in Kansas. I loved the stars because they kept us together even when we were apart. They were always there, yet there was so much I didn't know about them. That's what I love so much about space. No matter how much we learn, it will always possess some mystery.
In the past, space exploration may have been a competition to see who got somewhere first or the fastest. But now, it is one of the few things that bring people together. Science is a language that needs no translation. It doesn't matter where you're from or what you look like - you just have to have a thirst for knowledge and a passion for learning in order to succeed.
People often ask me why we go to faraway places like Mars. Why do we explore? My answer to that is simple: because we can; because we're curious; because we as human beings do not just stay holed up in one place. We are constantly wondering and trying to find out what's over the hill and beyond the horizon.
The curiosity rover is more than just a robot. It is more than just a titanium body and aluminum wheels. Curiosity represents the hard work, passion, love and commitment of thousands of people from all over the world who were brought together by science. Science is so awesome. It is breathtaking and mind-blowing; and sometimes, it's just a little bit crazy. The discoveries we make about our world are incredibly humbling. They move us forward and have the potential to benefit all of mankind.
This December it will be four years of my life that have been tied to Curiosity in some way. I've met so many amazing people through this experience, from scientists to engineers to administrators to volunteers. Their devotion and enthusiasm inspire me greatly. My journey with Curiosity and the MSL mission team has shaped the person that I am today, as well as the person I would one day like to become.
I am deeply grateful to everyone who made it possible for me to have this amazing adventure.
And to you, I hope your curiosity takes you far. 
 Question:What is conveyed in the passage? 
A. Curiosity is important to human beings. 
B. A thirst for knowledge helps one grow up. 
C. Entering a contest is a way to achieve success. 
D. Curiosity changes people's attitude towards science.

Context: Kiss crisis, hug horrors and the UK's handshake headaches
Greeting someone, saying goodbye - these situations fill me with unease. You have a second to make a dangerous decision. One peck  ? Two pecks? Three? No kisses at all? Why, I think, as I crash into the other person's face, why can't it be as simple as a handshake?
A survey by the soap company Radox in May showed one in five Brits now feels a handshake is ""too formal"", according to the Daily Mail. Some 42 percent said they never shook hands when greeting friends. For one third of people the alternative was a hug, for 16 percent a kiss on the cheek.
British people are known to be reserved   - unfriendly, some would say. Handshakes used to work for us because we didn't have to get too close. But the super-British handshake is no longer fashionable. We want to be more like our easygoing Mediterranean neighbors who greet each other with kisses and hugs.
The trouble is, we still find it a bit awkward. What does a married man do when greeting a married female friend, for example? How should someone younger greet someone older?
Guys don't tend to kiss one another; my male friends in Britain go for the ""manly hug"", taking each other stiffly   in one arm and giving a few thumps on the back with words like ""Take it easy, yeah?"".
The biggest questions, if you do decide to kiss, are how many times and which cheek first. Unlike the French, who comfortably deliver three, our cheek-pecks usually end in embarrassed giggling  : ""Oh, gosh, sorry, I didn't mean to kiss you on the lips, I never know where to aim for first!""
But then it's never been easy for us poor, uncomfortable Brits. Even the handshake had its problems: don't shake too hard, but don't hold the other person's hand too limply   either, and definitely don't go in with sweaty hands.
Maybe it's better to leave it at a smile and a nod. 
 Question:What is the article mainly about? 
A. Origin of the traditional British way of greeting someone. 
B. New trends and problems that Brits have with the way they greet people. 
C. Why the author feels uneasy when greeting someone or saying goodbye. 
D. Differences in greetings between Britain and other Western countries.

Context: ""Mom, you should put some of your things away. The house should be safe for the baby,"" said my son Mark as he walked upstairs with his wife and fifteen-month-old Hannah.
They visited us for the Thanksgiving holiday. After driving all day from Salt Lake to Ft. Collins, his temper showed. ""That one finger rule may work with other kids, but never Hannah,"" he insisted.
When my three granddaughters first moved into our house three years ago, my friend offered me her secret to behave grandchildren. ""Teach them the 'one finger rule'."" All of her five grandchildren learned it at a young age and it proved to also work well with mine. 
I picked up my granddaughter and said, ""Well, Mark, just watch."" I hugged her and walked all around the great room.
""Hannah, you may touch anything in this room you want, but, you can only use one finger."" I showed the technique by touching my forefinger to the sculpture. Hannah followed my example. ""Good girl. Now what else would you like to touch?""
She stretched her finger toward the lamp. I allowed her to touch everything in sight, plants, glass objects, TV, VCR, speakers, etc. If she started to grab , I gently reminded her to use one finger. She always obeyed. However, Hannah, an only child, possessed a more adventurous personality. Her father predicted it would prevent her from accepting the ""one finger rule"".
During their four-day stay, we aided Hannah in remembering ""one finger rule"". She learned quickly. 
Months later, my husband and I drove to Salt Lake. I watched Mark continue to practice the one finger rule. I smiled happily each time he asked Hannah to touch with ""one finger"".

A. 3.

Then a smile crept  across Sophia's face. ""What great news!"" she responded.

""If I struggle to be an author, then what will we live on? Where will the money come from?""

Context: While success is surely sweeter than failure, it seems failure is a far better teacher, and organizations that fail spectacularly often flourish more in the long run, according to a new study by Vinit Desai, assistant professor of management at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. Researchers have found that people missing their goals perform much better in the long run. That is because they gain more knowledge from their failures than their successes and the lessons are more likely to stay longer in their minds.
""We found that the knowledge gained from success was often fleeting while knowledge from failure stuck around for years,"" said professor Desai, who led the study. ""But companies often ignore failure. Managers may fire people or turn over the whole workforce while they should treat the failure as a learning opportunity.""
Prof Desai compared the flights of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Challenger. During the 2002 Atlantis flight, a piece of insulation   broke off and damaged the left solid rocket booster   but didn't influence the program. There was little investigation. The Challenger was launched next and another piece of insulation broke off. This time the shuttle and its seven-person crew were destroyed. The disaster led to a major investigation resulting in 29 changes to prevent future disasters.
The difference in response in the two cases came down to this: Atlantis was considered a success and the Challenger a failure.
""Despite crowded skies, airlines are extremely reliable,"" he said. ""The number of failures is extremely small. And past researches have shown that older airlines, those with more experience in failure, have a lower number of accidents.""
Prof Desai doesn't recommend finding out failure in order to learn. Instead, he advises organizations to analyze small failures to collect useful information rather than wait for major failures. 
 Question:Fewer accidents happen to older airlines in that   _  . 
A. their planes couldn't fly high in the sky 
B. they gained much from experience in failure 
C. their planes were often checked by the experts 
D. they were unpopular among passengers

Context: ""Tear' em apart!"" ""Kill the fool!"" ""Murder the referee  !""
These are common remarks one may hear at various sporting events. At the time they are made, they may seem innocent enough. But let's not kid ourselves. They have been known to influence behavior in such a way as to lead to real bloodshed. Volumes have been written about the way words affect us. It has been shown that words having certain connotations   may cause us to react in ways quite foreign to what we consider to be our usual humanistic behavior. I see the term ""opponent"" as one of those words. Perhaps the time has come to delete it from sports terms.
The dictionary meaning of the term ""opponent"" is ""adversary"" ""enemy""; ""one who opposes your interests."" Thus, when a player meets an opponent, he or she may tend to treat that opponent as an enemy. At such times, winning may dominate one's intellect, and every action, no matter how gross, may be considered justifiable. I recall an incident in a handball game when a referee refused a player's request for a time out for a glove change because he did not consider them wet enough. The player proceeded to rub his gloves across his wet T-shirt and then exclaimed. ""Are they wet enough now?""
In the heat of battle, players have been observed to throw themselves across the court without considering the consequences that such a move might have on anyone in their way. I have also witnessed a player reacting to his opponent's international and illegal blocking by deliberately hitting him with the ball as hard as he could during the course of play. Off the court, they are good friends. Does that make any sense? It certainly gives proof of a court attitude which departs from normal behavior.
Therefore, I believe it is time we elevated   the game to the level where it belongs there by setting an example to the rest of the sporting world. Replacing the term ""opponent"" with ""associate"" could be an ideal way to start.
The dictionary meaning of the term ""associate"" is ""colleague""; ""friend""; ""companion."" Reflect a moment! You may soon see and possibly feel the difference in your reaction to the term ""associate"" rather than ""opponent."" 
 Question:According to the passage, players, in a game, may   _  . 
A. deliberately throw the ball at anyone illegally blocking their way 
B. keep on screaming and shouting throughout the game 
C. lie down on the ground as an act of protest 
D. kick the ball across the court with force

These are common remarks one may hear at various sporting events. At the time they are made, they may seem innocent enough. But let's not kid ourselves. They have been known to influence behavior in such a way as to lead to real bloodshed. Volumes have been written about the way words affect us. It has been shown that words having certain connotations   may cause us to react in ways quite foreign to what we consider to be our usual humanistic behavior. I see the term ""opponent"" as one of those words. Perhaps the time has come to delete it from sports terms.
The dictionary meaning of the term ""opponent"" is ""adversary"" ""enemy""; ""one who opposes your interests."" Thus, when a player meets an opponent, he or she may tend to treat that opponent as an enemy. At such times, winning may dominate one's intellect, and every action, no matter how gross, may be considered justifiable. I recall an incident in a handball game when a referee refused a player's request for a time out for a glove change because he did not consider them wet enough. The player proceeded to rub his gloves across his wet T-shirt and then exclaimed. ""Are they wet enough now?""
In the heat of battle, players have been observed to throw themselves across the court without considering the consequences that such a move might have on anyone in their way. I have also witnessed a player reacting to his opponent's international and illegal blocking by deliberately hitting him with the ball as hard as he could during the course of play. Off the court, they are good friends. Does that make any sense? It certainly gives proof of a court attitude which departs from normal behavior.
Therefore, I believe it is time we elevated   the game to the level where it belongs there by setting an example to the rest of the sporting world. Replacing the term ""opponent"" with ""associate"" could be an ideal way to start.
The dictionary meaning of the term ""associate"" is ""colleague""; ""friend""; ""companion."" Reflect a moment! You may soon see and possibly feel the difference in your reaction to the term ""associate"" rather than ""opponent.""

Context: Apologizing is both an Art and a Science. The Art lies in the manner in which the apology is delivered while the Science is the recipe that forms the apology itself. A proper apology should always include several ingredients. Now let's take a closer look at these ingredients.
Give a detailed account of the offense, and make sure both you and the other person are talking about the same thing. Whether you make it in secret or public doesn't matter, but your apology should be focused on the particular event.
Next, by acknowledging the hurt or damage done, you are making the recipient   begin to sense that you understand the situation. It is important to rebuild your relationship because it makes them feel their anger is understandable.
Don't try to defend yourself by offering any excuses, which is important to let them know that you understand the event and you actions do cause them harm. The apology is all about THEM and how they feel. It doesn't matter if the actions were intentional or not, the end result is the same and that is what needs to be focused on when learning how to say, ""I'm sorry"".
Give a sincere statement of regret such as ""I apologize"" or ""I'm sorry"". Above all, tell them it won't happen again. After all, there is no value in apologizing for something that you will do again and again.
Finally, asking for forgiveness at the end of the apology gives the power back to the recipient. It tells them, that you have done all that you can do by apologizing and providing whatever form of restitution you can. The next move is up to them.
By including all these ingredients and applying them to your situation, you will know exactly how to say ""I'm sorry"" next time you need to.

Context: People often view the ""last"" moments of an event positively simply because they signal the end of an experience, say experts.
University of Michigan researchers found that even if an experience is painful or negative, but ends on a good note, people will consider it to be positive.
""Endings are powerful,"" said Ed O'Brien, a graduate student in the Department of Psychology at the University of Michigan.
O'Brien and colleague Phoebe Ellsworth, the Frank Murphy Distinguished Professor of Law and Psychology, conducted a chocolate tasting experiment with 52 college students to test the theory.
Volunteers could taste five different Hershey's Kisses chocolates--milk, dark, cream, caramel and almond - but did not know in advance how many pieces they would eat or the type. Participants rated how much they enjoyed the chocolate and described each flavor so that the researchers could record the order in which the randomly   selected treats were eaten.
Volunteers were assigned to the ""next"" or the ""last "" condition by chance.
In the ""next"" condition, the experimenter said ""Here is your next chocolate"" before offering each chocolate, including the fifth.
For the ""last"" condition, the experimenter said ""Here is your last chocolate"" before offering  the fifth chocolate.
These participants rated the fifth chocolate more enjoyable than volunteers in the ""next"" condition.
As predicted, participants who knew they were eating the final chocolate of a taste test enjoyed it more.
In fact, when asked to pick their favorite chocolate, the majority of ""last"" participants chose the fifth - even though the flavor of the fifth was randomly chosen.
They also rated the overall experience as more enjoyable than volunteers who thought they were just eating one more chocolate in a series.
O'Brien says these findings may have far-reaching implications. For example, the last book or film in a series or the last speaker in a symposium   may receive _ praise.
The last job applicant, meanwhile, may look more qualified.

Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""
It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on. 
 Question:That man called after reading about what Jordan did to a disabled child because he wanted to   _  . 
A. become famous himself 
B. know why Jordan appeared in a poor area 
C. let the author know that Jordan was not that nice 
D. offer another example to show that Jordan was a nice man

    During the night it is quite usual for him to stop two or three times for some refreshments  . He said. ""I never drink when I'm working ---- I would lose my licence .""
    He normally goes home between 2 and 3 O'clock in the night, There are times he has to stay longer and try to make more runs. He said, ""That's the worst thing about working for yourself. If you don't make the money , no one is going to give it to you."" 
    London taxi drivers not only 'take' but also 'give' , Every summer hundreds of children from London will go for a day at the sea--- by taxi! Their rides are paid by the taxi drivers, and these fares  all go to the 'London Taxi Fund for Underprivileged Children.' At the sea. they are met by the mayor, and a lunch party is also held in honour of the taxi drivers and the children. After a happy day running around the sea beaches and visiting the market, the children go home again-- by taxi, and free of charge, of course!

Context: Many people travel to different places in the world by air. Usually it takes a long time, perhaps half a day, for passengers to stay in the plan. So airlines offer passengers food. But it is common that they feel bad about food taste. Do you agree?
To solve this problem, airlines try hard to improve their food. They would like to do so because they don't want to lose customers.
However, according to scientific research, part of the reason why plane food tastes bad is that at high altitude we can not taste things as well as we do on the ground. Also scientists have found that our noses become very dry even before a plane takes off. As the plane moves up, the change in air  pressure reduces one third of the sensibility of our taste buds . So our taste buds become senseless. The sad face, however, is that our noses don't know it.
All of these help explain why food on the plane tastes so bad. They also help explain why airlines choose to offer passengers salty and spicy food. Without doing so, the food would be tasteless.
Now there are many researches on this. According to one of them, some volunteers are asked to lie with their feet higher than their heads for weeks. And scientists write down their feelings about food taste.
Though scientists try their best, it is not as easy as they thought. Because they can't deal with the special environment successfully, such as the change in air pressure, making food taste good is still hard for them. 
 Question:What do airlines do to solve this problem? 
A. Get more customers. 
B. Offer more food. 
C. Improve their food. 
D. Reduce the ticket price. 
 Answer: C
Context: Once Dr. Mellinkoff invited me to join him at the hospital to discuss interesting cases(, ) with his  students.The case at hand was a Guatemalan man, aged 34, who had a fever and many other medical problems.His condition was not improving, and there was not much hope he would live.
Dr.: Mellinkoff asked to see the patient.He introduced himself in Spanish and, in a very gentle voice, asked how he felt.The patient smiled and said everything was all right.Then the doctor asked if he was able to eat.The patient said that he had no desire to eat.
""Are you getting food you like?""
The patient said nothing.
""Do you get the kind of food you have at home?""
The answer was no.
The doctor put his hand on the man's shoulder and his voice was very soft.
""If you had food that you liked, would you eat it?""
""Yes, yes,"" the patient said.
The change in the patient's appearance couldn't have been more obvious.Nothing was said, but it was easy to tell that a message had been sent and had also been received.
Later, the doctor asked why the Guatemalan man wasn't getting food he could eat.One of the students said, ""We all know how difficult it is to get the kitchen to make special meals.""
""Suppose,"" the doctor replied, ""you felt a certain medicine was absolutely necessary but that our hospital didn't carry it, would you accept defeat or would you insist the hospital meet your request?""
""I would probably insist,"" the student said.
""Very well,"" the doctor said.""You might want to try the same method in the kitchen.It won't be-easy, but I can help you.Meanwhile, let's get some food inside this man as fast as possible, and stay with it.Or he'll be killed by hunger.By the way, there must be someone among you who can speak Spanish.If we want to make real progress, we need to be able to talk with him.""
Three weeks later.Doctor Mellinkoff told me that the Guatemalan man had left the hospital under his own power.It takes more than medicine to help sick people; you also have to talk to them and make them comfortable. 
 Question:The patient had no desire to eat because   _  . 
A. he was not hungry 
B. he was seriously ill 
C. he was given special meals 
D. he was not satisfied with the food

Context: Back in the old days, when I was a child, we sat around the family roundtable at dinnertime and exchanged our daily experiences. It wasn't very organized, but everyone was recognized and all the news that had to be told was told by each family member.
We listened to each other and the interest was not put-on; it was real. Our family was a unit and we supported each other, and nurtured each other, and liked each other, and--we were even willing to admit--we loved each other.
Today, the family roundtable has moved to the local fast-food restaurant and talk is not easy, much less encouraged.
Grandma, who used to live upstairs, is now. the voice on long distance, and the working parent is far too beaten down each day to spend evening relaxation time listening to the sandbox experience of an eager four-year-old.
So family conversation is as extinct as my old toys and parental questions such as ""What have you been doing, Bobby?"" have been replaced by ""I'm busy, go watch television. ""
And watch TV they do; count them by the millions.
But it's usually not children's television that children watch. Saturday morning, the children's hour, amounts to only about 8 percent of their weekly viewing.
Where are they to be found? Watching adult television, of course, from the Match Game in the morning, to the afternoon at General Hospital, from the muggings and battles on the evening news right through the family hour and past into Starsky and Hutch. That's where you find our kids, over five million of them, at 10 p. m. , not fewer than a million until after midnight! All of this is done with parental permission.
Television, used well, can provide enriching experiences for our young people, but we must use it with some sense. When the carpet is clean, we turn off the vacuum cleaner. When the dishes are clean, the dishwasher turns itself off.
Not so the television, which is on from the sun in the morning to the moon at night and beyond!
Parents must exercise some control and show some concern about the cultural influence on the child when a program not intended for that child is viewed. Parents need to intervene  . Nonintervention may be a wise policy in international affairs, but the results of parental nonintervention will not be wise at all. 
 Question:The working parent is not willing to listen to her (his) four-year-old child talking about his sandbox games because   _  . 
A. she (he) is boring 
B. she (he) is busy 
C. she (he) is very tired 
D. she (he) is angry

Context: The idea of not having a phone at ail could be beneficial sounds crazy to people who are addicted to the global Internet or even just Facebook.
Indeed, it sounds like a pain. But some luxuries of a phone-free lifestyle make us realize that freedom has long been absent from our lives with a phone.
According to The Wall Street Journal's Anton Troianovski. people expect less of you when you don't have a cell phone. Melissa Hildebrand, for example, doesn't even own n phone. She just leaves if her friends don't turn up on time for an event or meeting. ""She gives them 15 to 30 minutes to show up,"" writes Troianovski. With a cell phone in hand, one receives apology calls, which will lengthen the waiting. Without a phone, that responsibility seems to reduce. 
Dean Obeidallah of CNN believes that not having a cell phone gives him the ability to see things; A beautiful woman burning past while fixing her makeup; Asian tourists busy taking photos; a businessman talking on his phone and looking important. ""Instead of texting or checking my e-mail, I began to actually, look at the people I sharing the streets with. It is truly like a movie set filled with extras  from all walks of life, Obeidallah said.
Along with these small benefits of not having a phone, however, come all its inconvenience.
Nancy Kadlick told The Wall Street Journal that she once missed an airport pick-up due to not having a phone.
For Rebecca Greenfield, a columnist for the Atlantic Wire, the inconvenience of not having a phone outweigh(;) these small luxuries. But she also said: ""Not having one every once in a while sounds like a nice practice."" 
 Question:According to Dean Obeidallah, not having a phone can help him_. 
A. enjoy the surroundings 
B. communicate with people on the street 
C. watch more movies sets 
D. explore all walks of life
