Context: A teaching assistant or teacher's aide (TA) or education assistant (EA) is an individual who assists a teacher with instructional responsibilities. TAs include: graduate teaching assistants (GTAs), who are graduate students; undergraduate teaching assistants (UTAs), who are undergraduate students; secondary school TAs, who are either high school students or adults; and elementary school TAs, who are adults (also known as paraprofessional educators or teacher's aides). By definition, TAs assist with classes, but many graduate students serve as the sole instructor for one or more classes each semester as a teaching fellow or graduate student instructor. Graduate and adult TAs generally have a fixed salary determined by each contract period (usually a semester or an academic year); however, undergraduates and high school students are sometimes unpaid and, in the US and other countries with the credit system, receive course credits in return for their assistance. Teaching assistants often help the main teacher by managing students with learning disabilities, such as ADHD, Autism, or even physical disabilities, such as blindness or deafness.

Context: E3 2011 trailer of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception showed Elena helping Drake and Sully again. It also revealed she's now wearing a ring on her left ring finger. During the game it is revealed that she and Drake were married, and later broke up in between the events of Uncharted 2 and 3, due to what we can only believe was to keep Elena safe. Since the events Uncharted 2, Elena has become an international news correspondent, and has been stationed in Yemen for some time. Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan discover that Sir Francis Drake made a stop in Yemen on his quest to find the Atlantis of the Sands. Since the two needed to get into Yemen quietly and without opposition, Sullivan called Elena to ask for her help, as Drake was reluctant to speak to her. When Drake and Sullivan arrive in Yemen, Elena gives them permits and talks to them happily as they exit the airport. But Drake and Elena begin to argue over their sudden arrival and over Elena's wedding band. Nate is more interested by the fact that she is still wearing her wedding ring from their estranged marriage. She claims 'it helps in this part of the world' and tells him not to flatter himself. Nate just smiles, knowing she's not being entirely honest with him. But Elena suspects that Nate is not being honest with her, and is worried about his obsession with Sir Francis Drake's expedition. She also voices her concern about Sullivan, and that Nate shouldn't make him run across the globe for him. Elena takes Drake and Sullivan on a walking tour through Yemen, with the Old Quarter as their targeted destination. In order to dodge the city's guards, the trio climb up to the roof tops. From there, Sullivan spots Talbot walking through the town. Drake pursues him, and is eventually cornered by Marlowe's guards. Once Nate defeats the guards, Elena leads Sullivan and Drake into a courtyard. Coincidentally, the courtyard contains a well that contains the coordinates to Iram. While in the catacombs, the three discover a hidden chamber with messages written on the walls, warning about the dangers of Iram and the desert. Nate deduces that these messages were written by Sir Francis Drake. Elena asks Nate to stop looking for Iram.

Context: In most countries, grade retention has been banned or strongly discouraged. In the United States, grade retention can be used in kindergarten through twelfth grade, however, students in grades seven through twelve are usually only retained in the specific failed subject due to each subject having its own specific classroom rather than staying in one classroom with all subjects taught for the entire school day as it is in grades kindergarten through sixth grade. For example, in grades seven through twelve, a student can be promoted in a math class but retained in a language class. Single classroom grades kindergarten through sixth grade are confined to one room for the whole day, being taught all subjects in the same classroom usually by one teacher with the exception of art and gymnastics conducted in the art room and the gymnasium respectively. In these grades the student must generally fail or score well below the accepted level in most or all areas within the entire curriculum to be retained. The student will then again repeat the entire school year within a single classroom and repeating the same subject matter as the previous year.

Context: The peace treaty left the United States independent and at peace but with an unsettled governmental structure. The Articles envisioned a permanent confederation, but granted to the Congress--the only federal institution--little power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced. There was no president, no executive agencies, no judiciary and no tax base. The absence of a tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states, which seldom arrived. Although historians generally agree that the Articles were too weak to hold the fast-growing nation together, they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue, as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control. 
 Question:were the articles of confederation effective in binding the states together 
 Answer: False

Context: In late 1983, two weeks before signing with EMI, Slovak and Irons obtained a record deal with MCA Records with their other band, What Is This?, and left Red Hot Chili Peppers. Rather than dissolving the band, Kiedis and Flea decided to recruit new members. Cliff Martinez was hired as the band's new drummer and Martinez's bandmate in The Weirdos, guitarist, Dix Denney was expected to replace Slovak. After a few rehearsals, however, the band felt he didn't fit and auditions continued. Their final candidates were guitarists Mark Nine and Jack Sherman, about whom the band knew nothing. After practicing with Sherman, they felt that he was the best fit because he worked well with Flea and Martinez. With Martinez and Sherman aboard, the band released their eponymous debut album on August 10, 1984. During the ensuing tour, continuing musical and lifestyle tension between Kiedis and Sherman complicated the transition between concert and daily band life. Sherman was fired soon after, with Slovak returning to the Chili Peppers in 1985 after growing tired of What Is This?. At one point, Chuck Biscuits filled in on drums during the 1985 tour. The band dismissed Cliff Martinez from the group in April 1986 due to personal differences and replaced him with founding member Jack Irons, who was out of work and finally separated from other commitments. During this period, however, Kiedis and Slovak had both developed serious drug addictions, which resulted in Kiedis being briefly fired that same year. At one performance, longtime friend and then Circle Jerks frontman, Keith Morris filled in for an absent Kiedis who was out scoring drugs while his band was playing a show. On June 25, 1988, Slovak died of a heroin overdose shortly after the completion of The Uplift Mofo Party Plan tour. Kiedis would then retreat into hiding, further fueling his drug habit and even skipping Slovak's funeral. After a band meeting with manager Lindy Goetz, Irons subsequently left the group, saying that he did not want to be part of a band where his friends were dying.

(It later turns out to be a bluff. The dog is still alive.) Oliver physically attacks Barbara, who flees into the attic. Oliver boards up the house to prevent Barbara from escaping so he can kill her, while Barbara loosens the chandelier to drop on Oliver to kill him.

By the time Gavin arrives, Oliver and Barbara's quarrel has culminated in the two hanging dangerously from the insecure chandelier. During this time, Oliver admits to Barbara that despite their hardships, he always loved her, but Barbara does not respond. Before Gavin can come inside with a ladder, the chandelier's support cable snaps and sends them crashing violently to the floor. In his final breaths, Oliver reaches out to touch Barbara's shoulder, but Barbara uses her last ounce of strength to knock his hand away, firmly asserting her feelings for him even in death.

Context: In the season's (and series') final episode, Erica delivers Monica's and Chandler's baby, although, to their surprise, she had twins, a boy and a girl. Phoebe and Ross go to the airport to try to convince Rachel to stay, but they end up going to the wrong airport. After Phoebe causes a delay in the departure, they meet Rachel at the gate before she boards, but even though Ross tells her how he feels, Rachel still boards. Ross goes back home only to find a message from Rachel saying she made a mistake. As she is hindered by a stewardess from getting off the plane, the connection breaks. Ross frantically tries to fix the machine, wondering if she got off the plane. Rachel enters Ross' apartment and says ``I got off the plane''. They kiss and declare their love for each other. The last scene of the series is everyone putting their keys on the table in Monica's apartment. When Rachel asks if they want to go for one last coffee, Chandler replies with the last sarcastic word of the show, ``Where?''. The camera then pans across the empty apartment, before landing on the door. The show then fades to black. The tag scene pans around New York.

Context: A 'light' symmetrical wing-clip will allow a bird to fly down and land safely while indoors. However such a clip may not prevent the bird from flying when outdoors, since lift is generated in proportion to wind speed. Many escaped birds which are recovered are found to have been clipped. So, while a light clip allows downward flight indoors, it does not prevent a bird gaining lift if it should escape outdoors. Conversely, a more severe clip will certainly render a bird flightless, but it increases the risk of injury if the bird falls and hits a hard surface. In addition to the physical effects of wing-clipping, there can be adverse behavioural effects. Birds use flight as an instinctive reflex action and as their first means of escaping any threat: they take to the air to fly upwards and away from the source of the threat; their fear then dissipates. Where this behaviour is prevented by wing-clipping, this innate reflex action is denied the bird, and its fear will not subside. This may cause behavioural problems for the afflicted bird. When a bird needs to reduce its speed during flight, it employs a 'reverse thrust' action by extending its wing at the wrist joint and using the drag of its primaries as air brakes. While the reduced function of the clipped bird's primaries prevent propulsion and therefore lift, this also reduces braking abilities, so clipped birds may crash-land at higher speeds than full-winged birds. Clipped birds should not be taken outdoors unrestrained, as even clipped birds have been known to fly away when spooked outdoors. 
 Question:can birds fly if their wings are clipped

Context: While the kids are away at college, Oliver eventually calms down and attempts to make peace with Barbara over an elegant dinner, but finally reaches his breaking point when Barbara serves him a paté which she implies was made from his dog. (It later turns out to be a bluff. The dog is still alive.) Oliver physically attacks Barbara, who flees into the attic. Oliver boards up the house to prevent Barbara from escaping so he can kill her, while Barbara loosens the chandelier to drop on Oliver to kill him. When their housekeeper Susan pays them an unexpected visit during the night, she senses something is terribly wrong and discreetly contacts Gavin for help. By the time Gavin arrives, Oliver and Barbara's quarrel has culminated in the two hanging dangerously from the insecure chandelier. During this time, Oliver admits to Barbara that despite their hardships, he always loved her, but Barbara does not respond. Before Gavin can come inside with a ladder, the chandelier's support cable snaps and sends them crashing violently to the floor. In his final breaths, Oliver reaches out to touch Barbara's shoulder, but Barbara uses her last ounce of strength to knock his hand away, firmly asserting her feelings for him even in death.

McVay III (July 30, 1898 -- November 6, 1968) was an American naval officer and the commanding officer of USS Indianapolis (CA-35) when it was lost in action in 1945, resulting in a massive loss of life. Of all captains in the history of the United States Navy, he is the only one to have been subjected to court-martial for losing a ship sunk by an act of war, despite the fact that he was on a top secret mission maintaining radio silence (the testimony of the Japanese commander who sank his ship also seemed to exonerate McVay). After years of mental health problems, he committed suicide. Following years of efforts by some survivors and others to clear his name, McVay was posthumously exonerated by the 106th United States Congress and President Bill Clinton on October 30, 2000.

Context: Melody Brooks is an eleven-year-old girl who was born with Cerebral Palsy. Her parents have done everything they can to help her live a normal life, but life is often frustrating for Melody since she cannot speak, move, or communicate her wishes. As a result, Melody has to fight to get her wishes. At age five, Melody is even diagnosed as profoundly retarded. Despite this, Melody's mom enrolls her in Spaulding Street Elementary school to get the education she needs. However, the class she is put in is like a baby class, learning the same things every day. Melody is frustrated by this. Her neighbor, Mrs. V., is a kind, but tough woman. She pushes Melody to do the best she can. When Melody was three, Mrs. V. wasn't impressed for Melody to rely on her parents for everything. Because of this, Mrs. V. forced her to learn how to crawl and roll on the ground. She even taught Melody how to catch herself whenever she fell from her wheelchair. These things helped Melody become self-sufficient, but she continues to be reliant on her parents to help feed her and help her go to the bathroom. When Melody turns eight, her mother becomes pregnant. During this time, Melody overhears them talking about the new baby and their fears that it will suffer the same disabilities. Melody feels ashamed when she hears this. However, Melody is happy when the baby, Penny, is born perfectly healthy. Melody feels jealous as Penny grows and matures since she'll never be able to do the things Penny can do. However, Melody loves her little sister, and the pleasures Melody brings to her parents. When Melody enters fifth grade, she gets a communication device that allows her to talk with other people. At school, her new teacher starts an inclusion program that allows the special needs students to participate in the standard classes. Melody also gets an aide, Catherine, to help her. Melody befriends Rose Spencer, but is bullied by Molly and Claire, who believe that Melody's disability makes her dumber than them. Even her teacher, Mr. Dimming, believes that Melody cannot participate, but is surprised that not only does Melody join, but passes a test exam of a trivia competition with a perfect score. When he tells his class that if Melody can ace it, he is giving way too easy questions, Melody works with Ms. V in order to win the real tryouts, which she does so with a perfect score. Melody then helps the team win the qualifying competition to earn a trip to Washington D.C. for the national competition. However, on the day the group is to fly to Washington, Melody learns that her flight has been canceled due to weather, but that the rest of the team has made an earlier flight without her. Melody insists the day after the fiasco on going to school, but her mom's dismal attitude causes her to accidentally run over Penny despite Melody's attempts to warn her mother. Melody blames herself for not being able to inform her mom, even though everyone, especially Mrs. V., tells her it's not her fault. Although Melody is terrified that Penny will have a brain injury like her and be like her, she learns that Penny is going to be okay, and just has a cast on her leg. On Monday, Melody's class also apologizes for their lack of being considerate towards her by giving her their ninth place trophy, hoping to reconcile with her. However, Melody just's laughs at them and destroys the trophy by accident and says ``no you take it'' and heads out of the room. The next day, she and Catherine begin work on Melody's autobiography, which begins with the first few lines of the book.

Context: Though usually considered joke prizes, traders legally win the Zonks. However, after the taping of the show, any trader who had been Zonked is offered a consolation prize (currently $100) instead of having to take home the actual Zonk. This is partly because some of the Zonks are impractical or physically impossible to receive or deliver to the traders (such as live animals or the guy in an animal costume), or the props are owned by the studio. A disclaimer at the end of the credits of later 1970s episodes read ``Some traders accept reasonable duplicates of Zonk prizes.'' Starting in the 2012--13 season, CBS invited viewers to provide Zonk ideas to producers. At the end of the season, the Zonk declared the most creative was worth $2,500 to the winner, and other viewers' Zonk ideas were also used. For every viewer-developed Zonk, the host announced the viewer who provided the Zonk. The contest has been continued throughout the past several seasons after its 2012 introduction.

Context: In humans, pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli. Whether animals apart from humans also experience pain is often contentious despite being scientifically verifiable. The standard measure of pain in humans is how a person reports that pain, (for example, on a pain scale). ``Pain'' is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as ``an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.'' Only the person experiencing the pain can know the pain's quality and intensity, and the degree of suffering. However, for non-human animals, it is harder, if even possible, to know whether an emotional experience has occurred. Therefore, this concept is often excluded in definitions of pain in animals, such as that provided by Zimmerman: ``an aversive sensory experience caused by actual or potential injury that elicits protective motor and vegetative reactions, results in learned avoidance and may modify species-specific behaviour, including social behaviour.'' Non-human animals cannot report their feelings to language-using humans in the same manner as human communication, but observation of their behaviour provides a reasonable indication as to the extent of their pain. Just as with doctors and medics who sometimes share no common language with their patients, the indicators of pain can still be understood. 
 Question:do animals feel pain the same as humans 
 Answer: True

Context: There is no generally agreed definition of ``business casual''. One definition of business casual states that it includes khaki pants, slacks, and skirts, as well as short-sleeved polo shirts and long-sleeved shirts, but excludes jeans, tennis shoes, tight or short skirts, T-shirts, and sweatshirts. Another source, an American university careers service, states that business casual consists of neutral colors more towards the dark shades of black, gray, navy, but can include white and off white, and reminds that the clothing should be pressed and have clean, crisp seams. The ``Dress for Success'' advice from the University of Toronto sums up business casual as ``a classic, clean cut, and put together look where a full suit is not required,'' which means slacks, khakis, or skirts; blouses, polo shirts, or shirts with collar but no necktie; some sweaters; and closed-toe shoes. The Canadian university ends with the warning that ``it is not clothing you would wear to a club or for athletic purposes... Don't let the word casual mislead you. You still need to look professional.''

His last-meal request was for a plate of two chicken-fried steaks with gravy and sliced onions, a triple-patty bacon cheeseburger, a cheese omelet with ground beef, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, jalapeños, a bowl of fried okra with ketchup, a pound of barbecued meat with half of a loaf of white bread, a portion of three fajitas, a meat-lover's pizza (topped with pepperoni, ham, beef, bacon, and sausage), a pint of Blue Bell ice cream, a slab of peanut-butter fudge with crushed peanuts, and a serving equivalent to three root beers. The abolition followed a complaint by a Texas Senator, John Whitmire (Democrat, of Houston), who called the meal ``inappropriate''. The tradition of customized last meals is thought to have been established around 1924 in Texas.

Context: In his book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Baum describes Kansas as being ``in shades of gray''. Further, Dorothy lived inside a farmhouse which had its paint blistered and washed away by the weather, giving it an air of grayness. The house and property were situated in the middle of a sweeping prairie where the grass was burnt gray by harsh sun. Aunt Em and Uncle Henry were ``gray with age''. Effectively, the use of monochrome sepia tones for the Kansas sequences was a stylistic choice that evoked the dull and gray countryside. Much attention was given to the use of color in the production, with the MGM production crew favoring some hues over others. Consequently, it took the studio's art department almost a week to settle on the final shade of yellow used for the yellow brick road.

Context: Texas hold 'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold 'em, and holdem) is a variation of the card game of poker. Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages. The stages consist of a series of three cards (``the flop''), later an additional single card (``the turn'' or ``fourth street''), and a final card (``the river'' or ``fifth street''). Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from any combination of the seven cards of the five community cards and their own two hole cards. (If a player's best five-card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player's hole cards, it is called ``playing the board''. If you play the board on the river, then you can do no better than tie the other player(s) in the game if no player can make a better hand than the board represents, using either or both hole cards.) Players have betting options to check, call, raise, or fold. Rounds of betting take place before the flop is dealt and after each subsequent deal.

Context: At the beginning of season 5, Sam and Addison are back together, although they break up again as he is still not ready to commit to marriage and a family with her. Jake is hired at the practice, which at first makes Addison uncomfortable. Jake is a very gifted doctor whose speciality is helping women with fertility issues become pregnant. He becomes Addison's doctor and helps her attempt to conceive using IVF. Throughout the season, Addison and Jake grow closer. It is revealed that Jake had a wife, Lily, who was a drug addict and died from an overdose. He adopted her daughter Angela, who is featured in the final 2 seasons of the show. She is often shown advising her father and encourages him to pursue a relationship with Addison, whom he clearly has feelings for. Although Addison still has feelings for Sam, she also has feelings for Jake, the latter of whom wants to get married and have kids. On more than one occasion, Addison and Jake kiss, and both admit to have feelings for the other. However, Jake realizes that Addison is not over Sam and does not want to be a rebound, but tells her he will wait for her. Although Addison decides to stop fertility treatments, her dream of having a child finally comes true and she adopts a baby boy named Henry. Sam begins to regret his decision to leave Addison, and makes excuses to spend time with Henry, but Addison decides to focus on her baby instead of pursuing a relationship with either Sam or Jake. In the season finale, Addison and Jake have sex after Amelia delivers a brainless baby whose organs she donates so that her pregnancy will still be meaningful. When Addison arrives home, Sam is there with Henry and he proposes to Addison. It is not revealed what she says, but we also see that Jake is on his way to her house with flowers and Chinese food.

Context: John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry (also known as John Brown's raid or The raid on Harper's Ferry) was an effort by armed abolitionist John Brown to initiate an armed slave revolt in 1859 by taking over a United States arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia. Brown's party of 22 was defeated by a company of U.S. Marines, led by First Lieutenant Israel Greene. Colonel Robert E. Lee was in overall command of the operation to retake the arsenal. John Brown had originally asked Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass, both of whom he had met in his transformative years as an abolitionist in Springfield, Massachusetts, to join him in his raid, but Tubman was prevented by illness and Douglass declined, as he believed Brown's plan would fail.

Context: In the season's (and series') final episode, Erica delivers Monica's and Chandler's baby, although, to their surprise, she had twins, a boy and a girl. Phoebe and Ross go to the airport to try to convince Rachel to stay, but they end up going to the wrong airport. After Phoebe causes a delay in the departure, they meet Rachel at the gate before she boards, but even though Ross tells her how he feels, Rachel still boards. Ross goes back home only to find a message from Rachel saying she made a mistake. As she is hindered by a stewardess from getting off the plane, the connection breaks. Ross frantically tries to fix the machine, wondering if she got off the plane. Rachel enters Ross' apartment and says ``I got off the plane''. They kiss and declare their love for each other. The last scene of the series is everyone putting their keys on the table in Monica's apartment. When Rachel asks if they want to go for one last coffee, Chandler replies with the last sarcastic word of the show, ``Where?''. The camera then pans across the empty apartment, before landing on the door. The show then fades to black. The tag scene pans around New York.

Context: Guido maintains this story right until the end when, in the chaos of shutting down the camp as the Allied forces approach, he tells his son to stay in a box until everybody has left, this being the final task in the competition before the promised tank is his. Guido goes to find Dora, but he is caught by a German soldier. An officer makes the decision to execute Guido, who is led off by the soldier. While he is walking to his death, Guido passes by Giosuè one last time, still in character and playing the game. Guido is then shot and left for dead in an alleyway. The next morning, Giosuè emerges from the sweat-box, just as a US Army unit led by a Sherman tank arrives and the camp is liberated. Giosuè is overjoyed about winning the game, and an American soldier allows Giosuè to ride on the tank. While travelling to safety, Giosuè soon spots Dora in the procession leaving the camp and reunites with his mother. While the young Giosuè excitedly tells his mother about how he had won a tank, just as his father had promised, the adult Giosuè, in an overheard monologue, reminisces on the sacrifices his father made for him.

Context: In each season, eight drivers and their nominators-- Canada's Worst Driver 11 had nine drivers; more on this later-- are enrolled at the Driver Rehabilitation Centre where they compete in challenges designed to improve their driving skills, in an effort to not be named Canada's Worst Driver. In the first challenge, the contestants begin at a location about an hour's drive from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. Following the directions that are given, each contestant must drive to the Driver Rehabilitation Centre where, upon arriving, the driver's license of each contestant is confiscated (for the first two seasons, their car keys were confiscated instead). The first episode concludes with an obstacle course or assessment challenge, meant to evaluate the skills of each driver. The series is well known for its obstacle course challenges. Contestants must routinely maneuver their cars through tight spaces with less than an inch of clearance on either side. To show that the challenge can be done without hitting obstacles by an average driver, host Andrew Younghusband, himself an average driver, performs each challenge before any contestant attempts said challenge. At the end of each episode, starting with the second episode of each season, each contestant meets with Andrew and a panel of four experts for an evaluation of his or her performance. After all remaining contestants are interviewed, the experts and Andrew deliberate on which contestant and nominator pair have improved enough to graduate from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. The driver who has graduated is eliminated from the competition and is sent home with his or her license returned to him or her. Typically, the contestants drive off with their nominators in the car that they used to arrive at the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. During the series, the experts also reserve the right to not graduate anyone during an episode or to graduate multiple contestants at the same time. The experts may also choose to expel any contestant prematurely who does not show any incentive to learn, who they believe should not continue driving or who can not continue the rehabilitation program often for medical or legal reasons. In this particular instance, certain contestants are eliminated from the competition and their licenses are returned and they are given a ride home by their nominators. However, a prematurely expelled contestant or contestant who refuses to continue may still be considered for the title, as was the case in Canada's Worst Driver Ever, in which Dale Pitton was expelled in the second-to-last episode, only to be brought back for the trophy presentation. In extreme cases, the experts may contact the relevant Ministry of Transport and request that a driver's license be put up for review, if they believe that a contestant is medically unfit to continue driving. To date, this has happened only twice, in Canada's Worst Driver 4 with Donna Hicks and Canada's Worst Driver Ever with Dale. The elimination process continues until only three contestants remain (the original intent was for two contestants to remain, but due to the first season containing an episode in which no one graduated, there were three; every subsequent season has had three finalists). Those three finalists are then given the final challenge, which is typically a three-in-a-car forward-backward slalom within a certain time limit, followed by the Mega Challenge, an obstacle course with elements of almost every previous challenge (the standard transmission balancing challenge, among others, is not part of the Mega Challenge, but every challenge that is practical to include does get included), as well as a driving examination through the busy streets of a major urban centre in Canada near the Driver Rehabilitation Centre (since season seven, the road test has been in Hamilton, Ontario). Based on these three challenges, the experts determine which among the three is Canada's Worst Driver. With the exception of the eighth season, in which both Kevin Simmons and Flora Wang were named Canada's Worst Driver, the contestant who fared the second-worst is deemed to not have graduated from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre, while the contestant who fared the third-worst is considered a graduate (with the exception of the eleventh season, in which, despite faring the third-worst, Sholom Hoffman failed to graduate). Unlike other versions of the Worst Driver series around the world, where being eliminated early is rewarded with a new car while the Worst Driver has their car destroyed, Canada's Worst Driver awards no prizes aside from a trophy for being named the worst, as the point of the show is to educate rather than entertain.

Context: She spends all of Valentine's Day playing sexual role-playing games with Julian, and at the end of the night, he tells her that they should start looking into adopting a child, which Brooke is ecstatic about. The couple goes to an adoption agency and are interviewed by a 19-year-old mother-to-be named Chloe Hall, who's giving her baby up for adoption. Brooke makes her and Julian seem like the perfect couple, and Chloe believes this until she goes to Brooke's house to speak with her and walks into Haley's baby shower, where she hears a little more than she bargained for, such as Victoria's prison time and Brooke losing her company. Despite all of this, she ultimately decides to give her baby to Brooke and Julian when it's born. Chloe informs them that the baby will be coming sooner than expected, causing Brooke to begin trying to get the baby's room together. Chloe talks to Brooke as she's painting the room and tells her about the baby's father and why she chose to give the baby up for adoption, and soon after she leaves to go home, they get a call from the hospital that Chloe has gone into labor and the baby is coming tonight. Brooke and Julian rush to the hospital to be with Chloe for the delivery of their new baby, during which time Chloe says that she would probably be a great mother, she just doesn't want to raise the baby alone. However, Brooke and Julian are shocked when Chloe's boyfriend Eric, the father of her baby, shows up at the hospital and Chloe ends up deciding to keep the baby now that she can raise the little girl with her boyfriend, not alone, leaving Brooke crushed, especially because Chloe had a little baby girl, which is exactly what Brooke wanted. While dealing with the emotional aftermath of the adoption falling through, she receives a job offer from Clothes Over Bros to move to New York and return to the company to design. She discusses this with Victoria, who thinks it's a great idea that she should not turn down, and after Julian tells her he thinks it's a great idea as well, she decides to take the job. However, she later decides to turn down the job after she finds out shockingly enough that she's pregnant, which she finds out after Chase asks Alex to take a drug test for him as he's trying to enter the Air Force but smoked weed during the Kid Cudi show and could not take it, and when he gets a call from the lab saying the person who gave the sample is pregnant, he tells Alex she's pregnant as he thought she took the test but it is revealed that Alex wouldn't have been able to pass the test either as she ate pot brownies that Quinn made so she went to ask Julian to take the test but Brooke took it instead, meaning the person pregnant isn't Alex but actually Brooke. Quinn gets a photoshoot offer for B. Davis magazine to shoot a model in Puerto Rico and she invites Alex, Brooke, and Lauren to go with her. During the trip, Brooke tries to hide her pregnancy from Quinn and Lauren (with Alex already knowing about it because of the drug test) as she and Julian decided they didn't want to tell anybody as it's too early, but Quinn eventually figures it out when Brooke makes it obvious by not eating sushi and throwing all of her alcohol shots over her shoulder to avoid drinking them. When she returns to Tree Hill, she finds that Haley has decided to turn Brooke's former store back into Karen's Cafe now that she's moving to New York, causing Brooke to finally tell Haley that she turned down the job and is staying in Tree Hill because she's pregnant, and instead offers to be Haley's partner so they can open the cafe together.

Context: The series is filmed on location at the World Famous Gold & Silver Pawn Shop in Las Vegas, Nevada. Although jewellery is the most commonly pawned item at the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop, most of the customers featured in episodes bring in a variety of vintage or antique items to the store, which has 12,000 items in its inventory as of July 2011 (5,000 of which are typically held on pawn). Each episode consists of segments devoted to approximately five or six of these items, in which one of the staff members, usually Rick Harrison, his son Corey, or Harrison's father Richard (known as the ``Old Man''), explains the history behind the object. When the buyer is unable to evaluate an object, they consult with a knowledgeable expert who can evaluate it to determine its authenticity and potential value, and in the case of items needing repair, the cost of restoration or preparing the item for sale. Whoever is evaluating the object goes over the potential value with the customer, including the expert's opinion, if one is given, often interspersed with an interview in which he explains the basis of his decision to the viewer. A price tag graphic at the bottom corner of the screen provides the ever-changing dollar amount as the two haggle over the item's price. On occasion, Rick will purchase items in need of restoration before determining its restoration costs, thus taking a risk on such costs.

Context: Another salient aspect of ``My Generation'' is Daltrey's delivery: an angry and frustrated stutter. Various stories exist as to the reason for this distinct delivery. One is that the song began as a slow talking blues number without the stutter (in the 1970s it was sometimes performed as such, but with the stutter, as ``My Generation Blues''), but after being inspired by John Lee Hooker's ``Stuttering Blues,'' Townshend reworked the song into its present form. Another reason is that it was suggested to Daltrey that he stutter to sound like a British mod on speed. It is also proposed, albeit less frequently, that the stutter was introduced to give the group a framework for implying an expletive in the lyrics: ``Why don't you all fff... fade away!'' However, producer Shel Talmy insisted it was simply ``one of those happy accidents'' that he thought they should keep. Roger Daltrey has also commented that he had not rehearsed the song prior to the recording, was nervous, and he was unable to hear his own voice through the monitors. The stutter came about as he tried to fit the lyrics to the music as best he could, and the band decided it worked well enough to keep. The BBC initially refused to play ``My Generation'' because it did not want to offend people who stutter, but it reversed its decision after the song became more popular.

Phoebe and Ross go to the airport to try to convince Rachel to stay, but they end up going to the wrong airport. After Phoebe causes a delay in the departure, they meet Rachel at the gate before she boards, but even though Ross tells her how he feels, Rachel still boards. Ross goes back home only to find a message from Rachel saying she made a mistake. As she is hindered by a stewardess from getting off the plane, the connection breaks. Ross frantically tries to fix the machine, wondering if she got off the plane. Rachel enters Ross' apartment and says ``I got off the plane''. They kiss and declare their love for each other. The last scene of the series is everyone putting their keys on the table in Monica's apartment. When Rachel asks if they want to go for one last coffee, Chandler replies with the last sarcastic word of the show, ``Where?''. The camera then pans across the empty apartment, before landing on the door. The show then fades to black. The tag scene pans around New York.

Context: The revolt of New World British colonists in North America, during the mid-1770s, has been seen as the first assertion of the right of national and democratic self-determination, because of the explicit invocation of natural law, the natural rights of man, as well as the consent of, and sovereignty by, the people governed; these ideas were inspired particularly by John Locke's enlightened writings of the previous century. Thomas Jefferson further promoted the notion that the will of the people was supreme, especially through authorship of the United States Declaration of Independence which inspired Europeans throughout the 19th century. The French Revolution was motivated similarly and legitimatized the ideas of self-determination on that Old World continent.

Context: In the twelfth season, Stephanie must help a patient recover from brain surgery, which brings back bad memories from her childhood of when she was a sickle-cell experiment participant. Jo accuses Stephanie of lying about her disease, and tries to get Stephanie in trouble with Amelia. Stephanie confronts Jo at Meredith's party after Jo gives a misguided apology, saying she can't take the fact that she is better than her at the job and tells her to deal with her shortcomings, as Jo used her sick past as a ``reason'' for her hyper-competence. Jo is left speechless by this. Stephanie later deals with a group of cheerleaders in the hospital. A patient named Kyle comes into the hospital and begins flirting with Stephanie. They eventually become a couple. Meredith teases Stephanie about her new love interest, Kyle, after Stephanie accidentally sends Meredith an explicit text meant for him. Stephanie is kicked off Kyle's case when Amelia finds out that they're a couple. Not being able to operate leads to her breaking up with him. She thinks breaking up with Kyle was a mistake and almost calls him while drunk. Later, she learns Kyle is back in the hospital with suspected meningitis, chose not to tell her and angrily refuses to let her be involved. Stephanie and Kyle reconcile, right before Amelia is unable to save his life in surgery.

Context: At the beginning of season 5, Sam and Addison are back together, although they break up again as he is still not ready to commit to marriage and a family with her. Jake is hired at the practice, which at first makes Addison uncomfortable. Jake is a very gifted doctor whose speciality is helping women with fertility issues become pregnant. He becomes Addison's doctor and helps her attempt to conceive using IVF. Throughout the season, Addison and Jake grow closer. It is revealed that Jake had a wife, Lily, who was a drug addict and died from an overdose. He adopted her daughter Angela, who is featured in the final 2 seasons of the show. She is often shown advising her father and encourages him to pursue a relationship with Addison, whom he clearly has feelings for. Although Addison still has feelings for Sam, she also has feelings for Jake, the latter of whom wants to get married and have kids. On more than one occasion, Addison and Jake kiss, and both admit to have feelings for the other. However, Jake realizes that Addison is not over Sam and does not want to be a rebound, but tells her he will wait for her. Although Addison decides to stop fertility treatments, her dream of having a child finally comes true and she adopts a baby boy named Henry. Sam begins to regret his decision to leave Addison, and makes excuses to spend time with Henry, but Addison decides to focus on her baby instead of pursuing a relationship with either Sam or Jake. In the season finale, Addison and Jake have sex after Amelia delivers a brainless baby whose organs she donates so that her pregnancy will still be meaningful. When Addison arrives home, Sam is there with Henry and he proposes to Addison. It is not revealed what she says, but we also see that Jake is on his way to her house with flowers and Chinese food.

While travelling to safety, Giosuè soon spots Dora in the procession leaving the camp and reunites with his mother. While the young Giosuè excitedly tells his mother about how he had won a tank, just as his father had promised, the adult Giosuè, in an overheard monologue, reminisces on the sacrifices his father made for him.

Context: In the season-six episode ``Ghost'', events surrounding the arrest of Liam Connors (Brian F. O'Byrne), the assassin who shot her, led to Cabot's return from the Witness Protection Program as Connors is arrested for her murder while being pursued for several others and an attempted murder of a young boy who witnessed one of his crimes. She reveals that the assumed identity she was given was an insurance salesperson originally from Tulsa, that she was living and working in Wisconsin under the name ``Emily'', and that she missed her mother's funeral in New York due to what happened. She is reluctant to see him convicted of a murder he did not commit (he does not know she is alive, either), but still wants justice and testifies against him in court. Connors goes to prison, having been found guilty under two counts of attempted murder (Cabot and an eight-year-old boy), plus five counts of murder. Upon winning the case, the SVU squad goes to Novak's office to celebrate, awaiting Cabot to join them. She does not show up, as the federal agent informs them that she has moved under a new identity and she asked him to say goodbye.

Context: If a player is able to meld all of their cards at once, they may say ``Rummy'' on their turn and go out. To declare Rummy, a player must not have melded or laid off any cards prior during the hand. If playing with the discard rule, they must also discard after melding. If a player goes rummy when a card can be played, that player is out for that turn. Game players are still in game but the hand goes dead. Playing for Rummy is more risky, but it carries the reward of double the score. Each player must wait until their second turn to go out. If there is a rummy lying in the pile, the player who called ``rummy'' can play that card while the player who laid the rummy must then draw 2 cards from the stock pile or pick up the entire discarded pile.

Context: Dr. Bailey is in labor, and without her husband Tucker Jones by her side, she refuses to push so she can give birth. George works with Addison to convince Bailey to have the baby. He finally gets through to Bailey by giving her the motivation that she needs, and ultimately he holds her while she delivers the baby. Izzie and Alex have sex again. Chief Richard Webber is under a lot of stress from everything that's been going on, and it is believed that he is having a heart attack, which lures his wife Adele to the hospita(anxiety attack)). Dr. Bailey's husband goes into cardiac arrest. Meredith finally removes the explosive from the patient, and Dylan, the leader of the bomb squad, carries it away. Meredith steps out of the operating room into the hallway, curiously watching Dylan walk away with the explosive, and at that moment, the bomb explodes, killing Dylan and a second bomb squad member. Meredith is knocked unconscious by the explosion. There is a revival of the ``shower scene'' from the first part, but with a more serious tone: the fully clothed Izzie and Cristina wash blood off of a stunned Meredith as George looks on. Dr. Bailey's husband and the man who had the explosive embedded in his body both survive. At the end of the episode, Preston and Derek become friends, overcoming their initial rivalry in the series beginning, and call each other by their first names. Cristina says ``I love you, too'' to a sleeping Preston. Derek comes to visit Meredith and says, ``You almost died today,'' and Meredith tells him that she can't remember their last kiss. Derek recalls the kiss for her, telling her that she ``smelled like some kind of flower,'' which Meredith says was lavender, and then he leaves.

Context: In the Season 5 premiere, ``Weight Loss'', Pam begins her three-month course at the Pratt Institute. In this episode, Jim proposes in the pouring rain at a rest stop, saying that he ``can't wait''. In ``Business Trip'', Pam learns that she is failing one of her classes and will have to remain in New York another three months to retake it.

In ``Two Weeks'', Pam agrees to become Michael's first saleswoman in his not-yet-established company, The Michael Scott Paper Co., as a supportive Jim looks on. When David Wallace makes an offer to buy the company Michael negotiates in order to get their jobs at Dunder Mifflin back instead, including adding Pam to the sales team.

Context: Taylor Hayes is a fictional character from the American CBS soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful, portrayed by Hunter Tylo. The character was created by William J. Bell and debuted during the episode dated June 6, 1990. Tylo appeared as a regular continuously until 1994 when she took a hiatus for a few months before being written back into the series. In 1996, she left the serial after being cast on Melrose Place, where she was soon fired on the grounds of being pregnant, and returned shortly after. In 2002, Tylo and the show's executive producer Bradley Bell had mutually agreed that the character was ``played out'', and Taylor was subsequently killed off, last appearing on October 30, 2002. Tylo returned in 2004, reprising Taylor as a ghost. She returned on a permanent basis in April 2005, with the character revealed to be alive. Tylo exited The Bold and the Beautiful again in July 2013, but returned for multiple guest appearances in 2014. She returned again in April 2018.

Grammer used an acting method he called ``requisite disrespect'' and did not rehearse with the others, instead learning and rehearsing his lines once just before filming each scene in front of a live studio audience.

In 1996, Grammer's recurrent alcoholism led to a car accident; the cast and crew performed an intervention that persuaded him to enter the Betty Ford Clinic, delaying production for a month.

Context: The revolt of New World British colonists in North America, during the mid-1770s, has been seen as the first assertion of the right of national and democratic self-determination, because of the explicit invocation of natural law, the natural rights of man, as well as the consent of, and sovereignty by, the people governed; these ideas were inspired particularly by John Locke's enlightened writings of the previous century. Thomas Jefferson further promoted the notion that the will of the people was supreme, especially through authorship of the United States Declaration of Independence which inspired Europeans throughout the 19th century. The French Revolution was motivated similarly and legitimatized the ideas of self-determination on that Old World continent.

Context: There is much debate over which characters in Family Guy can understand Stewie. In an interview, MacFarlane said that everyone can basically understand him, but they ignore him or just think to themselves ``oh how cute'' when he talks. However at the 2011 ComicCon panel, he compared this to Wile E. Coyote in the old Merrie Melodies cartoons. MacFarlane went on to say that Brian always hears Stewie, and more recently so does Chris, but the writers usually strive for Peter, Lois, and Meg not to hear him. Once Stewie leaves the house, the question of who can hear him depends very much on the story. MacFarlane also states that these rules can be broken for the sake of comedy, so this could change from one episode to another. In ``Inside Family Guy'', Peter apologizes to the family, to which Stewie comments: ``Oh that's nice of you to say''. Peter replies: ``Thank you, Stewie, who I can understand'', referring to the ongoing discussion whether or not family members, other than Brian, are able to understand him. However, Peter's response seems to be a part of the episode's offset setting, where everyone is out of character.

Context: E3 2011 trailer of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception showed Elena helping Drake and Sully again. It also revealed she's now wearing a ring on her left ring finger. During the game it is revealed that she and Drake were married, and later broke up in between the events of Uncharted 2 and 3, due to what we can only believe was to keep Elena safe. Since the events Uncharted 2, Elena has become an international news correspondent, and has been stationed in Yemen for some time. Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan discover that Sir Francis Drake made a stop in Yemen on his quest to find the Atlantis of the Sands. Since the two needed to get into Yemen quietly and without opposition, Sullivan called Elena to ask for her help, as Drake was reluctant to speak to her. When Drake and Sullivan arrive in Yemen, Elena gives them permits and talks to them happily as they exit the airport. But Drake and Elena begin to argue over their sudden arrival and over Elena's wedding band. Nate is more interested by the fact that she is still wearing her wedding ring from their estranged marriage. She claims 'it helps in this part of the world' and tells him not to flatter himself. Nate just smiles, knowing she's not being entirely honest with him. But Elena suspects that Nate is not being honest with her, and is worried about his obsession with Sir Francis Drake's expedition. She also voices her concern about Sullivan, and that Nate shouldn't make him run across the globe for him. Elena takes Drake and Sullivan on a walking tour through Yemen, with the Old Quarter as their targeted destination. In order to dodge the city's guards, the trio climb up to the roof tops. From there, Sullivan spots Talbot walking through the town. Drake pursues him, and is eventually cornered by Marlowe's guards. Once Nate defeats the guards, Elena leads Sullivan and Drake into a courtyard. Coincidentally, the courtyard contains a well that contains the coordinates to Iram. While in the catacombs, the three discover a hidden chamber with messages written on the walls, warning about the dangers of Iram and the desert. Nate deduces that these messages were written by Sir Francis Drake. Elena asks Nate to stop looking for Iram.

Context: At the beginning of season 5, Sam and Addison are back together, although they break up again as he is still not ready to commit to marriage and a family with her. Jake is hired at the practice, which at first makes Addison uncomfortable. Jake is a very gifted doctor whose speciality is helping women with fertility issues become pregnant. He becomes Addison's doctor and helps her attempt to conceive using IVF. Throughout the season, Addison and Jake grow closer. It is revealed that Jake had a wife, Lily, who was a drug addict and died from an overdose. He adopted her daughter Angela, who is featured in the final 2 seasons of the show. She is often shown advising her father and encourages him to pursue a relationship with Addison, whom he clearly has feelings for. Although Addison still has feelings for Sam, she also has feelings for Jake, the latter of whom wants to get married and have kids. On more than one occasion, Addison and Jake kiss, and both admit to have feelings for the other. However, Jake realizes that Addison is not over Sam and does not want to be a rebound, but tells her he will wait for her. Although Addison decides to stop fertility treatments, her dream of having a child finally comes true and she adopts a baby boy named Henry. Sam begins to regret his decision to leave Addison, and makes excuses to spend time with Henry, but Addison decides to focus on her baby instead of pursuing a relationship with either Sam or Jake. In the season finale, Addison and Jake have sex after Amelia delivers a brainless baby whose organs she donates so that her pregnancy will still be meaningful. When Addison arrives home, Sam is there with Henry and he proposes to Addison. It is not revealed what she says, but we also see that Jake is on his way to her house with flowers and Chinese food.

Context: Melody Brooks is an eleven-year-old girl who was born with Cerebral Palsy. Her parents have done everything they can to help her live a normal life, but life is often frustrating for Melody since she cannot speak, move, or communicate her wishes. As a result, Melody has to fight to get her wishes. At age five, Melody is even diagnosed as profoundly retarded. Despite this, Melody's mom enrolls her in Spaulding Street Elementary school to get the education she needs. However, the class she is put in is like a baby class, learning the same things every day. Melody is frustrated by this. Her neighbor, Mrs. V., is a kind, but tough woman. She pushes Melody to do the best she can. When Melody was three, Mrs. V. wasn't impressed for Melody to rely on her parents for everything. Because of this, Mrs. V. forced her to learn how to crawl and roll on the ground. She even taught Melody how to catch herself whenever she fell from her wheelchair. These things helped Melody become self-sufficient, but she continues to be reliant on her parents to help feed her and help her go to the bathroom. When Melody turns eight, her mother becomes pregnant. During this time, Melody overhears them talking about the new baby and their fears that it will suffer the same disabilities. Melody feels ashamed when she hears this. However, Melody is happy when the baby, Penny, is born perfectly healthy. Melody feels jealous as Penny grows and matures since she'll never be able to do the things Penny can do. However, Melody loves her little sister, and the pleasures Melody brings to her parents. When Melody enters fifth grade, she gets a communication device that allows her to talk with other people. At school, her new teacher starts an inclusion program that allows the special needs students to participate in the standard classes. Melody also gets an aide, Catherine, to help her. Melody befriends Rose Spencer, but is bullied by Molly and Claire, who believe that Melody's disability makes her dumber than them. Even her teacher, Mr. Dimming, believes that Melody cannot participate, but is surprised that not only does Melody join, but passes a test exam of a trivia competition with a perfect score. When he tells his class that if Melody can ace it, he is giving way too easy questions, Melody works with Ms. V in order to win the real tryouts, which she does so with a perfect score. Melody then helps the team win the qualifying competition to earn a trip to Washington D.C. for the national competition. However, on the day the group is to fly to Washington, Melody learns that her flight has been canceled due to weather, but that the rest of the team has made an earlier flight without her. Melody insists the day after the fiasco on going to school, but her mom's dismal attitude causes her to accidentally run over Penny despite Melody's attempts to warn her mother. Melody blames herself for not being able to inform her mom, even though everyone, especially Mrs. V., tells her it's not her fault. Although Melody is terrified that Penny will have a brain injury like her and be like her, she learns that Penny is going to be okay, and just has a cast on her leg. On Monday, Melody's class also apologizes for their lack of being considerate towards her by giving her their ninth place trophy, hoping to reconcile with her. However, Melody just's laughs at them and destroys the trophy by accident and says ``no you take it'' and heads out of the room. The next day, she and Catherine begin work on Melody's autobiography, which begins with the first few lines of the book.

The final scene is a shot of the apartment, panning round slowly from the living space to the front door.

Context: The traditional American business hours are 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday to Friday, representing a workweek of five eight-hour days comprising 40 hours in total. These are the origin of the phrase 9-to-5, used to describe a conventional and possibly tedious job. Negatively used, it connotes a tedious or unremarkable occupation. The phrase also indicates that a person is an employee, usually in a large company, rather than and entrepreneur or self-employed. More neutrally, it connotes a job with stable hours and low career risk, but still a position of subordinate employment. The actual time at work often varies between 35 and 48 hours in practice due to the inclusion, or lack of inclusion, of breaks. In many traditional white collar positions, employees were required to be in the office during these hours to take orders from the bosses, hence the relationship between this phrase and subordination. Workplace hours have become more flexible, but the phrase is still commonly used.

Ricky leaves to find help and runs into a girl his age named Kahu. She takes him back to her house and introduces him to her dad. Ricky stays the night and returns next morning to the hut where Hec was supposed to be. Ricky finds the place to be swarming with police, led by Paula. Ricky runs away. He later encounters Paula and Andy in the bush, separated by a ravine. Paula attempts to bribe Ricky, asking him to say that Hec was a sex offender. In return, she tells him that he won't ever go to juvenile prison. Ricky declines and runs away. Ricky catches up to Hec by remembering the survival strategies Hec taught him, and they continue their travels. After a traumatic encounter with a wild boar during which Hec's dog Zag is mortally wounded, forcing Hec to euthanize her, Ricky reveals he has been carrying Bella's ashes and originally planned to deliver them to ``where the earth wets the cloak of the sky,'' as per her wishes. They scatter Bella's ashes into a remote waterfall high in a mountain range. Ricky and Hec find a man living out on his own called Psycho Sam (Darby). Sam lets them stay the night.

Context: A drinking establishment is a business whose primary function is the serving of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. Some establishments may also serve food, or have entertainment, but their main purpose is to serve alcoholic beverages. There are different types of drinking establishment ranging from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed ``dive bars'', to 5,000 seat beer halls and elegant places of entertainment for the elite. A public house, informally known as a ``pub'', is an establishment licensed to serve alcoholic drinks for consumption on the premises in countries and regions of British influence. Although the terms are increasingly used to refer to the same thing, there is a difference between pubs, bars, inns, taverns and lounges where alcohol is served commercially. A tavern or pot-house is, loosely, a place of business where people gather to drink alcoholic beverages and, more than likely, also be served food, though not licensed to put up guests. The word derives from the Latin taberna and the Greek ταβέρνα/taverna.

Context: In the twelfth season, Stephanie must help a patient recover from brain surgery, which brings back bad memories from her childhood of when she was a sickle-cell experiment participant. Jo accuses Stephanie of lying about her disease, and tries to get Stephanie in trouble with Amelia. Stephanie confronts Jo at Meredith's party after Jo gives a misguided apology, saying she can't take the fact that she is better than her at the job and tells her to deal with her shortcomings, as Jo used her sick past as a ``reason'' for her hyper-competence. Jo is left speechless by this. Stephanie later deals with a group of cheerleaders in the hospital. A patient named Kyle comes into the hospital and begins flirting with Stephanie. They eventually become a couple. Meredith teases Stephanie about her new love interest, Kyle, after Stephanie accidentally sends Meredith an explicit text meant for him. Stephanie is kicked off Kyle's case when Amelia finds out that they're a couple. Not being able to operate leads to her breaking up with him. She thinks breaking up with Kyle was a mistake and almost calls him while drunk. Later, she learns Kyle is back in the hospital with suspected meningitis, chose not to tell her and angrily refuses to let her be involved. Stephanie and Kyle reconcile, right before Amelia is unable to save his life in surgery.

Context: In humans, pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli. Whether animals apart from humans also experience pain is often contentious despite being scientifically verifiable. The standard measure of pain in humans is how a person reports that pain, (for example, on a pain scale). ``Pain'' is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as ``an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.'' Only the person experiencing the pain can know the pain's quality and intensity, and the degree of suffering. However, for non-human animals, it is harder, if even possible, to know whether an emotional experience has occurred. Therefore, this concept is often excluded in definitions of pain in animals, such as that provided by Zimmerman: ``an aversive sensory experience caused by actual or potential injury that elicits protective motor and vegetative reactions, results in learned avoidance and may modify species-specific behaviour, including social behaviour.'' Non-human animals cannot report their feelings to language-using humans in the same manner as human communication, but observation of their behaviour provides a reasonable indication as to the extent of their pain. Just as with doctors and medics who sometimes share no common language with their patients, the indicators of pain can still be understood.

Context: At the beginning of season 5, Sam and Addison are back together, although they break up again as he is still not ready to commit to marriage and a family with her. Jake is hired at the practice, which at first makes Addison uncomfortable. Jake is a very gifted doctor whose speciality is helping women with fertility issues become pregnant. He becomes Addison's doctor and helps her attempt to conceive using IVF. Throughout the season, Addison and Jake grow closer. It is revealed that Jake had a wife, Lily, who was a drug addict and died from an overdose. He adopted her daughter Angela, who is featured in the final 2 seasons of the show. She is often shown advising her father and encourages him to pursue a relationship with Addison, whom he clearly has feelings for. Although Addison still has feelings for Sam, she also has feelings for Jake, the latter of whom wants to get married and have kids. On more than one occasion, Addison and Jake kiss, and both admit to have feelings for the other. However, Jake realizes that Addison is not over Sam and does not want to be a rebound, but tells her he will wait for her. Although Addison decides to stop fertility treatments, her dream of having a child finally comes true and she adopts a baby boy named Henry. Sam begins to regret his decision to leave Addison, and makes excuses to spend time with Henry, but Addison decides to focus on her baby instead of pursuing a relationship with either Sam or Jake. In the season finale, Addison and Jake have sex after Amelia delivers a brainless baby whose organs she donates so that her pregnancy will still be meaningful. When Addison arrives home, Sam is there with Henry and he proposes to Addison. It is not revealed what she says, but we also see that Jake is on his way to her house with flowers and Chinese food.

Context: Dr. Bailey is in labor, and without her husband Tucker Jones by her side, she refuses to push so she can give birth. George works with Addison to convince Bailey to have the baby. He finally gets through to Bailey by giving her the motivation that she needs, and ultimately he holds her while she delivers the baby. Izzie and Alex have sex again. Chief Richard Webber is under a lot of stress from everything that's been going on, and it is believed that he is having a heart attack, which lures his wife Adele to the hospital. However, it proves to be just an anxiety attack. Dr. Bailey's husband goes into cardiac arrest. Meredith finally removes the explosive from the patient, and Dylan, the leader of the bomb squad, carries it away. Meredith steps out of the operating room into the hallway, curiously watching Dylan walk away with the explosive, and at that moment, the bomb explodes, killing Dylan and a second bomb squad member. Meredith is knocked unconscious by the explosion. There is a revival of the ``shower scene'' from the first part, but with a more serious tone: the fully clothed Izzie and Cristina wash blood off of a stunned Meredith as George looks on. Dr. Bailey's husband and the man who had the explosive embedded in his body both survive. At the end of the episode, Preston and Derek become friends, overcoming their initial rivalry in the series beginning, and call each other by their first names. Cristina says ``I love you, too'' to a sleeping Preston. Derek comes to visit Meredith and says, ``You almost died today,'' and Meredith tells him that she can't remember their last kiss. Derek recalls the kiss for her, telling her that she ``smelled like some kind of flower,'' which Meredith says was lavender, and then he leaves.

Context: She spends all of Valentine's Day playing sexual role-playing games with Julian, and at the end of the night, he tells her that they should start looking into adopting a child, which Brooke is ecstatic about. The couple goes to an adoption agency and are interviewed by a 19-year-old mother-to-be named Chloe Hall, who's giving her baby up for adoption. Brooke makes her and Julian seem like the perfect couple, and Chloe believes this until she goes to Brooke's house to speak with her and walks into Haley's baby shower, where she hears a little more than she bargained for, such as Victoria's prison time and Brooke losing her company. Despite all of this, she ultimately decides to give her baby to Brooke and Julian when it's born. Chloe informs them that the baby will be coming sooner than expected, causing Brooke to begin trying to get the baby's room together. Chloe talks to Brooke as she's painting the room and tells her about the baby's father and why she chose to give the baby up for adoption, and soon after she leaves to go home, they get a call from the hospital that Chloe has gone into labor and the baby is coming tonight. Brooke and Julian rush to the hospital to be with Chloe for the delivery of their new baby, during which time Chloe says that she would probably be a great mother, she just doesn't want to raise the baby alone. However, Brooke and Julian are shocked when Chloe's boyfriend Eric, the father of her baby, shows up at the hospital and Chloe ends up deciding to keep the baby now that she can raise the little girl with her boyfriend, not alone, leaving Brooke crushed, especially because Chloe had a little baby girl, which is exactly what Brooke wanted. While dealing with the emotional aftermath of the adoption falling through, she receives a job offer from Clothes Over Bros to move to New York and return to the company to design. She discusses this with Victoria, who thinks it's a great idea that she should not turn down, and after Julian tells her he thinks it's a great idea as well, she decides to take the job. However, she later decides to turn down the job after she finds out shockingly enough that she's pregnant, which she finds out after Chase asks Alex to take a drug test for him as he's trying to enter the Air Force but smoked weed during the Kid Cudi show and could not take it, and when he gets a call from the lab saying the person who gave the sample is pregnant, he tells Alex she's pregnant as he thought she took the test but it is revealed that Alex wouldn't have been able to pass the test either as she ate pot brownies that Quinn made so she went to ask Julian to take the test but Brooke took it instead, meaning the person pregnant isn't Alex but actually Brooke. Quinn gets a photoshoot offer for B. Davis magazine to shoot a model in Puerto Rico and she invites Alex, Brooke, and Lauren to go with her. During the trip, Brooke tries to hide her pregnancy from Quinn and Lauren (with Alex already knowing about it because of the drug test) as she and Julian decided they didn't want to tell anybody as it's too early, but Quinn eventually figures it out when Brooke makes it obvious by not eating sushi and throwing all of her alcohol shots over her shoulder to avoid drinking them. When she returns to Tree Hill, she finds that Haley has decided to turn Brooke's former store back into Karen's Cafe now that she's moving to New York, causing Brooke to finally tell Haley that she turned down the job and is staying in Tree Hill because she's pregnant, and instead offers to be Haley's partner so they can open the cafe together.

Context: Dwight is the only person that Angela likes in the office. It is shown in ``E-mail Surveillance'' that Dwight and Angela have begun a romantic relationship. Although she has said she loves Dwight and cares about him, she refuses to tell anyone about their relationship, and is often made uncomfortable by Dwight's passion for her. Their relationship is seemingly summarized in ``A.A.R.M.'': when Dwight tells her that yelling through a megaphone expresses ``how loudly I love you'', Angela meekly whispers ``It's too loud.'' In ``Traveling Salesman'' Angela forgets to send an accounting folder to corporate, so Dwight drives to New York and gives the folder to them. After Dwight is told he would be fired if he didn't tell Michael why he went to New York, he keeps their relationship secret out of respect for Angela. Angela later tells Michael what happened, but still doesn't reveal their relationship. In ``Fun Run'' Angela asks Dwight to feed her cat Sprinkles, who is feeling sick, but Dwight kills it, which causes Angela to break up with him. After Angela begins a relationship with Andy in Season 4, she stops dating Dwight, but at the end of ``Goodbye Toby'' Phyllis sees Angela cheating on Andy with Dwight. Dwight ends their affair in ``The Duel'' after learning that she has been having sexual relations with Andy. In ``The Delivery'' Dwight, who wants to improve his sales by having a child, asks Angela to have his baby. The two write up a contract and plan to have a baby together, but in ``Happy Hour'', Dwight hooks up with Pam's friend Isabel, and tells Angela he doesn't want her to have his baby. In ``The Chump'' the two call in a lawyer, and Angela refuses to release him from the contract unless he agrees to have sex with her five times. She later voids the contract after meeting Senator Robert Lipton. After she gives birth (Jury Duty), Dwight realizes the baby was conceived before her marriage to Robert and makes the assumption that he, not Robert, is the father. Angela and Dwight go through a paternity test and in ``New Guys'' it is revealed that Dwight is not Philip's father. In ``A.A.R.M.'' Dwight proposes to Angela, and she accepts. She then tells Dwight that she lied before and Dwight is Philip's father. Angela tells him that she wanted to make sure that Dwight wanted to marry her for no other reason than for love.

Context: Leslie Dixon adapted the screenplay from the book of the same name by Catherine Ryan Hyde, which was available as an open writing assignment. Dixon struggled with the adaptation of the book in part because of multiple narrative voices within it. Specifically in that the reporter, the central character in the film, does not show up until halfway through the novel. Stuck, Dixon considered returning the money she was paid for the assignment. She eventually hit upon the idea to start with the reporter and trace the events backwards. Dixon presented the idea to Hyde who in turn liked it so much that she decided to change the then unpublished novel's plot structure to mirror the film's. In the novel, the character of Eugene Simonet was originally an African-American man named Reuben St. Clair. The role was offered to Denzel Washington, but he turned it down. Kevin Spacey was contacted next and accepted the role.

Context: In the season's (and series') final episode, Erica delivers Monica's and Chandler's baby, although, to their surprise, she had twins, a boy and a girl. Phoebe and Ross go to the airport to try to convince Rachel to stay, but they end up going to the wrong airport. After Phoebe causes a delay in the departure, they meet Rachel at the gate before she boards, but even though Ross tells her how he feels, Rachel still boards. Ross goes back home only to find a message from Rachel saying she made a mistake. As she is hindered by a stewardess from getting off the plane, the connection breaks. Ross frantically tries to fix the machine, wondering if she got off the plane. Rachel enters Ross' apartment and says ``I got off the plane''. They kiss and declare their love for each other. The last scene of the series is everyone putting their keys on the table in Monica's apartment. When Rachel asks if they want to go for one last coffee, Chandler replies with the last sarcastic word of the show, ``Where?''. The camera then pans across the empty apartment, before landing on the door. The show then fades to black. The tag scene pans around New York.

Context: Mary Ellen (Judy Norton Taylor) is the oldest of Liv and John's daughters, born in April 1920, aged 13 in season one. Throughout the first few seasons, she is a typically whiny, sometimes rebellious teenager, somewhat of a tomboy who enjoys playing baseball, but could also be vain, engaging in a rivalry with rich-girl Martha-Rose Coverdale for the affections of the awkward G.W. Haines (David Doremus). Mary Ellen matures into a wiser young woman and her childish fantasy of becoming a movie star gives way for a more reasonable and realistic ambition to go into medicine after reading up on it and developing an interest. She then works to gain an education as a medical worker, and becomes a nurse. However, when she ends up taking care of the people out in the country by herself, she concludes they need more medical expertise than she can offer them and continues studying medicine until she succeeds in becoming a fully-fledged doctor. Even though some people frown upon female doctors and she receives mixed support from her family, she refuses to let this stop her. Mary Ellen has a special relationship with each of her six siblings, but she is especially close to her younger sister Erin. Mary Ellen and Erin fought a lot when they were younger girls, particularly in seasons 1 and 2. But in the middle seasons, Mary Ellen and Erin matured and became friends. In season 5 after Mary Ellen married Curt, her relationship with her sister deepened even further and by the end of the show, they truly did become each other's best friend.

Context: Compulsive talking (or talkaholism) is talking that goes beyond the bounds of what is considered to be socially acceptable. The main factors in determining if someone is a compulsive talker are talking in a continuous manner or stopping only when the other person starts talking, and others perceiving their talking as a problem. Personality traits that have been positively linked to this compulsion include assertiveness, willingness to communicate, self-perceived communication competence, and neuroticism. Studies have shown that most people who are talkaholics are aware of the amount of talking they do, are unable to stop, or do not see it as a problem.

Context: A teaching assistant or teacher's aide (TA) or education assistant (EA) is an individual who assists a teacher with instructional responsibilities. TAs include: graduate teaching assistants (GTAs), who are graduate students; undergraduate teaching assistants (UTAs), who are undergraduate students; secondary school TAs, who are either high school students or adults; and elementary school TAs, who are adults (also known as paraprofessional educators or teacher's aides). By definition, TAs assist with classes, but many graduate students serve as the sole instructor for one or more classes each semester as a teaching fellow or graduate student instructor. Graduate and adult TAs generally have a fixed salary determined by each contract period (usually a semester or an academic year); however, undergraduates and high school students are sometimes unpaid and, in the US and other countries with the credit system, receive course credits in return for their assistance. Teaching assistants often help the main teacher by managing students with learning disabilities, such as ADHD, Autism, or even physical disabilities, such as blindness or deafness.

Context: In Stage three (good intentions as determined by social consensus), the self enters society by conforming to social standards. Individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects society's views. They try to be a ``good boy'' or ``good girl'' to live up to these expectations, having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self. Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person's relationships, which now begin to include things like respect, gratitude, and the ``golden rule''. ``I want to be liked and thought well of; apparently, not being naughty makes people like me.'' Conforming to the rules for one's social role is not yet fully understood. The intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage; one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that ``they mean well''.

Context: At the beginning of season 5, Sam and Addison are back together, although they break up again as he is still not ready to commit to marriage and a family with her. Jake is hired at the practice, which at first makes Addison uncomfortable. Jake is a very gifted doctor whose speciality is helping women with fertility issues become pregnant. He becomes Addison's doctor and helps her attempt to conceive using IVF. Throughout the season, Addison and Jake grow closer. It is revealed that Jake had a wife, Lily, who was a drug addict and died from an overdose. He adopted her daughter Angela, who is featured in the final 2 seasons of the show. She is often shown advising her father and encourages him to pursue a relationship with Addison, whom he clearly has feelings for. Although Addison still has feelings for Sam, she also has feelings for Jake, the latter of whom wants to get married and have kids. On more than one occasion, Addison and Jake kiss, and both admit to have feelings for the other. However, Jake realizes that Addison is not over Sam and does not want to be a rebound, but tells her he will wait for her. Although Addison decides to stop fertility treatments, her dream of having a child finally comes true and she adopts a baby boy named Henry. Sam begins to regret his decision to leave Addison, and makes excuses to spend time with Henry, but Addison decides to focus on her baby instead of pursuing a relationship with either Sam or Jake. In the season finale, Addison and Jake have sex after Amelia delivers a brainless baby whose organs she donates so that her pregnancy will still be meaningful. When Addison arrives home, Sam is there with Henry and he proposes to Addison. It is not revealed what she says, but we also see that Jake is on his way to her house with flowers and Chinese food.

Context: In each season, eight drivers and their nominators-- Canada's Worst Driver 11 had nine drivers; more on this later-- are enrolled at the Driver Rehabilitation Centre where they compete in challenges designed to improve their driving skills, in an effort to not be named Canada's Worst Driver. In the first challenge, the contestants begin at a location about an hour's drive from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. Following the directions that are given, each contestant must drive to the Driver Rehabilitation Centre where, upon arriving, the driver's license of each contestant is confiscated (for the first two seasons, their car keys were confiscated instead). The first episode concludes with an obstacle course or assessment challenge, meant to evaluate the skills of each driver. The series is well known for its obstacle course challenges. Contestants must routinely maneuver their cars through tight spaces with less than an inch of clearance on either side. To show that the challenge can be done without hitting obstacles by an average driver, host Andrew Younghusband, himself an average driver, performs each challenge before any contestant attempts said challenge. At the end of each episode, starting with the second episode of each season, each contestant meets with Andrew and a panel of four experts for an evaluation of his or her performance. After all remaining contestants are interviewed, the experts and Andrew deliberate on which contestant and nominator pair have improved enough to graduate from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. The driver who has graduated is eliminated from the competition and is sent home with his or her license returned to him or her. Typically, the contestants drive off with their nominators in the car that they used to arrive at the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. During the series, the experts also reserve the right to not graduate anyone during an episode or to graduate multiple contestants at the same time. The experts may also choose to expel any contestant prematurely who does not show any incentive to learn, who they believe should not continue driving or who can not continue the rehabilitation program often for medical or legal reasons. In this particular instance, certain contestants are eliminated from the competition and their licenses are returned and they are given a ride home by their nominators. However, a prematurely expelled contestant or contestant who refuses to continue may still be considered for the title, as was the case in Canada's Worst Driver Ever, in which Dale Pitton was expelled in the second-to-last episode, only to be brought back for the trophy presentation. In extreme cases, the experts may contact the relevant Ministry of Transport and request that a driver's license be put up for review, if they believe that a contestant is medically unfit to continue driving. To date, this has happened only twice, in Canada's Worst Driver 4 with Donna Hicks and Canada's Worst Driver Ever with Dale. The elimination process continues until only three contestants remain (the original intent was for two contestants to remain, but due to the first season containing an episode in which no one graduated, there were three; every subsequent season has had three finalists). Those three finalists are then given the final challenge, which is typically a three-in-a-car forward-backward slalom within a certain time limit, followed by the Mega Challenge, an obstacle course with elements of almost every previous challenge (the standard transmission balancing challenge, among others, is not part of the Mega Challenge, but every challenge that is practical to include does get included), as well as a driving examination through the busy streets of a major urban centre in Canada near the Driver Rehabilitation Centre (since season seven, the road test has been in Hamilton, Ontario). Based on these three challenges, the experts determine which among the three is Canada's Worst Driver. With the exception of the eighth season, in which both Kevin Simmons and Flora Wang were named Canada's Worst Driver, the contestant who fared the second-worst is deemed to not have graduated from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre, while the contestant who fared the third-worst is considered a graduate (with the exception of the eleventh season, in which, despite faring the third-worst, Sholom Hoffman failed to graduate). Unlike other versions of the Worst Driver series around the world, where being eliminated early is rewarded with a new car while the Worst Driver has their car destroyed, Canada's Worst Driver awards no prizes aside from a trophy for being named the worst, as the point of the show is to educate rather than entertain.

After Phoebe causes a delay in the departure, they meet Rachel at the gate before she boards, but even though Ross tells her how he feels, Rachel still boards.

Context: Dr. Bailey is in labor, and without her husband Tucker Jones by her side, she refuses to push so she can give birth. George works with Addison to convince Bailey to have the baby. He finally gets through to Bailey by giving her the motivation that she needs, and ultimately he holds her while she delivers the baby. Izzie and Alex have sex again. Chief Richard Webber is under a lot of stress from everything that's been going on, and it is believed that he is having a heart attack, which lures his wife Adele to the hospital. However, it proves to be just an anxiety attack. Dr. Bailey's husband goes into cardiac arrest. Meredith finally removes the explosive from the patient, and Dylan, the leader of the bomb squad, carries it away. Meredith steps out of the operating room into the hallway, curiously watching Dylan walk away with the explosive, and at that moment, the bomb explodes, killing Dylan and a second bomb squad member. Meredith is knocked unconscious by the explosion. There is a revival of the ``shower scene'' from the first part, but with a more serious tone: the fully clothed Izzie and Cristina wash blood off of a stunned Meredith as George looks on. Dr. Bailey's husband and the man who had the explosive embedded in his body both survive. At the end of the episode, Preston and Derek become friends, overcoming their initial rivalry in the series beginning, and call each other by their first names. Cristina says ``I love you, too'' to a sleeping Preston. Derek comes to visit Meredith and says, ``You almost died today,'' and Meredith tells him that she can't remember their last kiss. Derek recalls the kiss for her, telling her that she ``smelled like some kind of flower,'' which Meredith says was lavender, and then he leaves.

Context: Also, in ``The Sister'', Mark asked Lucas if he would remarry. Lucas replied that it was ``only natural'' for him to consider a second marriage. Mark asked when Lucas might marry again. He reassured Mark: ``When I find the right woman.'' Mark asked what the qualifications would entail. Lucas told Mark that he would know the right woman ``when I meet her son.'' With a big grin on his face, Mark asked, ``What will she be like?'' Lucas replied, ``Well, she'll have to cook and sew and scrub. Her hands gotta be soft, she's gotta have hair like the crimson as the setting sun. Eyes as brown as chestnuts. She's gotta wear a flower because that's womanly. Ride a horse like a man.''

Context: In humans, pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli. Whether animals apart from humans also experience pain is often contentious despite being scientifically verifiable. The standard measure of pain in humans is how a person reports that pain, (for example, on a pain scale). ``Pain'' is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as ``an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.'' Only the person experiencing the pain can know the pain's quality and intensity, and the degree of suffering. However, for non-human animals, it is harder, if even possible, to know whether an emotional experience has occurred. Therefore, this concept is often excluded in definitions of pain in animals, such as that provided by Zimmerman: ``an aversive sensory experience caused by actual or potential injury that elicits protective motor and vegetative reactions, results in learned avoidance and may modify species-specific behaviour, including social behaviour.'' Non-human animals cannot report their feelings to language-using humans in the same manner as human communication, but observation of their behaviour provides a reasonable indication as to the extent of their pain. Just as with doctors and medics who sometimes share no common language with their patients, the indicators of pain can still be understood.

Context: The show went on, and FYI featured several changes in on- and off-camera staff: Peter Hunt, McGovern and Miller Redfield temporarily joined the regulars at the anchor desk. The network moved FYI to a new studio with a trendy exterior ``Window on America''. A significant story-arc saw the network squelch an FYI exposé on the tobacco industry, leading to the resignation of first Dial, then the remainder of the cast. They all went to work reorganizing the poorly-performing news division of a fledgling network. In the end, Miles faced down the network; the ``suits'' relented, the staffers returned and the story aired. For his courage in standing up to the network brass, Miles was promoted to the news division's headquarters in New York--to the detriment of his new marriage to Corky.

Context: In the twelfth season, Stephanie must help a patient recover from brain surgery, which brings back bad memories from her childhood of when she was a sickle-cell experiment participant. Jo accuses Stephanie of lying about her disease, and tries to get Stephanie in trouble with Amelia. Stephanie confronts Jo at Meredith's party after Jo gives a misguided apology, saying she can't take the fact that she is better than her at the job and tells her to deal with her shortcomings, as Jo used her sick past as a ``reason'' for her hyper-competence. Jo is left speechless by this. Stephanie later deals with a group of cheerleaders in the hospital. A patient named Kyle comes into the hospital and begins flirting with Stephanie. They eventually become a couple. Meredith teases Stephanie about her new love interest, Kyle, after Stephanie accidentally sends Meredith an explicit text meant for him. Stephanie is kicked off Kyle's case when Amelia finds out that they're a couple. Not being able to operate leads to her breaking up with him. She thinks breaking up with Kyle was a mistake and almost calls him while drunk. Later, she learns Kyle is back in the hospital with suspected meningitis, chose not to tell her and angrily refuses to let her be involved. Stephanie and Kyle reconcile, right before Amelia is unable to save his life in surgery.

Context: Melody Brooks is an eleven-year-old girl who was born with Cerebral Palsy. Her parents have done everything they can to help her live a normal life, but life is often frustrating for Melody since she cannot speak, move, or communicate her wishes. As a result, Melody has to fight to get her wishes. At age five, Melody is even diagnosed as profoundly retarded. Despite this, Melody's mom enrolls her in Spaulding Street Elementary school to get the education she needs. However, the class she is put in is like a baby class, learning the same things every day. Melody is frustrated by this. Her neighbor, Mrs. V., is a kind, but tough woman. She pushes Melody to do the best she can. When Melody was three, Mrs. V. wasn't impressed for Melody to rely on her parents for everything. Because of this, Mrs. V. forced her to learn how to crawl and roll on the ground. She even taught Melody how to catch herself whenever she fell from her wheelchair. These things helped Melody become self-sufficient, but she continues to be reliant on her parents to help feed her and help her go to the bathroom. When Melody turns eight, her mother becomes pregnant. During this time, Melody overhears them talking about the new baby and their fears that it will suffer the same disabilities. Melody feels ashamed when she hears this. However, Melody is happy when the baby, Penny, is born perfectly healthy. Melody feels jealous as Penny grows and matures since she'll never be able to do the things Penny can do. However, Melody loves her little sister, and the pleasures Melody brings to her parents. When Melody enters fifth grade, she gets a communication device that allows her to talk with other people. At school, her new teacher starts an inclusion program that allows the special needs students to participate in the standard classes. Melody also gets an aide, Catherine, to help her. Melody befriends Rose Spencer, but is bullied by Molly and Claire, who believe that Melody's disability makes her dumber than them. Even her teacher, Mr. Dimming, believes that Melody cannot participate, but is surprised that not only does Melody join, but passes a test exam of a trivia competition with a perfect score. When he tells his class that if Melody can ace it, he is giving way too easy questions, Melody works with Ms. V in order to win the real tryouts, which she does so with a perfect score. Melody then helps the team win the qualifying competition to earn a trip to Washington D.C. for the national competition. However, on the day the group is to fly to Washington, Melody learns that her flight has been canceled due to weather, but that the rest of the team has made an earlier flight without her. Melody insists the day after the fiasco on going to school, but her mom's dismal attitude causes her to accidentally run over Penny despite Melody's attempts to warn her mother. Melody blames herself for not being able to inform her mom, even though everyone, especially Mrs. V., tells her it's not her fault. Although Melody is terrified that Penny will have a brain injury like her and be like her, she learns that Penny is going to be okay, and just has a cast on her leg. On Monday, Melody's class also apologizes for their lack of being considerate towards her by giving her their ninth place trophy, hoping to reconcile with her. However, Melody just's laughs at them and destroys the trophy by accident and says ``no you take it'' and heads out of the room. The next day, she and Catherine begin work on Melody's autobiography, which begins with the first few lines of the book.

Dr. Bailey's husband goes into cardiac arrest. Meredith finally removes the explosive from the patient, and Dylan, the leader of the bomb squad, carries it away. Meredith steps out of the operating room into the hallway, curiously watching Dylan walk away with the explosive, and at that moment, the bomb explodes, killing Dylan and a second bomb squad member. Meredith is knocked unconscious by the explosion. There is a revival of the ``shower scene'' from the first part, but with a more serious tone: the fully clothed Izzie and Cristina wash blood off of a stunned Meredith as George looks on. Dr. Bailey's husband and the man who had the explosive embedded in his body both survive. At the end of the episode, Preston and Derek become friends, overcoming their initial rivalry in the series beginning, and call each other by their first names. Cristina says ``I love you, too'' to a sleeping Preston. Derek comes to visit Meredith and says, ``You almost died today,'' and Meredith tells him that she can't remember their last kiss. Derek recalls the kiss for her, telling her that she ``smelled like some kind of flower,'' which Meredith says was lavender, and then he leaves.

Context: Budd, a.k.a. Sidewinder (portrayed by Michael Madsen), is Bill's degenerate younger brother who was recognized by Bill as 'the only man (he) ever loved', an epigraph etched onto Budd's sword. He was the only other male Deadly Viper Squad member and, since the assassination squad's disbandment, adopted a redneck-like lifestyle. Living in a mobile home where he steadily became an alcoholic, Budd makes ends meet by working as a bouncer at a local strip club. When told by Bill that Beatrix was coming to kill him, Budd philosophically stated ``That woman deserves her revenge. And we deserve to die. But then again, so does she.'' (When Budd makes this statement in Volume 1, the last sentence is not included; the full statement is spoken in Volume 2). Budd once owned a Hattori Hanzo katana and told Bill, who told Elle, that he had sold it for $250 in El Paso, Texas. He actually lied because The Bride later found the sword in a golf bag in the bedroom of Budd's trailer. During Bill and Budd's discourse, Bill mentions an unpleasant event between the two of them that led to their falling out, but the details of this event are never explicitly mentioned.

Context: A contestant spins the wheel to determine a dollar value and guess a consonant. Calling a correct letter earns the value before the corresponding flipper, multiplied by the number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle. Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money to keep doing so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.

Context: The Montgomery Bus Boycott was a political and social protest campaign against the policy of racial segregation on the public transit system of Montgomery, Alabama. It was a seminal event in the Civil Rights Movement. The campaign lasted from December 5, 1955--the Monday after Rosa Parks, an African American woman, was arrested for refusing to surrender her seat to a white person--to December 20, 1956, when a federal ruling, Browder v. Gayle, took effect, and led to a United States Supreme Court decision that declared the Alabama and Montgomery laws that segregated buses were unconstitutional. Many important figures in the Civil Rights Movement took part in the boycott, including Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. and Ralph Abernathy.

Context: At the beginning of season 5, Sam and Addison are back together, although they break up again as he is still not ready to commit to marriage and a family with her. Jake is hired at the practice, which at first makes Addison uncomfortable. Jake is a very gifted doctor whose speciality is helping women with fertility issues become pregnant. He becomes Addison's doctor and helps her attempt to conceive using IVF. Throughout the season, Addison and Jake grow closer. It is revealed that Jake had a wife, Lily, who was a drug addict and died from an overdose. He adopted her daughter Angela, who is featured in the final 2 seasons of the show. She is often shown advising her father and encourages him to pursue a relationship with Addison, whom he clearly has feelings for. Although Addison still has feelings for Sam, she also has feelings for Jake, the latter of whom wants to get married and have kids. On more than one occasion, Addison and Jake kiss, and both admit to have feelings for the other. However, Jake realizes that Addison is not over Sam and does not want to be a rebound, but tells her he will wait for her. Although Addison decides to stop fertility treatments, her dream of having a child finally comes true and she adopts a baby boy named Henry. Sam begins to regret his decision to leave Addison, and makes excuses to spend time with Henry, but Addison decides to focus on her baby instead of pursuing a relationship with either Sam or Jake. In the season finale, Addison and Jake have sex after Amelia delivers a brainless baby whose organs she donates so that her pregnancy will still be meaningful. When Addison arrives home, Sam is there with Henry and he proposes to Addison. It is not revealed what she says, but we also see that Jake is on his way to her house with flowers and Chinese food.

Context: In humans, pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli. Whether animals apart from humans also experience pain is often contentious despite being scientifically verifiable. The standard measure of pain in humans is how a person reports that pain, (for example, on a pain scale). ``Pain'' is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as ``an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.'' Only the person experiencing the pain can know the pain's quality and intensity, and the degree of suffering. However, for non-human animals, it is harder, if even possible, to know whether an emotional experience has occurred. Therefore, this concept is often excluded in definitions of pain in animals, such as that provided by Zimmerman: ``an aversive sensory experience caused by actual or potential injury that elicits protective motor and vegetative reactions, results in learned avoidance and may modify species-specific behaviour, including social behaviour.'' Non-human animals cannot report their feelings to language-using humans in the same manner as human communication, but observation of their behaviour provides a reasonable indication as to the extent of their pain. Just as with doctors and medics who sometimes share no common language with their patients, the indicators of pain can still be understood. 
 Question:do animals feel pain the same as humans

Context: A drinking establishment is a business whose primary function is the serving of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. Some establishments may also serve food, or have entertainment, but their main purpose is to serve alcoholic beverages. There are different types of drinking establishment ranging from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed ``dive bars'', to 5,000 seat beer halls and elegant places of entertainment for the elite. A public house, informally known as a ``pub'', is an establishment licensed to serve alcoholic drinks for consumption on the premises in countries and regions of British influence. Although the terms are increasingly used to refer to the same thing, there is a difference between pubs, bars, inns, taverns and lounges where alcohol is served commercially. A tavern or pot-house is, loosely, a place of business where people gather to drink alcoholic beverages and, more than likely, also be served food, though not licensed to put up guests. The word derives from the Latin taberna and the Greek ταβέρνα/taverna.

Context: There is no generally agreed definition of ``business casual''. One definition of business casual states that it includes khaki pants, slacks, and skirts, as well as short-sleeved polo shirts and long-sleeved shirts, but excludes jeans, tennis shoes, tight or short skirts, T-shirts, and sweatshirts. Another source, an American university careers service, states that business casual consists of neutral colors more towards the dark shades of black, gray, navy, but can include white and off white, and reminds that the clothing should be pressed and have clean, crisp seams. The ``Dress for Success'' advice from the University of Toronto sums up business casual as ``a classic, clean cut, and put together look where a full suit is not required,'' which means slacks, khakis, or skirts; blouses, polo shirts, or shirts with collar but no necktie; some sweaters; and closed-toe shoes. The Canadian university ends with the warning that ``it is not clothing you would wear to a club or for athletic purposes... Don't let the word casual mislead you. You still need to look professional.''

Context: At the beginning of season 5, Sam and Addison are back together, although they break up again as he is still not ready to commit to marriage and a family with her. Jake is hired at the practice, which at first makes Addison uncomfortable. Jake is a very gifted doctor whose speciality is helping women with fertility issues become pregnant. He becomes Addison's doctor and helps her attempt to conceive using IVF. Throughout the season, Addison and Jake grow closer. It is revealed that Jake had a wife, Lily, who was a drug addict and died from an overdose. He adopted her daughter Angela, who is featured in the final 2 seasons of the show. She is often shown advising her father and encourages him to pursue a relationship with Addison, whom he clearly has feelings for. Although Addison still has feelings for Sam, she also has feelings for Jake, the latter of whom wants to get married and have kids. On more than one occasion, Addison and Jake kiss, and both admit to have feelings for the other. However, Jake realizes that Addison is not over Sam and does not want to be a rebound, but tells her he will wait for her. Although Addison decides to stop fertility treatments, her dream of having a child finally comes true and she adopts a baby boy named Henry. Sam begins to regret his decision to leave Addison, and makes excuses to spend time with Henry, but Addison decides to focus on her baby instead of pursuing a relationship with either Sam or Jake. In the season finale, Addison and Jake have sex after Amelia delivers a brainless baby whose organs she donates so that her pregnancy will still be meaningful. When Addison arrives home, Sam is there with Henry and he proposes to Addison. It is not revealed what she says, but we also see that Jake is on his way to her house with flowers and Chinese food.

Context: Mary Ellen (Judy Norton Taylor) is the oldest of Liv and John's daughters, born in April 1920, aged 13 in season one. Throughout the first few seasons, she is a typically whiny, sometimes rebellious teenager, somewhat of a tomboy who enjoys playing baseball, but could also be vain, engaging in a rivalry with rich-girl Martha-Rose Coverdale for the affections of the awkward G.W. Haines (David Doremus). Mary Ellen matures into a wiser young woman and her childish fantasy of becoming a movie star gives way for a more reasonable and realistic ambition to go into medicine after reading up on it and developing an interest. She then works to gain an education as a medical worker, and becomes a nurse. However, when she ends up taking care of the people out in the country by herself, she concludes they need more medical expertise than she can offer them and continues studying medicine until she succeeds in becoming a fully-fledged doctor. Even though some people frown upon female doctors and she receives mixed support from her family, she refuses to let this stop her. Mary Ellen has a special relationship with each of her six siblings, but she is especially close to her younger sister Erin. Mary Ellen and Erin fought a lot when they were younger girls, particularly in seasons 1 and 2. But in the middle seasons, Mary Ellen and Erin matured and became friends. In season 5 after Mary Ellen married Curt, her relationship with her sister deepened even further and by the end of the show, they truly did become each other's best friend.

Context: Blue the dog (portrayed by Traci Paige Johnson) is the main protagonist of the Blue's Clues television series. She is a playful, smart, energetic, and friendly little blue-spotted puppy who enjoys doing fun things with her friends. She is owned by Steve (later Joe). She expresses this by leaving clues around the house so everyone can guess what she wants to do. Her basic mark for leaving clues is her blue pawprint. Blue likes to eat sandwiches and drink milk. She also possesses many other human characteristics. Every episode she initiates a game of Blue's Clues in which she leaves three blue paw print clues for Steve and the viewer to find in order to answer a question. Though Blue cannot speak like most of the characters, she seems to be able to communicate with others through barking. In Blue's First Holiday, it is revealed that Blue played her first game of Blue's Clues trying to find Joe's duck blanket. Blue is high-spirited and believes in making people find things out by themselves instead of being told an answer automatically. Blue was born on a farm with many other puppies. Blue is affectionate, friendly, compassionate, and playful. She can be shy and sometimes mischievous. When she can't explain something by her usual ``bow-bow'', she makes people find out for themselves, by playing Blue's Clues. Blue's Clues is her favorite game and is always ready to play it. Blue is very sensitive and intelligent, and she can get mad or sad whenever someone does not do what she intended them to do. Fortunately, she doesn't bite when upset, as she is very friendly. She also appears in the spin-off Blue's Room, where she can talk. She first appears in an aired pilot Snack Time though she also appeared in the unaired pilot Blue Prints. Her last appearance in a Blue's Clues episode was in Bluestock. Her first appearance in a Blue's Room episode was in Snacktime Playdate and her final appearance in the series was in Music Stars

Context: Dr. Bailey is in labor, and without her husband Tucker Jones by her side, she refuses to push so she can give birth. George works with Addison to convince Bailey to have the baby. He finally gets through to Bailey by giving her the motivation that she needs, and ultimately he holds her while she delivers the baby. Izzie and Alex have sex again. Chief Richard Webber is under a lot of stress from everything that's been going on, and it is believed that he is having a heart attack, which lures his wife Adele to the hospital. However, it proves to be just an anxiety attack. Dr. Bailey's husband goes into cardiac arrest. Meredith finally removes the explosive from the patient, and Dylan, the leader of the bomb squad, carries it away. Meredith steps out of the operating room into the hallway, curiously watching Dylan walk away with the explosive, and at that moment, the bomb explodes, killing Dylan and a second bomb squad member. Meredith is knocked unconscious by the explosion. There is a revival of the ``shower scene'' from the first part, but with a more serious tone: the fully clothed Izzie and Cristina wash blood off of a stunned Meredith as George looks on. Dr. Bailey's husband and the man who had the explosive embedded in his body both survive. At the end of the episode, Preston and Derek become friends, overcoming their initial rivalry in the series beginning, and call each other by their first names. Cristina says ``I love you, too'' to a sleeping Preston. Derek comes to visit Meredith and says, ``You almost died today,'' and Meredith tells him that she can't remember their last kiss. Derek recalls the kiss for her, telling her that she ``smelled like some kind of flower,'' which Meredith says was lavender, and then he leaves.

Context: Betty goes to Bobby's summer camp for a family weekend in ``The Better Half'', driving down without Henry. Don, also on his way to the camp, sees the newly svelte Betty lost at a gas station, and they go down to the campground together. They spend the afternoon with Bobby, and everyone has a wonderful time. That night Don visits Betty's cabin, and they share a drink, reminiscing about the early years of their marriage and the kids. Don accepts Betty's tacit invitation to enter her cabin, and they make love. Betty and Don talk afterward, and Betty admits that she's happy with Henry, is no longer as mad at Don as she once was, and feels sorry for Megan, who doesn't know that loving Don is the worst way of getting to him. The next morning Don wakes up alone and goes down to the cafeteria, where he sees Betty and Henry eating together. Don says hello to them and goes off to eat, alone, at the other side of the room.

Context: Dr. Bailey is in labor, and without her husband Tucker Jones by her side, she refuses to push so she can give birth. George works with Addison to convince Bailey to have the baby. He finally gets through to Bailey by giving her the motivation that she needs, and ultimately he holds her while she delivers the baby. Izzie and Alex have sex again. Chief Richard Webber is under a lot of stress from everything that's been going on, and it is believed that he is having a heart attack, which lures his wife Adele to the hospital. However, it proves to be just an anxiety attack. Dr. Bailey's husband goes into cardiac arrest. Meredith finally removes the explosive from the patient, and Dylan, the leader of the bomb squad, carries it away. Meredith steps out of the operating room into the hallway, curiously watching Dylan walk away with the explosive, and at that moment, the bomb explodes, killing Dylan and a second bomb squad member. Meredith is knocked unconscious by the explosion. There is a revival of the ``shower scene'' from the first part, but with a more serious tone: the fully clothed Izzie and Cristina wash blood off of a stunned Meredith as George looks on. Dr. Bailey's husband and the man who had the explosive embedded in his body both survive. At the end of the episode, Preston and Derek become friends, overcoming their initial rivalry in the series beginning, and call each other by their first names. Cristina says ``I love you, too'' to a sleeping Preston. Derek comes to visit Meredith and says, ``You almost died today,'' and Meredith tells him that she can't remember their last kiss. Derek recalls the kiss for her, telling her that she ``smelled like some kind of flower,'' which Meredith says was lavender, and then he leaves.

Context: Melody Brooks is an eleven-year-old girl who was born with Cerebral Palsy. Her parents have done everything they can to help her live a normal life, but life is often frustrating for Melody since she cannot speak, move, or communicate her wishes. As a result, Melody has to fight to get her wishes. At age five, Melody is even diagnosed as profoundly retarded. Despite this, Melody's mom enrolls her in Spaulding Street Elementary school to get the education she needs. However, the class she is put in is like a baby class, learning the same things every day. Melody is frustrated by this. Her neighbor, Mrs. V., is a kind, but tough woman. She pushes Melody to do the best she can. When Melody was three, Mrs. V. wasn't impressed for Melody to rely on her parents for everything. Because of this, Mrs. V. forced her to learn how to crawl and roll on the ground. She even taught Melody how to catch herself whenever she fell from her wheelchair. These things helped Melody become self-sufficient, but she continues to be reliant on her parents to help feed her and help her go to the bathroom. When Melody turns eight, her mother becomes pregnant. During this time, Melody overhears them talking about the new baby and their fears that it will suffer the same disabilities. Melody feels ashamed when she hears this. However, Melody is happy when the baby, Penny, is born perfectly healthy. Melody feels jealous as Penny grows and matures since she'll never be able to do the things Penny can do. However, Melody loves her little sister, and the pleasures Melody brings to her parents. When Melody enters fifth grade, she gets a communication device that allows her to talk with other people. At school, her new teacher starts an inclusion program that allows the special needs students to participate in the standard classes. Melody also gets an aide, Catherine, to help her. Melody befriends Rose Spencer, but is bullied by Molly and Claire, who believe that Melody's disability makes her dumber than them. Even her teacher, Mr. Dimming, believes that Melody cannot participate, but is surprised that not only does Melody join, but passes a test exam of a trivia competition with a perfect score. When he tells his class that if Melody can ace it, he is giving way too easy questions, Melody works with Ms. V in order to win the real tryouts, which she does so with a perfect score. Melody then helps the team win the qualifying competition to earn a trip to Washington D.C. for the national competition. However, on the day the group is to fly to Washington, Melody learns that her flight has been canceled due to weather, but that the rest of the team has made an earlier flight without her. Melody insists the day after the fiasco on going to school, but her mom's dismal attitude causes her to accidentally run over Penny despite Melody's attempts to warn her mother. Melody blames herself for not being able to inform her mom, even though everyone, especially Mrs. V., tells her it's not her fault. Although Melody is terrified that Penny will have a brain injury like her and be like her, she learns that Penny is going to be okay, and just has a cast on her leg. On Monday, Melody's class also apologizes for their lack of being considerate towards her by giving her their ninth place trophy, hoping to reconcile with her. However, Melody just's laughs at them and destroys the trophy by accident and says ``no you take it'' and heads out of the room. The next day, she and Catherine begin work on Melody's autobiography, which begins with the first few lines of the book.

Context: Dr. Bailey is in labor, and without her husband Tucker Jones by her side, she refuses to push so she can give birth. George works with Addison to convince Bailey to have the baby. He finally gets through to Bailey by giving her the motivation that she needs, and ultimately he holds her while she delivers the baby. Izzie and Alex have sex again. Chief Richard Webber is under a lot of stress from everything that's been going on, and it is believed that he is having a heart attack, which lures his wife Adele to the hospital. However, it proves to be just an anxiety attack. Dr. Bailey's husband goes into cardiac arrest. Meredith finally removes the explosive from the patient, and Dylan, the leader of the bomb squad, carries it away. Meredith steps out of the operating room into the hallway, curiously watching Dylan walk away with the explosive, and at that moment, the bomb explodes, killing Dylan and a second bomb squad member. Meredith is knocked unconscious by the explosion. There is a revival of the ``shower scene'' from the first part, but with a more serious tone: the fully clothed Izzie and Cristina wash blood off of a stunned Meredith as George looks on. Dr. Bailey's husband and the man who had the explosive embedded in his body both survive. At the end of the episode, Preston and Derek become friends, overcoming their initial rivalry in the series beginning, and call each other by their first names. Cristina says ``I love you, too'' to a sleeping Preston. Derek comes to visit Meredith and says, ``You almost died today,'' and Meredith tells him that she can't remember their last kiss. Derek recalls the kiss for her, telling her that she ``smelled like some kind of flower,'' which Meredith says was lavender, and then he leaves.

Context: Later Liz realizes that she now has a power: to see the future. When she touches Max she has visions that she, Max, Isabel, and Michael are going to die. Michael says that Max, Liz and Isabel should leave Roswell separately because the FBI knows who they are and their life in Roswell has to be over. Maria is upset by this because she doesn't want to be left in Roswell alone without Michael or Liz. Max proposes to Liz, making the choice to be with her even if they have only 12 days. Liz says yes. They all attend their graduation and when they realize this is where they are supposed to die from one of Liz's flashes they all escape into the desert. Now Max, Liz, Michael, Maria, Isabel and Kyle decide to leave together because even though Maria and Kyle were not going to be killed, Kyle wants to be with his own kind when he develops his alien powers from Max's healing and Maria wants to be with Michael. They leave Roswell that night, and go together in a van, deciding to live life using their powers to do good deeds on the road. Liz sends her father her journal, continuing the truth about everything so he can understand why she left and finally know what has been going on in her life. Liz marries Max in a beautiful country church.

Context: For a person standing in an elevator either stationary or moving at constant velocity, the normal force on the person's feet balances the person's weight. In an elevator that is accelerating upward, the normal force is greater than the person's ground weight and so the person's perceived weight increases (making the person feel heavier). In an elevator that is accelerating downward, the normal force is less than the person's ground weight and so a passenger's perceived weight decreases. If a passenger were to stand on a weighing scale, such as a conventional bathroom scale, while riding the elevator, the scale will be reading the normal force it delivers to the passenger's feet, and will be different than the person's ground weight if the elevator cab is accelerating up or down. The weighing scale measures normal force (which varies as the elevator cab accelerates), not gravitational force (which does not vary as the cab accelerates). 
 Question:is weight always equal to the normal force

Context: Quinn along with the New Directions alumni return in the episode ``Homecoming'' to help Rachel and Kurt rebuild the New Directions. Quinn, Santana, and Brittany attempt to recruit new members by performing in Cheerios Alumni outfits, but only recruit twins Mason and Madison when former Glee new member, Kitty, who was the only member not to be transferred as Sue saw her as a star player, announced she wouldn't return because of the way Artie treated her and everyone else when he left. Puck is still her boyfriend. She appears in ``Jagged Little Tapestry'' along with Tina to help Becky convince her new boyfriend that she is in every club of the school. Quinn, Tina, Sue, and Coach Roz get a huge surprise when they find out that Becky's boyfriend, Darrell, does not have Down syndrome like Becky does.

She is mentioned several times during the Pilot's parallel episode ``2009'', as Finn's cheerleader girlfriend. She is later seen during Don't Stop Believin' watching the performance with Sue and Santana.

Context: In each season, eight drivers and their nominators-- Canada's Worst Driver 11 had nine drivers; more on this later-- are enrolled at the Driver Rehabilitation Centre where they compete in challenges designed to improve their driving skills, in an effort to not be named Canada's Worst Driver. In the first challenge, the contestants begin at a location about an hour's drive from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. Following the directions that are given, each contestant must drive to the Driver Rehabilitation Centre where, upon arriving, the driver's license of each contestant is confiscated (for the first two seasons, their car keys were confiscated instead). The first episode concludes with an obstacle course or assessment challenge, meant to evaluate the skills of each driver. The series is well known for its obstacle course challenges. Contestants must routinely maneuver their cars through tight spaces with less than an inch of clearance on either side. To show that the challenge can be done without hitting obstacles by an average driver, host Andrew Younghusband, himself an average driver, performs each challenge before any contestant attempts said challenge. At the end of each episode, starting with the second episode of each season, each contestant meets with Andrew and a panel of four experts for an evaluation of his or her performance. After all remaining contestants are interviewed, the experts and Andrew deliberate on which contestant and nominator pair have improved enough to graduate from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. The driver who has graduated is eliminated from the competition and is sent home with his or her license returned to him or her. Typically, the contestants drive off with their nominators in the car that they used to arrive at the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. During the series, the experts also reserve the right to not graduate anyone during an episode or to graduate multiple contestants at the same time. The experts may also choose to expel any contestant prematurely who does not show any incentive to learn, who they believe should not continue driving or who can not continue the rehabilitation program often for medical or legal reasons. In this particular instance, certain contestants are eliminated from the competition and their licenses are returned and they are given a ride home by their nominators. However, a prematurely expelled contestant or contestant who refuses to continue may still be considered for the title, as was the case in Canada's Worst Driver Ever, in which Dale Pitton was expelled in the second-to-last episode, only to be brought back for the trophy presentation. In extreme cases, the experts may contact the relevant Ministry of Transport and request that a driver's license be put up for review, if they believe that a contestant is medically unfit to continue driving. To date, this has happened only twice, in Canada's Worst Driver 4 with Donna Hicks and Canada's Worst Driver Ever with Dale. The elimination process continues until only three contestants remain (the original intent was for two contestants to remain, but due to the first season containing an episode in which no one graduated, there were three; every subsequent season has had three finalists). Those three finalists are then given the final challenge, which is typically a three-in-a-car forward-backward slalom within a certain time limit, followed by the Mega Challenge, an obstacle course with elements of almost every previous challenge (the standard transmission balancing challenge, among others, is not part of the Mega Challenge, but every challenge that is practical to include does get included), as well as a driving examination through the busy streets of a major urban centre in Canada near the Driver Rehabilitation Centre (since season seven, the road test has been in Hamilton, Ontario). Based on these three challenges, the experts determine which among the three is Canada's Worst Driver. With the exception of the eighth season, in which both Kevin Simmons and Flora Wang were named Canada's Worst Driver, the contestant who fared the second-worst is deemed to not have graduated from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre, while the contestant who fared the third-worst is considered a graduate (with the exception of the eleventh season, in which, despite faring the third-worst, Sholom Hoffman failed to graduate). Unlike other versions of the Worst Driver series around the world, where being eliminated early is rewarded with a new car while the Worst Driver has their car destroyed, Canada's Worst Driver awards no prizes aside from a trophy for being named the worst, as the point of the show is to educate rather than entertain.

Context: Dr. Bailey is in labor, and without her husband Tucker Jones by her side, she refuses to push so she can give birth. George works with Addison to convince Bailey to have the baby. He finally gets through to Bailey by giving her the motivation that she needs, and ultimately he holds her while she delivers the baby. Izzie and Alex have sex again. Chief Richard Webber is under a lot of stress from everything that's been going on, and it is believed that he is having a heart attack, which lures his wife Adele to the hospita(anxiety attack)). Dr. Bailey's husband goes into cardiac arrest. Meredith finally removes the explosive from the patient, and Dylan, the leader of the bomb squad, carries it away. Meredith steps out of the operating room into the hallway, curiously watching Dylan walk away with the explosive, and at that moment, the bomb explodes, killing Dylan and a second bomb squad member. Meredith is knocked unconscious by the explosion. There is a revival of the ``shower scene'' from the first part, but with a more serious tone: the fully clothed Izzie and Cristina wash blood off of a stunned Meredith as George looks on. Dr. Bailey's husband and the man who had the explosive embedded in his body both survive. At the end of the episode, Preston and Derek become friends, overcoming their initial rivalry in the series beginning, and call each other by their first names. Cristina says ``I love you, too'' to a sleeping Preston. Derek comes to visit Meredith and says, ``You almost died today,'' and Meredith tells him that she can't remember their last kiss. Derek recalls the kiss for her, telling her that she ``smelled like some kind of flower,'' which Meredith says was lavender, and then he leaves.

Context: Jan is seen again in the fourth-season finale, in which she is revealed to be pregnant via artificial insemination. Michael goes to her Lamaze classes when Jan asks him to (where he apparently annoyed the teacher) and is incredibly excited to be there for the birth of ``their'' child. However, he is utterly deflated when Jan gives birth to her daughter Astrid without him there, and when Jan reluctantly lets Michael spend time around her, Michael sadly recognizes that he feels no connection at all to Astrid and that he is no longer holding onto feelings for Jan. Jan also insists Michael not go out with Holly, leading Michael to promptly and successfully ask Holly out on a date.

Stephanie confronts Jo at Meredith's party after Jo gives a misguided apology, saying she can't take the fact that she is better than her at the job and tells her to deal with her shortcomings, as Jo used her sick past as a ``reason'' for her hyper-competence.

Jake is hired at the practice, which at first makes Addison uncomfortable. Jake is a very gifted doctor whose speciality is helping women with fertility issues become pregnant. He becomes Addison's doctor and helps her attempt to conceive using IVF. Throughout the season, Addison and Jake grow closer. It is revealed that Jake had a wife, Lily, who was a drug addict and died from an overdose. He adopted her daughter Angela, who is featured in the final 2 seasons of the show. She is often shown advising her father and encourages him to pursue a relationship with Addison, whom he clearly has feelings for. Although Addison still has feelings for Sam, she also has feelings for Jake, the latter of whom wants to get married and have kids. On more than one occasion, Addison and Jake kiss, and both admit to have feelings for the other. However, Jake realizes that Addison is not over Sam and does not want to be a rebound, but tells her he will wait for her. Although Addison decides to stop fertility treatments, her dream of having a child finally comes true and she adopts a baby boy named Henry. Sam begins to regret his decision to leave Addison, and makes excuses to spend time with Henry, but Addison decides to focus on her baby instead of pursuing a relationship with either Sam or Jake. In the season finale, Addison and Jake have sex after Amelia delivers a brainless baby whose organs she donates so that her pregnancy will still be meaningful. When Addison arrives home, Sam is there with Henry and he proposes to Addison. It is not revealed what she says, but we also see that Jake is on his way to her house with flowers and Chinese food.

Context: In each season, eight drivers and their nominators-- Canada's Worst Driver 11 had nine drivers; more on this later-- are enrolled at the Driver Rehabilitation Centre where they compete in challenges designed to improve their driving skills, in an effort to not be named Canada's Worst Driver. In the first challenge, the contestants begin at a location about an hour's drive from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. Following the directions that are given, each contestant must drive to the Driver Rehabilitation Centre where, upon arriving, the driver's license of each contestant is confiscated (for the first two seasons, their car keys were confiscated instead). The first episode concludes with an obstacle course or assessment challenge, meant to evaluate the skills of each driver. The series is well known for its obstacle course challenges. Contestants must routinely maneuver their cars through tight spaces with less than an inch of clearance on either side. To show that the challenge can be done without hitting obstacles by an average driver, host Andrew Younghusband, himself an average driver, performs each challenge before any contestant attempts said challenge. At the end of each episode, starting with the second episode of each season, each contestant meets with Andrew and a panel of four experts for an evaluation of his or her performance. After all remaining contestants are interviewed, the experts and Andrew deliberate on which contestant and nominator pair have improved enough to graduate from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. The driver who has graduated is eliminated from the competition and is sent home with his or her license returned to him or her. Typically, the contestants drive off with their nominators in the car that they used to arrive at the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. During the series, the experts also reserve the right to not graduate anyone during an episode or to graduate multiple contestants at the same time. The experts may also choose to expel any contestant prematurely who does not show any incentive to learn, who they believe should not continue driving or who can not continue the rehabilitation program often for medical or legal reasons. In this particular instance, certain contestants are eliminated from the competition and their licenses are returned and they are given a ride home by their nominators. However, a prematurely expelled contestant or contestant who refuses to continue may still be considered for the title, as was the case in Canada's Worst Driver Ever, in which Dale Pitton was expelled in the second-to-last episode, only to be brought back for the trophy presentation. In extreme cases, the experts may contact the relevant Ministry of Transport and request that a driver's license be put up for review, if they believe that a contestant is medically unfit to continue driving. To date, this has happened only twice, in Canada's Worst Driver 4 with Donna Hicks and Canada's Worst Driver Ever with Dale. The elimination process continues until only three contestants remain (the original intent was for two contestants to remain, but due to the first season containing an episode in which no one graduated, there were three; every subsequent season has had three finalists). Those three finalists are then given the final challenge, which is typically a three-in-a-car forward-backward slalom within a certain time limit, followed by the Mega Challenge, an obstacle course with elements of almost every previous challenge (the standard transmission balancing challenge, among others, is not part of the Mega Challenge, but every challenge that is practical to include does get included), as well as a driving examination through the busy streets of a major urban centre in Canada near the Driver Rehabilitation Centre (since season seven, the road test has been in Hamilton, Ontario). Based on these three challenges, the experts determine which among the three is Canada's Worst Driver. With the exception of the eighth season, in which both Kevin Simmons and Flora Wang were named Canada's Worst Driver, the contestant who fared the second-worst is deemed to not have graduated from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre, while the contestant who fared the third-worst is considered a graduate (with the exception of the eleventh season, in which, despite faring the third-worst, Sholom Hoffman failed to graduate). Unlike other versions of the Worst Driver series around the world, where being eliminated early is rewarded with a new car while the Worst Driver has their car destroyed, Canada's Worst Driver awards no prizes aside from a trophy for being named the worst, as the point of the show is to educate rather than entertain.

Context: When Robbins wins a prestigious grant to help treat children in Malawi, a disgruntled Torres agrees to move there with her, as the position will last for three years; however, her lack of enthusiasm causes Robbins to end their relationship and go without her. A heartbroken Torres moves in with Sloan, and they have a one-night stand. Robbins returns for Torres, apologizing and hoping for forgiveness, but Torres initially rebuffs her, and later reveals that she is pregnant with Sloan's baby. Robbins agrees to raise the child with her, but dislikes that Sloan will be a permanent part of their lives. En route a weekend getaway, Robbins proposes to Torres, but before Torres can reply, the two are in a head-on collision with a truck, leaving Torres severely injured. In an attempt to save her life, obstetrician-gynecologist Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), delivers Torres's premature baby. Torres survives, and agrees to marry Robbins. After twelve weeks of recovery, both Torres and baby Sofia are discharged and allowed to leave the hospital. Torres recovers from her surgery, but deals with the backlash from her mother (Gina Gallego)'s attitude toward the wedding and her granddaughter. Torres and Robbins marry in a garden after the minister's wife falls ill, with general surgeon Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), officiating the ceremony.

Context: The 1933 Chesapeake--Potomac hurricane was among the most damaging hurricanes in the Mid-Atlantic states in the eastern United States. The sixth storm and third hurricane of the very active 1933 Atlantic hurricane season, it formed in the eastern Atlantic, where it moved west-northwestward and eventually became a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. A strong ridge over New England allowed a continued northwest course, bringing the storm south of Bermuda and later toward the middle coast of the eastern United States. Advance warning allowed hundreds of people to evacuate ahead of the hurricane making landfall. It did so in northeastern North Carolina on August 23 with winds of about 90 mph (150 km/h). Soon after, the eye crossed over Norfolk, Virginia, the first time that happened since 1821. The hurricane weakened into a tropical storm over northern Virginia shortly before passing near Washington, D.C., becoming the worst tropical cyclone there since 1896. Curving northward, the storm moved through Pennsylvania and New York before losing tropical characteristics on August 25. Now extratropical, the former hurricane moved across Atlantic Canada, dissipating on August 28.

A deleted scene for the episode shows Jim looking through Pam's graphic design projects, which he thinks are ``cool'', as well as a notebook filled with pencil sketches, which he finds a lot more impressive than her graphic design projects, implying her talents lie in hand-drawn works. In ``Two Weeks'', Pam agrees to become Michael's first saleswoman in his not-yet-established company, The Michael Scott Paper Co., as a supportive Jim looks on. When David Wallace makes an offer to buy the company Michael negotiates in order to get their jobs at Dunder Mifflin back instead, including adding Pam to the sales team. In ``Company Picnic'', Pam, after dominating the company volleyball tournament, injures her ankle during a game and is taken to the hospital against her wishes. At the hospital, the camera crew is stationed outside an exam room while a doctor updates Jim and Pam on her condition. There is no audio as the camera shows Jim and Pam embrace, looking shocked and ecstatic. It is implied that she is pregnant and is confirmed in the Season 6 premiere, ``Gossip''.

Context: In 1998, Steve Mann invented, designed, and built the world's first Linux wristwatch, which he presented at IEEE ISSCC2000 on 7 February 2000, where he was named ``the father of wearable computing''. See also Linux Journal, where Mann's Linux wristwatch appeared on the cover and was the feature article of LJ Issue 75. Seiko launched the Ruputer in Japan - a wristwatch computer with a 3.6 MHz processor. It was not very successful, since instead of a touchscreen it used a joystick-like device to input characters (much like high scores in arcade games), and the small screen with a resolution at 102x64 in 4 greyscales made it hard to read large amounts of text. Outside of Japan, this watch was distributed as the Matsucom onHand PC. Despite the rather low demand, the Matsucom onHand PC was distributed until 2006, making it a smartwatch with a rather long life cycle. Ruputer and onHand PC applications are 100% compatible. This watch is sometimes considered the first smartwatch since it was the first watch to offer graphics display (albeit monochrome) and many 3rd party applications (mostly homebrew).

Tom again denies that he committed the arson and the men start to fight. Lynette tries to break the fight but fails and Andrew has to call the police. The incident leads to the police for an investigation about the fire. While waiting for Tom being questioned by the police, Rick expresses to Lynette that he missed her so much, and that makes Lynette uncomfortable so she barges into the investigation room. Lynette lies to the police that she saw Tom leave the ball momentarily, providing him with an alibi. After the police's investigation, Lynette and Tom argue when she still does not believe Tom. Tom reveals that he did not trust her with Rick, even though Lynette assured him that nothing happened between them. Later that night, Lynette finds out that Porter and Preston are the ones who set Rick's restaurant on fire, as the twins worried that Rick may try to take Lynette away from her family.

Context: Later, a message states that the Conde Treviño, the father of Condesa Ariña, wishes to discuss an alliance with the Malficio, the group Elisa has created to conquer the Invierne. They travel to his village only to discover he has allied with the Invierne. He demands Elisa tell him where the camp is, while everyone else is held captive in his home. When Elisa refuses to give information, he kills Humberto and throws Elisa in the cell with the rest of her party. King Alejandro's men show up and break Elisa and the rest out of the cell. They escort them back to King Alejandro's palace, where Elisa is re-introduced to the king as the leader of the Malficio. The King is shocked to discover it is her, and finally announces that she is queen. At the palace, Elisa discovers her potted plant with the Godstones is missing from her room. She asks Prince Rosario to locate them for her. Days later, the army of Invierne marches in against Joya d'Arena. Elisa receives a message from Cosmé that five animagi are headed towards the palace escorted by the Invierne army. The army breaks through the palace's defenses and kills Condesa Ariña and severely injures the King. Elisa's nurses quickly plan to flee with Elisa and the Prince, but the animagi break in. Elisa steps up as the bearer of the Godstone to save her nurses, and, getting the Godstones from Prince Rosario, which he found in Ariña's room, places all four plus her own into the pendant she stole from the first animagus she encountered. This sets off an explosion that destroys all the animagi. The King dies from his wounds, and Elisa becomes queen of Joya. She is prepared for the tasks to come that God has set out for her.

Context: In humans, pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli. Whether animals apart from humans also experience pain is often contentious despite being scientifically verifiable. The standard measure of pain in humans is how a person reports that pain, (for example, on a pain scale). ``Pain'' is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as ``an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage.'' Only the person experiencing the pain can know the pain's quality and intensity, and the degree of suffering. However, for non-human animals, it is harder, if even possible, to know whether an emotional experience has occurred. Therefore, this concept is often excluded in definitions of pain in animals, such as that provided by Zimmerman: ``an aversive sensory experience caused by actual or potential injury that elicits protective motor and vegetative reactions, results in learned avoidance and may modify species-specific behaviour, including social behaviour.'' Non-human animals cannot report their feelings to language-using humans in the same manner as human communication, but observation of their behaviour provides a reasonable indication as to the extent of their pain. Just as with doctors and medics who sometimes share no common language with their patients, the indicators of pain can still be understood. 
 Question:do animals feel pain the same as humans

Context: At the beginning of season 5, Sam and Addison are back together, although they break up again as he is still not ready to commit to marriage and a family with her. Jake is hired at the practice, which at first makes Addison uncomfortable. Jake is a very gifted doctor whose speciality is helping women with fertility issues become pregnant. He becomes Addison's doctor and helps her attempt to conceive using IVF. Throughout the season, Addison and Jake grow closer. It is revealed that Jake had a wife, Lily, who was a drug addict and died from an overdose. He adopted her daughter Angela, who is featured in the final 2 seasons of the show. She is often shown advising her father and encourages him to pursue a relationship with Addison, whom he clearly has feelings for. Although Addison still has feelings for Sam, she also has feelings for Jake, the latter of whom wants to get married and have kids. On more than one occasion, Addison and Jake kiss, and both admit to have feelings for the other. However, Jake realizes that Addison is not over Sam and does not want to be a rebound, but tells her he will wait for her. Although Addison decides to stop fertility treatments, her dream of having a child finally comes true and she adopts a baby boy named Henry. Sam begins to regret his decision to leave Addison, and makes excuses to spend time with Henry, but Addison decides to focus on her baby instead of pursuing a relationship with either Sam or Jake. In the season finale, Addison and Jake have sex after Amelia delivers a brainless baby whose organs she donates so that her pregnancy will still be meaningful. When Addison arrives home, Sam is there with Henry and he proposes to Addison. It is not revealed what she says, but we also see that Jake is on his way to her house with flowers and Chinese food.

Context: Dr. Bailey is in labor, and without her husband Tucker Jones by her side, she refuses to push so she can give birth. George works with Addison to convince Bailey to have the baby. He finally gets through to Bailey by giving her the motivation that she needs, and ultimately he holds her while she delivers the baby. Izzie and Alex have sex again. Chief Richard Webber is under a lot of stress from everything that's been going on, and it is believed that he is having a heart attack, which lures his wife Adele to the hospital. However, it proves to be just an anxiety attack. Dr. Bailey's husband goes into cardiac arrest. Meredith finally removes the explosive from the patient, and Dylan, the leader of the bomb squad, carries it away. Meredith steps out of the operating room into the hallway, curiously watching Dylan walk away with the explosive, and at that moment, the bomb explodes, killing Dylan and a second bomb squad member. Meredith is knocked unconscious by the explosion. There is a revival of the ``shower scene'' from the first part, but with a more serious tone: the fully clothed Izzie and Cristina wash blood off of a stunned Meredith as George looks on. Dr. Bailey's husband and the man who had the explosive embedded in his body both survive. At the end of the episode, Preston and Derek become friends, overcoming their initial rivalry in the series beginning, and call each other by their first names. Cristina says ``I love you, too'' to a sleeping Preston. Derek comes to visit Meredith and says, ``You almost died today,'' and Meredith tells him that she can't remember their last kiss. Derek recalls the kiss for her, telling her that she ``smelled like some kind of flower,'' which Meredith says was lavender, and then he leaves.

Context: Quinn along with the New Directions alumni return in the episode ``Homecoming'' to help Rachel and Kurt rebuild the New Directions. Quinn, Santana, and Brittany attempt to recruit new members by performing in Cheerios Alumni outfits, but only recruit twins Mason and Madison when former Glee new member, Kitty, who was the only member not to be transferred as Sue saw her as a star player, announced she wouldn't return because of the way Artie treated her and everyone else when he left. Puck is still her boyfriend. She appears in ``Jagged Little Tapestry'' along with Tina to help Becky convince her new boyfriend that she is in every club of the school. Quinn, Tina, Sue, and Coach Roz get a huge surprise when they find out that Becky's boyfriend, Darrell, does not have Down syndrome like Becky does. They all get a big lesson when they confront him and realize that a person with Down syndrome should be treated like everyone else. Despite being Santana and Brittany's best friend, she is notably absent during their wedding in ``A Wedding''. She is mentioned several times during the Pilot's parallel episode ``2009'', as Finn's cheerleader girlfriend. She is later seen during Don't Stop Believin' watching the performance with Sue and Santana. She returns in the last minutes of the series finale ``Dreams Come True'' performing backing vocals for I Lived with the rest of the Glee Cast for the re-dedication of the Auditorium.

Context: In each season, eight drivers and their nominators-- Canada's Worst Driver 11 had nine drivers; more on this later-- are enrolled at the Driver Rehabilitation Centre where they compete in challenges designed to improve their driving skills, in an effort to not be named Canada's Worst Driver. In the first challenge, the contestants begin at a location about an hour's drive from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. Following the directions that are given, each contestant must drive to the Driver Rehabilitation Centre where, upon arriving, the driver's license of each contestant is confiscated (for the first two seasons, their car keys were confiscated instead). The first episode concludes with an obstacle course or assessment challenge, meant to evaluate the skills of each driver. The series is well known for its obstacle course challenges. Contestants must routinely maneuver their cars through tight spaces with less than an inch of clearance on either side. To show that the challenge can be done without hitting obstacles by an average driver, host Andrew Younghusband, himself an average driver, performs each challenge before any contestant attempts said challenge. At the end of each episode, starting with the second episode of each season, each contestant meets with Andrew and a panel of four experts for an evaluation of his or her performance. After all remaining contestants are interviewed, the experts and Andrew deliberate on which contestant and nominator pair have improved enough to graduate from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. The driver who has graduated is eliminated from the competition and is sent home with his or her license returned to him or her. Typically, the contestants drive off with their nominators in the car that they used to arrive at the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. During the series, the experts also reserve the right to not graduate anyone during an episode or to graduate multiple contestants at the same time. The experts may also choose to expel any contestant prematurely who does not show any incentive to learn, who they believe should not continue driving or who can not continue the rehabilitation program often for medical or legal reasons. In this particular instance, certain contestants are eliminated from the competition and their licenses are returned and they are given a ride home by their nominators. However, a prematurely expelled contestant or contestant who refuses to continue may still be considered for the title, as was the case in Canada's Worst Driver Ever, in which Dale Pitton was expelled in the second-to-last episode, only to be brought back for the trophy presentation. In extreme cases, the experts may contact the relevant Ministry of Transport and request that a driver's license be put up for review, if they believe that a contestant is medically unfit to continue driving. To date, this has happened only twice, in Canada's Worst Driver 4 with Donna Hicks and Canada's Worst Driver Ever with Dale. The elimination process continues until only three contestants remain (the original intent was for two contestants to remain, but due to the first season containing an episode in which no one graduated, there were three; every subsequent season has had three finalists). Those three finalists are then given the final challenge, which is typically a three-in-a-car forward-backward slalom within a certain time limit, followed by the Mega Challenge, an obstacle course with elements of almost every previous challenge (the standard transmission balancing challenge, among others, is not part of the Mega Challenge, but every challenge that is practical to include does get included), as well as a driving examination through the busy streets of a major urban centre in Canada near the Driver Rehabilitation Centre (since season seven, the road test has been in Hamilton, Ontario). Based on these three challenges, the experts determine which among the three is Canada's Worst Driver. With the exception of the eighth season, in which both Kevin Simmons and Flora Wang were named Canada's Worst Driver, the contestant who fared the second-worst is deemed to not have graduated from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre, while the contestant who fared the third-worst is considered a graduate (with the exception of the eleventh season, in which, despite faring the third-worst, Sholom Hoffman failed to graduate). Unlike other versions of the Worst Driver series around the world, where being eliminated early is rewarded with a new car while the Worst Driver has their car destroyed, Canada's Worst Driver awards no prizes aside from a trophy for being named the worst, as the point of the show is to educate rather than entertain.

Context: Dr. Bailey is in labor, and without her husband Tucker Jones by her side, she refuses to push so she can give birth. George works with Addison to convince Bailey to have the baby. He finally gets through to Bailey by giving her the motivation that she needs, and ultimately he holds her while she delivers the baby. Izzie and Alex have sex again. Chief Richard Webber is under a lot of stress from everything that's been going on, and it is believed that he is having a heart attack, which lures his wife Adele to the hospital. However, it proves to be just an anxiety attack. Dr. Bailey's husband goes into cardiac arrest. Meredith finally removes the explosive from the patient, and Dylan, the leader of the bomb squad, carries it away. Meredith steps out of the operating room into the hallway, curiously watching Dylan walk away with the explosive, and at that moment, the bomb explodes, killing Dylan and a second bomb squad member. Meredith is knocked unconscious by the explosion. There is a revival of the ``shower scene'' from the first part, but with a more serious tone: the fully clothed Izzie and Cristina wash blood off of a stunned Meredith as George looks on. Dr. Bailey's husband and the man who had the explosive embedded in his body both survive. At the end of the episode, Preston and Derek become friends, overcoming their initial rivalry in the series beginning, and call each other by their first names. Cristina says ``I love you, too'' to a sleeping Preston. Derek comes to visit Meredith and says, ``You almost died today,'' and Meredith tells him that she can't remember their last kiss. Derek recalls the kiss for her, telling her that she ``smelled like some kind of flower,'' which Meredith says was lavender, and then he leaves.

Context: Melody Brooks is an eleven-year-old girl who was born with Cerebral Palsy. Her parents have done everything they can to help her live a normal life, but life is often frustrating for Melody since she cannot speak, move, or communicate her wishes. As a result, Melody has to fight to get her wishes. At age five, Melody is even diagnosed as profoundly retarded. Despite this, Melody's mom enrolls her in Spaulding Street Elementary school to get the education she needs. However, the class she is put in is like a baby class, learning the same things every day. Melody is frustrated by this. Her neighbor, Mrs. V., is a kind, but tough woman. She pushes Melody to do the best she can. When Melody was three, Mrs. V. wasn't impressed for Melody to rely on her parents for everything. Because of this, Mrs. V. forced her to learn how to crawl and roll on the ground. She even taught Melody how to catch herself whenever she fell from her wheelchair. These things helped Melody become self-sufficient, but she continues to be reliant on her parents to help feed her and help her go to the bathroom. When Melody turns eight, her mother becomes pregnant. During this time, Melody overhears them talking about the new baby and their fears that it will suffer the same disabilities. Melody feels ashamed when she hears this. However, Melody is happy when the baby, Penny, is born perfectly healthy. Melody feels jealous as Penny grows and matures since she'll never be able to do the things Penny can do. However, Melody loves her little sister, and the pleasures Melody brings to her parents. When Melody enters fifth grade, she gets a communication device that allows her to talk with other people. At school, her new teacher starts an inclusion program that allows the special needs students to participate in the standard classes. Melody also gets an aide, Catherine, to help her. Melody befriends Rose Spencer, but is bullied by Molly and Claire, who believe that Melody's disability makes her dumber than them. Even her teacher, Mr. Dimming, believes that Melody cannot participate, but is surprised that not only does Melody join, but passes a test exam of a trivia competition with a perfect score. When he tells his class that if Melody can ace it, he is giving way too easy questions, Melody works with Ms. V in order to win the real tryouts, which she does so with a perfect score. Melody then helps the team win the qualifying competition to earn a trip to Washington D.C. for the national competition. However, on the day the group is to fly to Washington, Melody learns that her flight has been canceled due to weather, but that the rest of the team has made an earlier flight without her. Melody insists the day after the fiasco on going to school, but her mom's dismal attitude causes her to accidentally run over Penny despite Melody's attempts to warn her mother. Melody blames herself for not being able to inform her mom, even though everyone, especially Mrs. V., tells her it's not her fault. Although Melody is terrified that Penny will have a brain injury like her and be like her, she learns that Penny is going to be okay, and just has a cast on her leg. On Monday, Melody's class also apologizes for their lack of being considerate towards her by giving her their ninth place trophy, hoping to reconcile with her. However, Melody just's laughs at them and destroys the trophy by accident and says ``no you take it'' and heads out of the room. The next day, she and Catherine begin work on Melody's autobiography, which begins with the first few lines of the book.

Context: Dr. Bailey is in labor, and without her husband Tucker Jones by her side, she refuses to push so she can give birth. George works with Addison to convince Bailey to have the baby. He finally gets through to Bailey by giving her the motivation that she needs, and ultimately he holds her while she delivers the baby. Izzie and Alex have sex again. Chief Richard Webber is under a lot of stress from everything that's been going on, and it is believed that he is having a heart attack, which lures his wife Adele to the hospital. However, it proves to be just an anxiety attack. Dr. Bailey's husband goes into cardiac arrest. Meredith finally removes the explosive from the patient, and Dylan, the leader of the bomb squad, carries it away. Meredith steps out of the operating room into the hallway, curiously watching Dylan walk away with the explosive, and at that moment, the bomb explodes, killing Dylan and a second bomb squad member. Meredith is knocked unconscious by the explosion. There is a revival of the ``shower scene'' from the first part, but with a more serious tone: the fully clothed Izzie and Cristina wash blood off of a stunned Meredith as George looks on. Dr. Bailey's husband and the man who had the explosive embedded in his body both survive. At the end of the episode, Preston and Derek become friends, overcoming their initial rivalry in the series beginning, and call each other by their first names. Cristina says ``I love you, too'' to a sleeping Preston. Derek comes to visit Meredith and says, ``You almost died today,'' and Meredith tells him that she can't remember their last kiss. Derek recalls the kiss for her, telling her that she ``smelled like some kind of flower,'' which Meredith says was lavender, and then he leaves.

Context: In the season-six episode ``Ghost'', events surrounding the arrest of Liam Connors (Brian F. O'Byrne), the assassin who shot her, led to Cabot's return from the Witness Protection Program as Connors is arrested for her murder while being pursued for several others and an attempted murder of a young boy who witnessed one of his crimes. She reveals that the assumed identity she was given was an insurance salesperson originally from Tulsa, that she was living and working in Wisconsin under the name ``Emily'', and that she missed her mother's funeral in New York due to what happened. She is reluctant to see him convicted of a murder he did not commit (he does not know she is alive, either), but still wants justice and testifies against him in court. Connors goes to prison, having been found guilty under two counts of attempted murder (Cabot and an eight-year-old boy), plus five counts of murder. Upon winning the case, the SVU squad goes to Novak's office to celebrate, awaiting Cabot to join them. She does not show up, as the federal agent informs them that she has moved under a new identity and she asked him to say goodbye.

Context: Though usually considered joke prizes, traders legally win the Zonks. However, after the taping of the show, any trader who had been Zonked is offered a consolation prize (currently $100) instead of having to take home the actual Zonk. This is partly because some of the Zonks are impractical or physically impossible to receive or deliver to the traders (such as live animals or the guy in an animal costume), or the props are owned by the studio. A disclaimer at the end of the credits of later 1970s episodes read ``Some traders accept reasonable duplicates of Zonk prizes.'' Starting in the 2012--13 season, CBS invited viewers to provide Zonk ideas to producers. At the end of the season, the Zonk declared the most creative was worth $2,500 to the winner, and other viewers' Zonk ideas were also used. For every viewer-developed Zonk, the host announced the viewer who provided the Zonk. The contest has been continued throughout the past several seasons after its 2012 introduction.

Context: Dr. Bailey is in labor, and without her husband Tucker Jones by her side, she refuses to push so she can give birth. George works with Addison to convince Bailey to have the baby. He finally gets through to Bailey by giving her the motivation that she needs, and ultimately he holds her while she delivers the baby. Izzie and Alex have sex again. Chief Richard Webber is under a lot of stress from everything that's been going on, and it is believed that he is having a heart attack, which lures his wife Adele to the hospital. However, it proves to be just an anxiety attack. Dr. Bailey's husband goes into cardiac arrest. Meredith finally removes the explosive from the patient, and Dylan, the leader of the bomb squad, carries it away. Meredith steps out of the operating room into the hallway, curiously watching Dylan walk away with the explosive, and at that moment, the bomb explodes, killing Dylan and a second bomb squad member. Meredith is knocked unconscious by the explosion. There is a revival of the ``shower scene'' from the first part, but with a more serious tone: the fully clothed Izzie and Cristina wash blood off of a stunned Meredith as George looks on. Dr. Bailey's husband and the man who had the explosive embedded in his body both survive. At the end of the episode, Preston and Derek become friends, overcoming their initial rivalry in the series beginning, and call each other by their first names. Cristina says ``I love you, too'' to a sleeping Preston. Derek comes to visit Meredith and says, ``You almost died today,'' and Meredith tells him that she can't remember their last kiss. Derek recalls the kiss for her, telling her that she ``smelled like some kind of flower,'' which Meredith says was lavender, and then he leaves.

Context: Another salient aspect of ``My Generation'' is Daltrey's delivery: an angry and frustrated stutter. Various stories exist as to the reason for this distinct delivery. One is that the song began as a slow talking blues number without the stutter (in the 1970s it was sometimes performed as such, but with the stutter, as ``My Generation Blues''), but after being inspired by John Lee Hooker's ``Stuttering Blues,'' Townshend reworked the song into its present form. Another reason is that it was suggested to Daltrey that he stutter to sound like a British mod on speed. It is also proposed, albeit less frequently, that the stutter was introduced to give the group a framework for implying an expletive in the lyrics: ``Why don't you all fff... fade away!'' However, producer Shel Talmy insisted it was simply ``one of those happy accidents'' that he thought they should keep. Roger Daltrey has also commented that he had not rehearsed the song prior to the recording, was nervous, and he was unable to hear his own voice through the monitors. The stutter came about as he tried to fit the lyrics to the music as best he could, and the band decided it worked well enough to keep. The BBC initially refused to play ``My Generation'' because it did not want to offend people who stutter, but it reversed its decision after the song became more popular.

Jo accuses Stephanie of lying about her disease, and tries to get Stephanie in trouble with Amelia. Stephanie confronts Jo at Meredith's party after Jo gives a misguided apology, saying she can't take the fact that she is better than her at the job and tells her to deal with her shortcomings, as Jo used her sick past as a ``reason'' for her hyper-competence. Jo is left speechless by this. Stephanie later deals with a group of cheerleaders in the hospital. A patient named Kyle comes into the hospital and begins flirting with Stephanie. They eventually become a couple. Meredith teases Stephanie about her new love interest, Kyle, after Stephanie accidentally sends Meredith an explicit text meant for him. Stephanie is kicked off Kyle's case when Amelia finds out that they're a couple. Not being able to operate leads to her breaking up with him. She thinks breaking up with Kyle was a mistake and almost calls him while drunk.

For example, a criminal court may force a convicted defendant to pay a fine as punishment for his crime, and the legal costs of both the prosecution and defence.

In France and England, however, a victim of a crime may incidentally be awarded compensation by a criminal court judge.

Context: Dr. Bailey is in labor, and without her husband Tucker Jones by her side, she refuses to push so she can give birth. George works with Addison to convince Bailey to have the baby. He finally gets through to Bailey by giving her the motivation that she needs, and ultimately he holds her while she delivers the baby. Izzie and Alex have sex again. Chief Richard Webber is under a lot of stress from everything that's been going on, and it is believed that he is having a heart attack, which lures his wife Adele to the hospita(anxiety attack)). Dr. Bailey's husband goes into cardiac arrest. Meredith finally removes the explosive from the patient, and Dylan, the leader of the bomb squad, carries it away. Meredith steps out of the operating room into the hallway, curiously watching Dylan walk away with the explosive, and at that moment, the bomb explodes, killing Dylan and a second bomb squad member. Meredith is knocked unconscious by the explosion. There is a revival of the ``shower scene'' from the first part, but with a more serious tone: the fully clothed Izzie and Cristina wash blood off of a stunned Meredith as George looks on. Dr. Bailey's husband and the man who had the explosive embedded in his body both survive. At the end of the episode, Preston and Derek become friends, overcoming their initial rivalry in the series beginning, and call each other by their first names. Cristina says ``I love you, too'' to a sleeping Preston. Derek comes to visit Meredith and says, ``You almost died today,'' and Meredith tells him that she can't remember their last kiss. Derek recalls the kiss for her, telling her that she ``smelled like some kind of flower,'' which Meredith says was lavender, and then he leaves.

Context: Mary Ellen (Judy Norton Taylor) is the oldest of Liv and John's daughters, born in April 1920, aged 13 in season one. Throughout the first few seasons, she is a typically whiny, sometimes rebellious teenager, somewhat of a tomboy who enjoys playing baseball, but could also be vain, engaging in a rivalry with rich-girl Martha-Rose Coverdale for the affections of the awkward G.W. Haines (David Doremus). Mary Ellen matures into a wiser young woman and her childish fantasy of becoming a movie star gives way for a more reasonable and realistic ambition to go into medicine after reading up on it and developing an interest. She then works to gain an education as a medical worker, and becomes a nurse. However, when she ends up taking care of the people out in the country by herself, she concludes they need more medical expertise than she can offer them and continues studying medicine until she succeeds in becoming a fully-fledged doctor. Even though some people frown upon female doctors and she receives mixed support from her family, she refuses to let this stop her. Mary Ellen has a special relationship with each of her six siblings, but she is especially close to her younger sister Erin. Mary Ellen and Erin fought a lot when they were younger girls, particularly in seasons 1 and 2. But in the middle seasons, Mary Ellen and Erin matured and became friends. In season 5 after Mary Ellen married Curt, her relationship with her sister deepened even further and by the end of the show, they truly did become each other's best friend.

Jake is hired at the practice, which at first makes Addison uncomfortable. Jake is a very gifted doctor whose speciality is helping women with fertility issues become pregnant. He becomes Addison's doctor and helps her attempt to conceive using IVF. Throughout the season, Addison and Jake grow closer. It is revealed that Jake had a wife, Lily, who was a drug addict and died from an overdose. He adopted her daughter Angela, who is featured in the final 2 seasons of the show. She is often shown advising her father and encourages him to pursue a relationship with Addison, whom he clearly has feelings for. Although Addison still has feelings for Sam, she also has feelings for Jake, the latter of whom wants to get married and have kids. On more than one occasion, Addison and Jake kiss, and both admit to have feelings for the other. However, Jake realizes that Addison is not over Sam and does not want to be a rebound, but tells her he will wait for her. Although Addison decides to stop fertility treatments, her dream of having a child finally comes true and she adopts a baby boy named Henry. Sam begins to regret his decision to leave Addison, and makes excuses to spend time with Henry, but Addison decides to focus on her baby instead of pursuing a relationship with either Sam or Jake. In the season finale, Addison and Jake have sex after Amelia delivers a brainless baby whose organs she donates so that her pregnancy will still be meaningful. When Addison arrives home, Sam is there with Henry and he proposes to Addison. It is not revealed what she says, but we also see that Jake is on his way to her house with flowers and Chinese food.

Context: At the beginning of season 5, Sam and Addison are back together, although they break up again as he is still not ready to commit to marriage and a family with her. Jake is hired at the practice, which at first makes Addison uncomfortable. Jake is a very gifted doctor whose speciality is helping women with fertility issues become pregnant. He becomes Addison's doctor and helps her attempt to conceive using IVF. Throughout the season, Addison and Jake grow closer. It is revealed that Jake had a wife, Lily, who was a drug addict and died from an overdose. He adopted her daughter Angela, who is featured in the final 2 seasons of the show. She is often shown advising her father and encourages him to pursue a relationship with Addison, whom he clearly has feelings for. Although Addison still has feelings for Sam, she also has feelings for Jake, the latter of whom wants to get married and have kids. On more than one occasion, Addison and Jake kiss, and both admit to have feelings for the other. However, Jake realizes that Addison is not over Sam and does not want to be a rebound, but tells her he will wait for her. Although Addison decides to stop fertility treatments, her dream of having a child finally comes true and she adopts a baby boy named Henry. Sam begins to regret his decision to leave Addison, and makes excuses to spend time with Henry, but Addison decides to focus on her baby instead of pursuing a relationship with either Sam or Jake. In the season finale, Addison and Jake have sex after Amelia delivers a brainless baby whose organs she donates so that her pregnancy will still be meaningful. When Addison arrives home, Sam is there with Henry and he proposes to Addison. It is not revealed what she says, but we also see that Jake is on his way to her house with flowers and Chinese food.

Context: In Stage three (good intentions as determined by social consensus), the self enters society by conforming to social standards. Individuals are receptive to approval or disapproval from others as it reflects society's views. They try to be a ``good boy'' or ``good girl'' to live up to these expectations, having learned that being regarded as good benefits the self. Stage three reasoning may judge the morality of an action by evaluating its consequences in terms of a person's relationships, which now begin to include things like respect, gratitude, and the ``golden rule''. ``I want to be liked and thought well of; apparently, not being naughty makes people like me.'' Conforming to the rules for one's social role is not yet fully understood. The intentions of actors play a more significant role in reasoning at this stage; one may feel more forgiving if one thinks that ``they mean well''.

Context: In the twelfth season, Stephanie must help a patient recover from brain surgery, which brings back bad memories from her childhood of when she was a sickle-cell experiment participant. Jo accuses Stephanie of lying about her disease, and tries to get Stephanie in trouble with Amelia. Stephanie confronts Jo at Meredith's party after Jo gives a misguided apology, saying she can't take the fact that she is better than her at the job and tells her to deal with her shortcomings, as Jo used her sick past as a ``reason'' for her hyper-competence. Jo is left speechless by this. Stephanie later deals with a group of cheerleaders in the hospital. A patient named Kyle comes into the hospital and begins flirting with Stephanie. They eventually become a couple. Meredith teases Stephanie about her new love interest, Kyle, after Stephanie accidentally sends Meredith an explicit text meant for him. Stephanie is kicked off Kyle's case when Amelia finds out that they're a couple. Not being able to operate leads to her breaking up with him. She thinks breaking up with Kyle was a mistake and almost calls him while drunk. Later, she learns Kyle is back in the hospital with suspected meningitis, chose not to tell her and angrily refuses to let her be involved. Stephanie and Kyle reconcile, right before Amelia is unable to save his life in surgery.

Context: Two years after the events of ``All Out War,'' Andrea is shown to still be with Rick, and now has Carl calling her ``mom.'' She is preparing to run a fair that has been in preparation for months. They live in the re-built Alexandria Safe Zone with perimeter checks around the DC area to navigate their ways across the communities. She later tells Rick she agrees with the decision to send their son to the Hilltop to become a blacksmith apprentice. She bids Carl a farewell, telling him to follow Maggie's rules. In Rick's absence to trek to the Hilltop, she is the leader of the Alexandria Safe Zone. Andrea is questioned by newcomer Magna and her group about how they survived. She explains to Magna about the events of the war that unfolded. Andrea holds a gun to Negan's head as he gets cleaned up in his prison cell, but later learns Olivia forgot to lock the cell door. She later urges the returned Rick to kill him again. The morning before the fair, Andrea wakes up early and meets with Siddiq to check on the structure for the fair, tearing up at the sight of vendors and booths being set up. When she learns of Carl's disappearance, she joins Rick, Michonne, and Dante in a mission to bring him back safely. Once they are held hostage by the Whisperers, a tribe of thousands disguised as roamers, she sees the marked border of territories where she witnesses dozens of people she knew from each of the communities with their heads on spikes. After the massive walker herd swarms Alexandria, Andrea and a group of other survivors including Magna, Eugene and Yumiko try to lead the walkers away. Eugene and Andrea lead a large portion of the herd towards the ocean. Eugene attempts to lead more of the walkers away with the horn, but Andrea is reluctant. Andrea and the others stare in shock at the small wound on her neck which is revealed to be a bite from a walker. Upon returning to Alexandria, Rick and others say their farewells as she slowly passes away. Before her death, she reminds Rick to stay strong and continue to lead the community to rebuild society. Andrea eventually reanimates as walker and tries to kill Rick, only for him to stab her in the head with a knife.

After seeing the carbon tubes in his bones on the results of an X-ray at the hospital, Tulsa tells Gardner she now believes he was born on Mars, but plans to leave him in the hospital, before foster care can come, as he is too sick to continue their journey. Gardner reveals that he knows he won't last on Earth anymore and all he wants is to meet his father before he dies. Tulsa gives in and helps him escape. They steal a car and drive to the beach house. There, they meet the man from the video, who reveals that he is not Sarah Elliot's husband, but her own brother. However, he thinks that the two are lying to him.

Context: Stahr asks Cecelia to arrange for a meeting with a suspected communist who wants to organise a labour union within the film studio. Stahr and Cecelia meet the man over supper where Stahr gets drunk and gets involved in a violent confrontation. Cecelia takes care of him and they grow closer. Cecelia's father, however, becomes more and more unhappy with Stahr as a business partner and has wanted to get rid of him for a long while. He could not approve less of his daughter's fancying him. Brady knows of Stahr's continued affair with the now-married Kathleen and tries to blackmail him into leaving the company. As he fails to achieve his goal via blackmail, he does not even shy away from hiring a professional killer. Stahr survives, and, in retaliation, also appoints a man to have Brady killed. Unlike Brady's, Stahr's conscience starts to trouble in. But, just as he contemplates calling the execution off, his plane crashes on its way back to New York City. The contract killer finishes his job unhindered and leaves Cecelia both without a father and without a lover -- the two men who meant the world to her.

Context: In 1937, Warner introduced its Alphabet Bra with four cup sizes (A, B, C, and D) to its product descriptions. Before long, these cup sizes got nicknames: egg cup, tea cup, coffee cup, and challenge cup, respectively. Two other companies, Model and Fay-Miss (renamed in 1935 as the Bali Brassiere Company), followed, offering A, B, C, and D cup sizes in the late 1930s. Catalog companies continued to use the designations Small, Medium, and Large through the 1940s. Britain did not adopt the American cups in 1933, and resisted using cup sizes for its products until 1948. The Sears Company finally applied cup sizes to bras in its catalog in the 1950s.

Context: Greg and Jack's relationship goes off with a bang when Greg is left alone to babysit Little Jack, whom Jack has been raising via the Ferber method. Despite Jack's instructions to leave Little Jack to self-soothe, Greg is unable to stand listening to Little Jack's cries and tends to the boy to cheer him up by hugging him, letting him watch TV, acting funny, and inadvertently teaching Little Jack the word ``asshole.'' Disaster strikes when Greg answers a brief phone call from Roz, which is long enough for Little Jack to wander out of his playpen (after being opened by Jinx), put on Scarface and glue his hands to a bottle of rum. After a furious argument with the Fockers and his own family (though amends are quickly made), Jack resumes his spying on Greg and sends Greg and Jorge's hair samples for a DNA test, while inviting Jorge to the Fockers' planned engagement party in the hope of getting Greg to admit he is Jorge's father. At the engagement party, Jack, who automatically assumes that Greg knew about Jorge and has deliberately been keeping him a secret from Pam, introduces Greg to Jorge. Later, when Greg denies knowing anything about Jorge, Jack still refuses to believe him and drugs him with truth serum to make him talk. On stage, Greg uncontrollably blurts out that Pam is pregnant and that Jorge is his son in a Darth Vader-esqe matter before immediately losing consciousness.

Context: Taste buds contain the taste receptor cells, which are also known as gustatory cells. The taste receptors are located around the small structures known as papillae found on the upper surface of the tongue, soft palate, upper esophagus, the cheek and epiglottis. These structures are involved in detecting the five elements of taste perception: salty, sour, bitter, sweet and umami; through the combination of these elements we detect ``flavors.'' A popular myth assigns these different tastes to different regions of the tongue; in reality these tastes can be detected by any area of the tongue. Via small openings in the tongue epithelium, called taste pores, parts of the food dissolved in saliva come into contact with the taste receptors. These are located on top of the taste receptor cells that constitute the taste buds. The taste receptor cells send information detected by clusters of various receptors and ion channels to the gustatory areas of the brain via the seventh, ninth and tenth cranial nerves. 
 Question:are all your taste buds on your tongue
