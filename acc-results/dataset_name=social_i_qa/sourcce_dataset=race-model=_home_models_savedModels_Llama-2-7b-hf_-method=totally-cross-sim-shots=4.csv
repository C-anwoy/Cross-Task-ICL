When Zach arrived, he asked if Bradley wanted to drive his car. Bradley had a driver's license. Bradley said all right. Zach told him not to drive fast, but that he could drive anywhere he wanted. Bradley got on the road. Zach gave Bradley a few driving tips: Don't drive next to big trucks, because you never know when they might crush  you.

Context: The drug store was closing for the night. Young Alfred Higgins, the shop-assistant, was ready to go home. Mr. Carr, the boss, stared at him and said: ""Stop! Alfred. Maybe you'd be good enough to take the things out of your pockets and leave them here before you go."" Alfred's face got red. After a little hesitation , he took out what he had stolen. Mr. Carr said, ""Maybe I should call you mother and let her know I'm going to have to put you in prison.""
Alfred thought his mother would come rushing in, eyes burning with anger. But, to his surprise, she arrived wearing a smile. ""Hello, I'm Alfred's mother. Is he in trouble?"" she said. Mr. Carr was surprised, too. He had expected Alfred's mother to come in nervously, shaking with fear, asking with wet eyes for a mercy   for her son. Yet, she was most calm, quiet, and pleasant, which made Mr. Carr feel guilty  . Soon Mr. Carr was shaking his head in agreement with what she was saying. ""Of course"", he said, ""I don't want to be cruel. You are right. Sometimes, a little good advice is the best thing for a boy at certain times in his life and it often takes the youth a long time to grow up."" And he warmly shook Mrs. Higgins's hand. 
Back home, without even looking at Alfred, she said, ""You are a burden. Your trouble came one after another, always! Why do you stand there so stupidly? Go to bed."" In his bedroom, Alfred heard his mother in the kitchen. Getting to the kitchen, he saw his mother drinking a cup of tea. His mother's face was a frightened, broken one, totally different from the earlier cool, bright face. She lifted the tea cup, her hands shaking, the lips moving nervously. 
He watched his mother quietly, without making a sound. The picture of his mother nearly made him cry. Realizing all the troubles he brought his mother in her shaking hands and the deep lines of worry in her grey face, he felt he shouldn't have done such a shameful theft to hurt his mother so deeply. He determined to grow up like a true man and protect his mother rather than hurt her again. 
 Question:The reason why Mr. Carr felt guilty was that   _  . 
A. Alfred's mother appeared polite and gentle 
B. he should have called a policeman at first 
C. he found Alfred was in fact not wrong 
D. he thought he was partly responsible for it

Context: The prisoner had waited many months for help, but none had come. Now he felt he would do something to gain his freedom, to be free again to go about the world as he wished. But he could think of no way to run away.
He spent many hours thinking of his life before he was captured, regretting the mistakes he had made and dreaming of the joys he had known. And over and over he said to himself that he was being punished for no reason. He was guilty of no crime, but he had not been given a chance to explain the events which made him guilty.
Then one night the guard who sat outside the prisoner's door fell asleep. When he noticed this, the prisoner was struck by a feeling of hope. Perhaps he could steal the keys while the guard was sleeping.
Silently the prisoner moved toward the guard. Very gently he lifted the ring of keys from the guard's belt. Then he turned and crawled toward the door. Could he work the lock from the inside? The key turned and the door was opened. Within two minutes he had crossed the yard and climbed the wall. Then he ran across the field, free at last, a smile of joy beginning to spread across his face. 
 Question:The prisoner had a wish  _  . 
A. to be excused 
B. to go away freely with his family 
C. to be a free man in the prison 
D. to be helped out of the prison 
 Answer: D
Context: The drug store was closing for the night and Alfred Higgins was about to go home when his new boss approached him.
""Empty your pockets please, Alfred,"" Sam Carr demanded in a firm voice.
Alfred pretended to be shocked but he knew he had been caught. From his coat he withdrew a make-up kit, a lipstick and two tubes of toothpaste.
""I'm disappointed in you, Alfred!"" said the little gray-haired man.
""Sorry, sir. Please forgive me. It's the first time I've ever done such a thing,"" Alfred lied, hoping to gain the old man's sympathy.
Mr Carr's brow furrowed as he reached for the telephone, ""Do you take me for a fool? Let's see what the police have to say. But first I'll call your mother and let her know her son is heading to jail.""
""Do whatever you want,"" Alfred shot back, trying to sound big. But deep down he felt like a child. He imagined his mother rushing in, eyes burning with anger, maybe in tears. Yet he wanted to come quickly before Mr. Carr called the police.
Mr. Carr was surprised when Mrs. Higgins finally arrived . She was very calm, quiet and friendly. ""Is Alfred in trouble?"" she asked.
""He's been stealing from the store,"" the old man coolly replied.
Mrs. Higgins pulled out her hand and touched Mr. Carr's arm with great gentleness as if she knew just how he felt. She spoke as if she did not want to cause him any more trouble. ""What do you want to do, Mr.Carr?""
The woman's calm and gentle manner _ the once-angry store-owner, ""I was going to get a cop. But I don't want to be cruel. Tell your son not to come back here again and I will let it go."" Then he warmly shook Mrs. Higgins' hand.
Mrs. Higgins thanked the old ma for his kindness, then mother and son left. They walked along the street in silence. When they arrived home his mother simply said, ""Go to bed, you fool.""
In his bedroom, Alfred heard his mother in the kitchen. He felt no shame, only pride in his mother's actions. ""She was smooth!"" he thought. He went to the kitchen to tell her how great she was, but was shocked by what he saw.
His mother's face looked frightened, broken. Not the cool, bright face he saw earlier. Her lips moved nervously. She looked very old. There were tears in her eyes.
This picture of his mother made him want to cry. He felt his youth ending. He saw all the troubles he brought her and the deep lines of worry in her grey face. It seemed to him that this was the first time he had ever really seen his mother. 
 Question:What was the mother's attitude towards Alfred? 
A. She felt disappointed with him. 
B. She was strict with him. 
C. She was supportive of him. 
D. She was afraid of him.

Context: Writer and power chair adventurer Mary Laver has not walked for twenty years. Yet the cheerful and positive 60 year old is not only refusing to let her disability get her down ---- she is also planning to cross the length of Britain in a power wheelchair.
Getting ready for the trip is not easy. She has already run into many problems - not least officials and organizations who view her as a health and safety risk. One police officer wrote to Mary requesting:
1. The proposed route through our area with road numbers.
2. The dates and times each day that this will be taking place.
3. The location details of the proposed overnight stops.
4. The names and mobile phone contact details of the Support Crew.
Another police officer asked her to travel off road! As Mary told me, this was unacceptable - as a power wheelchair user with limited movement _ "".
There are other problems in her way though - she is, after all, in her 60's and has severe rheumatoid arthritis . However, unlike many other people with arthritis, she is no longer in pain.
""When you are in a power chair and it is going at eight miles an hour, believe me it feels fast ... to me it is the Formula One  chair of electric wheelchairs.""
At the end of the interview, I asked Mary if she had a message for any other power chair users who wanted to do a challenge, and her reply was simple:""Just do it!"" 
 Question:What is Mary Laver planning to do? 
A. Travel to write a power wheelchair adventure. 
B. Travel across Britain in a power wheelchair. 
C. Prove she can do what a man can in driving. 
D. Try a fast Formula One power chair sport.

If you have ever been to a Perlman concert, _ him.He was stricken with polio as a child,and so he has braces on both legs and walks with the aid of two crutches .
He walks painfully, yet majestically, until he reaches his chair.Then he sits down,slowly, puts his crutches on the floor, undoes the clasps on his legs,tucks one foot back and extends the other foot forward.Then he bends down and picks up the violin, puts it under his chin,nods to the conductor and proceeds to play.
But this time,something went wrong.Just as he fmished the first few bars ,one of the strings on his violin broke.You could hear it snap ---it went off like gunfire across the room.There was no mistaking what that meant.There was no mistaking what he had to do.
We figured that he would have to get up,put on the clasps again,pick up the crutches and limp his way off stage-to either find another violin or else find another string for this one.But he didn't.Instead.he waited a moment,closed his eyes and then signaled the conductor to begin again.
The orchestra began,and he played from where he had left off.And he played with such passion and such power and such purity as they had never heard before.
When he finished, there was an awesome silence in the room.And then people rose and cheered.He smiled,wiped the sweat from this brow, raised his bow to quit us,and then he said in a quiet tone.""You know, sometimes it is the artist's task to find out how much music you can still make with what you have left.''

Context: She almost did not run. Christine Williams admits that now. She could barely put one foot after another following the wake  for her sister, who had died in an automobile accident. But she did run. With the cheers of friends and strangers reaching her heart, Williams set a C.W. Post record in Boston. Now she will run again, in the national Division II cross-country championships in Evansville, Ind. She wanted to be sure she was doing the right thing by running. She was the middle of three sisters, between Kerry, who is 25, and Jennifer, who was 18.
Just going through any motions was hard enough, but Christine Williams wanted to know if she should put on her uniform and her shoes and run through the woods on an autumn afternoon, in the awful gaping time between her sister's wake and her funeral. ""I kind of got upset beforehand."" Williams admitted. Not a chatterbox under normal conditions, she now holds herself the best way she can, the fewer words the better. She almost walked away from the start line. But her friend Angela Toscano, who had flown up to Boston with her, directly from the wake, was standing near the line and talked her through it. ""She said my sister would have wanted me to run."" Christine said. And that was enough to get her started.
The accident happened just after midnight on Nov, 4. Four young women were driving in an unfamiliar area of Long Island in Eastport, N.Y., when one of them apparently ran a yield sign, and the car was hit by another vehicle. Heather Brownrigg and Jennifer Williams died, and their friends April Brown and Kaci Moran were treated at a hospital and released.
The crash made the papers. April Brown was charged with drunken driving and driving without a license.
The wake began on Nov. 6. The next day Christine was to run with the Post cross-country team at the regional meet. Rich Degnan, the Post coach,""and Post officials offered a car service and tickets on the last flight-to Boston for Christine and Toscano. When they arrived at the hotel, the entire team was waiting up for her.
Everybody knew about it at the regional meet. Degnan had to arrange for the flexibility of an alternate, just in case Christine could not go. Several times during the race, Christine felt she could not continue. But then she heard her friends and all those other people, those strangers from other colleges, calling her name. She thought about Jennifer. And she ran. She finished fourth in 22 minutes 58 seconds, breaking the Post record for the 6-kilometer distance by 15 seconds. And although the Post team didn't qualify for the nationals, Christine did. 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that   _  . 
A. Christine's two sisters were killed in the accident 
B. Christine's athletic performance stood out in the race 
C. Christine flew to Boston after her sister's funeral 
D. Christine broke the Post record in national meet in Boston

Context: Providing a highquality education for all children is important to America's economic future.President Obama has decided to provide every child with access to a complete and competitive education,from cradle  through career.
The years before a child reaches kindergarten are among the most _ in his or her life to influence learning.The President will urge states to introduce high standards across all publicly funded early learning settings,develop new programs to improve opportunities and outcomes,engage parents in their child's early learning and development,and improve the early education workforce.
President Obama will reform America's public schools to deliver a 21st century education that will prepare all children for success in the new global workplace.He will push to end the use of ineffective,""offtheshelf"" tests,and support new,stateoftheart assessment and responsibility systems that provide timely and useful information about the learning and progress of students.
Teachers are the single most important resource to children's learning.President Obama will invest in a national effort to reward outstanding teachers,while enlisting the best and brightest in the field of teaching.And he will challenge State and school districts to remove ineffective teachers from the classroom.
The President believes that investment in education must be accompanied by reform and innovation  .He supports the expansion of highquality charter schools  .He has challenged States to lift limits that stop growth among successful charter schools and has encouraged strict responsibility for all charter schools.
President Obama has decided to ensure that America will regain its lost ground and have the highest proportion of students graduating from college in the world by 2020.The President believes that regardless of educational path after high school,all Americans should enroll in at least one year of higher education or job training to better prepare our workforce for the 21st century economy.
To reach these goals,the President has decided to increase higher education access and success by restructuring and greatly expanding college financial aid,while making federal programs simpler,more reliable,and more efficient for students. 
 Question:Which of the following things is NOT part of President Obama's decision? 
A. Remove ineffective teachers from the classroom. 
B. Reform America's public schools. 
C. Enlist some teachers from other countries. 
D. Expand highquality charter schools. 
 Answer: C
Context: Pushy parents and teachers who ""hothouse"" the under-5s risk causing damage to the children's long term development, a leading education expert said.
Lilian Katz, Professor of Education at the University of Illinois, said that four-year-olds engaged in reading and writing went on to perform worse academically than those engaged in imaginative learning. They scored higher in tests at the age of 5, but children whose first year at school was stimulating _ them four years later.
The findings suggest that the government's structured approach to early years' learning could be storing up problems for children. They also raise serious questions about the plan for all children to be able to read by the age of 6.
In many countries formal teaching does not start until children are 6 or 7 and have improved their social and manual skills. Children start learning to read and write at 6 in the United States, France and Germany, and at 7 in Finland and Sweden.
Professor Katz said that in many schools the courses were ""boring children to tears"". Much academic teaching required children to learn by memorizing pieces of information out of context, she said. Teaching in reception class should instead allow children to develop their intellect by exploring their environments and asking questions.
""Research suggests the benefits of formal academic instruction for four- and five-year-olds seem to be promising when they are tested early, but considerably less so in the long term. When these children are followed over a period of three or more years, those who had early experience in more intellectually engaging curricula were more likely to do well in school than their peers, who had received early academic instruction."" She advocates teaching children through first-hand experience and play, in mixed-aged classes. This can include puppet shows, drawing or running a pretend shop in the classroom. 
 Question:According to Lilian Katz, the government's structured approach to early-years learning   _  .

Context: Many children act in TV shows. They work several hours every day, so they can not go to regular school. How do they get an education?
In Hollywood, many TV shows are made. About forty teachers give lessons to the children in the shows. They teach wherever their pupils are working. The teachers' job is very important. They are responsible  for making sure that the children work only the permitted  hours each week. They are also responsible for making sure that children learn the required subjects. They make sure, too, that the children get enough rest and play, along with their education.
Children actors are required to attend classes twenty hours each week. California law says they must be taught from September to June. If they do not make much progress in school, they are not permitted to continue working in TV shows. TV children are usually good pupils, and most of their teachers like this special kind of work. Their classes are held in some wonderful places. Sometimes the ""classroom"" is a Mississippi riverboat, and sometimes it is the inside of a spaceship. Often the pupils become famous TV or movie stars.

Context: Every day from the time we wake up until the time we go to bed, we are bombarded with information from all sides, from TV, radio, newspapers and books; from family, friends, and colleagues. As a new cable television subscriber, I am  ly amazed at the quantity and varying levels of information quality on cable television. Including the networks, there are eight TV ""news"" organizations vying to provide us with all the information we can possibly absorb. Newspaper, magazines, books, radio, the Internet, email, snail mail, and the telephone all compete for our attention and our minds. At the office conversations around the water cooler and coffee maker serve to spread even more items of information.
  There is valuable information out there about the world we live in, on topics as varied as health, safety, traffic, nutrition, business, finance, philosophy, nature, science, weather, history and the human condition. There is also a large amount of misleading and outright false information, not just on controversial subjects such as politics and religion but on any topic one can think of, including all of the topics mentioned above.
  With all this information coming at us from all directions, how does one sift through it all to sort out the facts from the fiction, the truth from the lies, the more important from the less important? Should we turn off the TV, cancel our newspaper subscriptions, disconnect our phones and modems to become information ""hermits""? Probably not.
  A better method of sifting through the information wave without being overwhelmed and confused is to become a skeptical inquirer-or skeptic-with regard to the surrounding world. By ""skeptic""-I do not mean a cynic-a person who rejects new ideas simply because they are new. A skeptic is one who questions the validity of a particular claim by calling for evidence to prove or disprove it. Skepticism is a method, not a position. It is a provisional approach to all factual claims. In terms of processing information, a skeptic needs to be able to grasp reality and acquire knowledge about the environment that agrees with reason, logic, and evidence. In other words, as skeptics, when we hear a claim that may or may not be fantastic, we should say, ""That's nice, prove it."" 
 Question:When faced with an incredible or fantastic claim, what shall we do according to the author? 
A. Ask questions and look for proof. 
B. Ignore the information and its source. 
C. Change the subject immediately. 
D. Try to consult an expert who knows the truth. 
 Answer: A
Context: The newspaper must provide for the reader the facts, pure, unprejudiced , objectively selected facts. But in these days the complex news it must provide more; it must supply explanation, the meaning of the facts. This is the most important assignment facing American journalism--to make clear to the reader the problems of the day, to make international news understandable as community news, to recognize that there is no longer any such thing(with the possible exception of society news)as ""local"" news, because any event in the international area has local reaction in the financial market, political circles, indeed, of our very way of life. There is in journalism a widespread view that when you consider giving an explanation, you are entering dangerous water, the swirling tides of opinion. This is nonsense.
The opponents of explanation insist that the writer and the editor shall confine himself to the ""facts"". This insistence raises two questions; What are the facts? And are the bare facts enough? As for the first question, consider how a so-called ""factual"" story comes about. The reporter collects, say, fifty facts; out of these fifty, his space being necessarily restricted, he selects the ten that he considers most important. This is Judgment Number One. Then he or his editor decides which of these ten facts shall constitute the beginning of the article. (this is an important decision because many readers do not proceed beyond the first paragraph) This is Judgment Number Two. Then. The night editor decides whether the article shall be presented on page one, where it has a large influence, or on page twenty-four, where it has little. Judgment Number Three.
Thus in the show of a so-called ""factual"" of ""objective"" story, at least three judgments are involved. And they are judgments mot at all unlike those involved in explanation, in which reporter and editor, calling upon their research resources , their general background, and their ""news neutralism"" , arrive at a conclusion as to the importance of the news.
The two areas of judgment, presentation of the news and its explanation, are both objective rather than subjective processes--as objective, that is, as any human being can be. (Note in passing; even though complete objectivity can never be achieved, nevertheless the ideal must always be the light in the murky news channels) If an editor is intern on giving a prejudiced view of the news, he can do it in other ways and more effectively than by explanation. He can do it by the selection of those facts that support his particular viewpoint. Or he can do it by the play he gives a story promoting it to page one or putting it on page thirty. 
 Question:The best title for this passage is     . 
A. Function of the Night Editor 
B. Explaining the News. 
C. Subjective versus Objective Processes 
D. Choosing Facts 
 Answer: B
Context: Six years ago, a Miami woman walking through the hall of an office building casually noticed two men standing together. Several minutes after her leaving, the men murdered a person working in the building. Police investigators determined that the woman was the only witness who had seen the two suspects, and could possibly describe them. In an interview with police, her memory of the men proved disappointingly unclear.
Several days later, psychologist Ronald P. Fisher was brought in to get a more complete description from the woman. Fisher's interview produced a breakthrough--the woman reported a clear picture of one of the suspects. She then recalled several details about his appearances. This information gave police important leads that enabled them to arrest the suspects and close the case. 
Police investigators found the help from Fisher because of his rich knowledge in conducting the so-called cognitive   interview, a kind of memory-rebuilding process. In its original form, the cognitive interview focuses on guiding witnesses through four general recalling techniques: thinking about physical surroundings and personal feelings that existed at the time of past events, reporting everything that comes to mind about those events no matter how broken or unconnected, retelling events in kinds of time orders, beginning to end, end to beginning, forward or backward, and accepting different views while recalling events.
Usually, an interviewer begins the cognitive approach by encouraging the witness to take an active role in recalling information rather than giving answers only to someone else's questions. The witness first describes what happened in his or her own words, with no interviewer interruptions. The interviewer then goes further with specific techniques, such as having the witness tell the details of what happened from different aspects.
Experiments with police detectives trained in this demanding interview method find that they get nearly 50% more information from witnesses than before training, while error rates remain about the same. 
 Question:Police trained in the cognitive interview method can   _  . 
A. get more information from the witness than before 
B. decrease the error rate 
C. solve the cases more quickly 
D. use the method more skillfully than the psychologists

Context: After moving to a small town, I took several pairs of shoes to the shoemaker to be fixed. Within a week I picked them up and put them away in my closet.

The night before the first exam, Barbala insisted that she should have an early night and take a sleeping pill. She promised to wake her in the morning.
As she was falling asleep, Kate was worried in case she over-slept. Her mind kept jumping from subject to subject.

Context: The girl was hanging by her hands from the railings of a balcony . The balcony was on the twelfth floor of the high-rise block next to his. His flat was on the ninth floor and he had to look up to see her. It was half-past six in the morning. He had been awakened by the sound of an aircraft flying dangerously low overhead, and had got out of bed to look. His sleepy eyes, moved from the blue sky which was empty of cloud, empty of anything but the bright disappearing arrow of the aircraft, and then rested on the hanging figure.
He really thought he must be dreaming, for this sunrise time was the hour for dreams. Then, when he knew he wasn't, he decided it must be a scene in a film. There were cameramen down there, a whole film unit, and all the correct safety precautions had been taken. Probably the girl wasn't even a real girl, but a dummy . He opened the window and looked down. The car park, paved courts, grass spaces between the blocks, all were deserted. On the balcony rail one of the dummy's hands moved, desperately. He had to believe then what was obviously happening. The girl was trying to kill herself. She had lost her courage and now was trying to stay alive. All these thoughts and conclusions of his occupied about thirty seconds. Then he acted. He picked up the phone and dialed the emergency number for the police.
The arrival of the police cars and the rescue of the girl became the focus of talk for the people of the two blocks. Someone found out that it was he who had called the police and he became an unwilling hero. He was a modest, quiet young man, and was in relief when the talk began to die away. Again he was able to enter and leave his flat without being pointed at as a kind of St George and sometimes even congratulated.
About a fortnight after that morning, he was getting ready to go to the theatre, just putting on his overcoat, when the doorbell rang. He didn't recognize the girl who stood outside. He had never seen her face. She said, ""I'm Lydia Simpson. You saved my life. I've come to thank you.""

Context: One evening after dinner, Mr. and Mrs. Tisich called a family meeting. ""We've had to make a difficult decision,"" Mr. Tisich announced. ""You see, your mother has been offered a post as co-director of a television station in Chicago. Unfortunately, the station is not here. After thinking long and hard about it, we've concluded that the right decision is to move to Chicago."" Marc looked shocked, while his sister Rachel breathlessly started asking when they'd be moving. ""It's surprising, but exciting!"" she said. Marc simply said, ""We can't go--I can't leave all my friends. I'd rather stay here and live with Tommy Lyons!""
The Tisichs hoped that by the time they moved in August, Marc would grow more used to the idea of leaving. However, he showed no signs of accepting the news, refusing to pack his belongings. When the morning of the move arrived, Marc was nowhere to be found. His parents called Tommy Lyon's house, but Mrs. Lyons said she hadn't seen Marc. Mrs. Tisich became increasingly concerned, while her husband felt angry with their son for behaving so irresponsibly.
What they didn't know was that Marc had started walking over to Tommy's house, with a faint idea of hiding in Lyons's attic  for a few days. But something happened on the way as Marc walked past all the familiar landscape of the neighborhood: the fence that he and his mother painted, the tree that he and his sister used to climb, the park where he and his father often took evening walks together. How much would these mean without his family, who make them special in the first place? Marc didn't take the time to answer that question but instead hurried back to his house, wondering if there were any moving cartons the right size to hold his record collection.

A. he did not want to be left behind

Context: I never thought I would have a life-changing experience at Wal-Mart.
Although my thoughts were only on speed, the checkout line I was standing in wasn't moving as quickly as I wanted, and I glanced toward the cashier.
There stood a man in his seventies, wearing glasses and a nice smile. I thought, well, he's an old guy!
For the next few minutes I watched him. He greeted every customer before scanning the items. Sure, his words were the usual, ""How's it going?"" But he did something different--he actually listened to people. Then he would respond to what they had said and engage them in brief conversation.
I thought it was odd. I has grown accustomed to people asking me how I was doing simply out of robotic conversational habit. After a while, you don't give any thought to the question and just mumble something back. I could say, ""I just found out I have six months to live,"" and someone would reply, ""Have a great day!""
But that wasn't the end.
He gave them the change, walked around the counter, and extended his right hand in an act of friendship. He looked the customers in the eyes. ""I sure want to thank you for shopping here today,"" he told them. ""You have a great day. Bye-bye.""
The looks on the faces of the customers were priceless. There were smiles and some sheepish grins. All had been touched by his simple gesture--and in a place they never expected. They would gather their things and walk out, smiling.
Of course, he did the same to me and I got to know his name--Marty.
Who was that guy? It was as if Sam Walton had come back from the dead and invaded this old guy's body.
I had never walked away from that shop feeling like that. 
 Question:According to the writer, when common people ask you ""How's it going?"" 
A. they are just practicing their conversation ability 
B. they are inquiring about your private information 
C. they don't expect to hear any negative answers 
D. they don't really care what you may answer 
 Answer: D

Someday, he told himself, his big opportunity would come.
Larry found a job parking cars for one of Hollywood's big restaurants. His pay was basic, but since the guests were kind enough to give him more money, he managed to make a living. One day he recognized an important film director driving into the parking lot and getting out of his car. Larry had recently heard that the man was ready to make a new picture.

Instead of pushing away the boy,the director laughed,then wrote something on a card and handed it to the young man."" Come and see me tomorrow.""

Context: It was something she had dreamed of since she was five. Finally, after years of training and intensive workouts, Deborah Duffey was going to compete in her first high school basketball game. The goals of becoming an outstanding player and playing college ball were never far from Deborah's mind.
The game was against Mills High School. With 1 minute and 42 seconds left in the game, Deborah's team led by one point. A player of Mills had possession of the ball,and Deborah ran to guard against her. As Deborah was running to block the player, her knee went out and she fell down on the court in burning pain. Just like that, Deborah's season was over.
After suffering the bad injury, Deborah found that, for the first time in her life, she was in a situation beyond her control. Game after game, she could do nothing but sit on the sidelines watching others play the game that she loved so much.
Injuries limited Deborah's time on the court as she hurt her knees three more times in the next five years. She had to spend countless hours in a physical clinic to receive treatment. Her frequent visits there gave her a passion and respect for the profession.  And Deborah began to see a new light in her life.
Currently as a senior in college, Deborah focuses on getting a degree in physical treatment. After she graduates, Deborah plans to use her knowledge to educate people how to best take care of their bodies and cope with the feelings of hopelessness that she remembers so well.

Context: She almost did not run. Christine Williams admits that now. She could barely put one foot after another following the wake  for her sister, who had died in an automobile accident. But she did run. With the cheers of friends and strangers reaching her heart, Williams set a C.W. Post record in Boston. Now she will run again, in the national Division II cross-country championships in Evansville, Ind. She wanted to be sure she was doing the right thing by running. She was the middle of three sisters, between Kerry, who is 25, and Jennifer, who was 18.
Just going through any motions was hard enough, but Christine Williams wanted to know if she should put on her uniform and her shoes and run through the woods on an autumn afternoon, in the awful gaping time between her sister's wake and her funeral. ""I kind of got upset beforehand."" Williams admitted. Not a chatterbox under normal conditions, she now holds herself the best way she can, the fewer words the better. She almost walked away from the start line. But her friend Angela Toscano, who had flown up to Boston with her, directly from the wake, was standing near the line and talked her through it. ""She said my sister would have wanted me to run."" Christine said. And that was enough to get her started.
The accident happened just after midnight on Nov, 4. Four young women were driving in an unfamiliar area of Long Island in Eastport, N.Y., when one of them apparently ran a yield sign, and the car was hit by another vehicle. Heather Brownrigg and Jennifer Williams died, and their friends April Brown and Kaci Moran were treated at a hospital and released.
The crash made the papers. April Brown was charged with drunken driving and driving without a license.
The wake began on Nov. 6. The next day Christine was to run with the Post cross-country team at the regional meet. Rich Degnan, the Post coach,""and Post officials offered a car service and tickets on the last flight-to Boston for Christine and Toscano. When they arrived at the hotel, the entire team was waiting up for her.
Everybody knew about it at the regional meet. Degnan had to arrange for the flexibility of an alternate, just in case Christine could not go. Several times during the race, Christine felt she could not continue. But then she heard her friends and all those other people, those strangers from other colleges, calling her name. She thought about Jennifer. And she ran. She finished fourth in 22 minutes 58 seconds, breaking the Post record for the 6-kilometer distance by 15 seconds. And although the Post team didn't qualify for the nationals, Christine did. 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that   _  . 
A. Christine's two sisters were killed in the accident 
B. Christine's athletic performance stood out in the race 
C. Christine flew to Boston after her sister's funeral 
D. Christine broke the Post record in national meet in Boston

Context: One day Marilla said, ""Anne, your new teacher, Miss Stacy, spoke to me yesterday. She says you must study for the examinations for Queen's College in two years' time. Then if you do well, you can study at Queen's in Charlottetown for a year, and after that you'll be a teacher!""
""That doesn't matter, Anne. When Matthew and I adopted you three years ago, we decided to look after you as well as we could. Of course we'll pay for you to study.""So in the afternoons Anne and some of her friends stayed late at school, and Miss Stacy helped them with the special examination work. Diana didn't want to go to Queen's, so she went home early, but Gilbert stayed. He and Anne still never spoke and everybody knew that they were enemies, because they both wanted to be first in the examination. Secretly, Anne was sorry that she and Gilbert weren't friends, but it was too late now.
For two years, Anne studied hard at school. She enjoyed learning, and Miss Stacy was pleased with her. But she didn't study all the time. In the evenings and at weekends she visited her friends, or walked through the fields with Diana, or sat talking to Matthew.
""Your Anne is a big girl now. She's taller than you,"" Rachel Lynde told Marilla one day.
""You're right, Rachel!"" said Marilla in surprise.
""And she's a very good girl now, isn't she? She doesn't get into trouble these days. I'm sure she helps you a lot with the housework, Marilla.""
""Yes, I don't know what I'd do without her,"" said Marilla, smiling.
""And look at her! Those beautiful grey eyes, and that red-brown hair! You know, Marilla, I thought you and Matthew made a mistake when you adopted her. But now I see I was wrong. You've looked after her very well.""
""Well, thank you, Rachel,"" replied Marilla, pleased.
That evening, when Matthew came into the kitchen, he saw that his sister was crying.
""What's the matter?"" he asked, surprised. ""You haven't cried since... well, I can't remember when.""
""It's just... well, I was thinking about Anne,"" said Marilla. ""I'll...I'll miss her when she goes away.""
""When she goes to Queen's, you mean? Yes, but she can come home at weekends, on the train.""
""I'll still miss her,"" said Marilla sadly.""
In June the Avonlea boys and girls had to go to Charlottetown to take their examinations.
""Oh, I do hope that I've done well,"" Anne told Diana when she arrived back at Green Gables. ""The examinations were very difficult. And I've got to wait for three weeks before I know! Three weeks! I'll die!""
Anne wanted to do better than Gilbert. But she also wanted to do well for Matthew and Marilla. That was very important to her.
Diana was the first to hear the news, she ran into the kitchen at Green Gables and shouted, ""Look, Anne! It's in Father's newspaper! You're first... with Gilbert... out of all the students on the island! Oh, how wonderful!"" Anne took the paper with shaking hands, and saw her name, at the top of the list of two hundred. She could not speak.
""Well, now, I knew it,"" said Matthew with a warm smile.
""You've done well, I must say, Anne,"" said Marilla, who was secretly very pleased.
For the next three weeks Anne and Marilla were very busy. Anne needs new dresses to take to Charlottetown.

Context: A study has found, spending hours playing violent video games prevents teenagers from their moral growth. It is thought that regular touch to violence and lack of contact with the outside world makes it harder for them to tell right from wrong.They also struggle to trust other people,and see the world from their viewpoints.
Researchers from Brock University in Ontario found that those who spend more than three hours each day in front of the screen are particularly unlikely to have developed the ability to empathize .
The Canadian researchers surveyed 109 boys and girls,aged 13 and 14,about whether they played video games,which games they liked,and how long they spent playing them.Their findings found that 88 percent of teens said they played games,and more than half admitted to playing games every day.Violent games were among the most popular.
The teenagers also filled in a questionnaire designed to measure their moral development.For example,they were asked how important it is to save the life of a friend.
Previous studies have suggested that a person's moral judgment goes through four phases as they grow from children and enter adulthood.By the age of 13 or 14,scientists claim young people should be entering the third stage,and be able to empathize with others and take their viewpoints into account.The research found that this stage appeared to be delayed in teenagers who regularly played violent video games.
It is also thought that teenagers who play games regularly did not spend enough time in the real world to learn to take others' thoughts into consideration.Researcher Mirjana Bajovic said:""The present results indicate that some teenagers, who spent three or more hours a day playing violent video games,are deprived of such opportunities."" he added:""Touch to violence in video games may influence the development of moral reasoning because violence is not only presented as acceptable but is also justified and rewarded.""
They concluded that rather than trying to enforce an 'unrealistic' ban on the games,parents and teachers should encourage teenagers to do charity work and take up after-school activities. 
 Question:What does Mirjana Bajovic want to tell us according to his words? 
A. Playing games regularly will improve teens' intelligence. 
B. Vio1ent games cost teens social experiences in real life. 
C. Playing games makes teens help others. 
D. Playing games inspires teens to develop fast.

Context: Several weeks ago, kidsPost did a story on ""The Art of Video Games"" at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The exhibition has created debate with some people saying that as fun as video games are ,they are not works of art. Other people say that videos games may be a new form of art and that they belong to in museums. We asked readers for their opinions on the topic. Here are a few of the letters we received.
A video game is like a painting on a screen. In order to make a video game, you have to think of something original to reach the players. This is the point of Art.
---Mary Pottanat,13
I believe video games are not a form of art. Art should be a visual  and creative expression of feelings. Although it is arguable that video games are visual ,they do not express feelings in any way.
---Prannab Kirshnan,12
However exciting video games are, they are not art. Painting is art, but not video games. Art has beauty and culture that no technology could ever compare to. Even though you can create art in some video games, the "" Mona Lisa"" wasn't painted with Nintendo.
---Caroline Kaplan,10
Art is a way of communicating ideas to the public in a way that is fun to them. The ""public"", who in this case are kids and adults, are finding these video games from different time periods interesting. Video games would not have been art if it had not been for the kids and adults attracted by ""the art of video games"".
---Ryan Puthumana,10 
 Question:Who's the author? 
A. An artist. 
B. A video game creator. 
C. Someone who works at KidsPost. 
D. Someone who works in a museum.

Context: Mr. and Mrs. Harris had always spent their summer holidays in a small hotel at the seaside near their hometown. One year, however, Mr.  Harris made a lot of money in his factory, so they decided to go to a foreign country and stay at a really good hotel.
They flew to Paris, and arrived at a 5-star hotel late in the evening. They thought they would have to go to bed hungry, because in that small hotel where they used to stay in the past, no meals were served after seven in the evening. They were surprised to be told that the hotel served dinner until ten.

Context: Humor is a most effective, yet frequently neglected, means of handling the difficult situations in our lives. It can be used for patching up differences, apologizing, saying ""no,"" criticizing, getting the other fellow to do what you want without his losing face. For some jobs, it's the only tool that can succeed. It is a way to discuss subjects so sensitive that serious dialogue may start a quarrel. For example, many believe that comedians on television are doing more today for racial and religious tolerance than people in any other forum.
Humor is often the best way to keep a small misunderstanding from escalating into a big deal. Recently a neighbor of mine had a squabble with his wife as she drove him to the airport. Airborne, he felt miserable, and he knew she did, too. Two hours after she returned home, she received a long-distance phone call. ""Person-to-person for Mrs. I. A. Pologize,"" intoned the operator. ""That's spelled 'P' as in..."" In a twinkling, the whole day changed from grim to lovely at both ends of the wire.
An English hostess with a quick wit was giving a formal dinner for eight distinguished guests whom she hoped to enlist in a major charity drive. Austerity was a fashion in England at the time, and she had asked her children to serve the meal. She knew that anything could happen--and it did, just as her son, with the studied concentration of a tightrope walker, brought in a large roast turkey. He successfully elbowed the swinging dining-room door, but the backswing threw the bird onto the dining-room floor.
The boy stood rooted: guests stared at their plates. Moving only her head the hostess smiled at her son,"" No harm, Daniel,"" she said. ""Just pick him up and take him back to the kitchen""... she enunciated clearly so he would think about what she was saying... ""and bring in the other one.""
A wink and a one-liner instantly changed the dinner from a red-faced embarrassment to a conspiracy of fun. 
 Question:Which of the following is NOT stated in the passage? 
A. Comedians on TV are believed to have done a lot in making people more tolerant of racial and religious differences. 
B. To make up differences, humor is a most acceptable as well as a most effective means. 
C. People often turn to humorous ways when meeting with difficult situations because of its effectiveness. 
D. Only by adopting the means of humor can one succeed in some jobs.

Context: I never thought I would have a life-changing experience at Wal-Mart.
Although my thoughts were only on speed, the checkout line I was standing in wasn't moving as quickly as I wanted, and I glanced toward the cashier.
There stood a man in his seventies, wearing glasses and a nice smile. I thought, well, he's an old guy!
For the next few minutes I watched him. He greeted every customer before scanning the items. Sure, his words were the usual, ""How's it going?"" But he did something different--he actually listened to people. Then he would respond to what they had said and engage them in brief conversation.
I thought it was odd. I has grown accustomed to people asking me how I was doing simply out of robotic conversational habit. After a while, you don't give any thought to the question and just mumble something back. I could say, ""I just found out I have six months to live,"" and someone would reply, ""Have a great day!""
But that wasn't the end.
He gave them the change, walked around the counter, and extended his right hand in an act of friendship. He looked the customers in the eyes. ""I sure want to thank you for shopping here today,"" he told them. ""You have a great day. Bye-bye.""
The looks on the faces of the customers were priceless. There were smiles and some sheepish grins. All had been touched by his simple gesture--and in a place they never expected. They would gather their things and walk out, smiling.
Of course, he did the same to me and I got to know his name--Marty.
Who was that guy? It was as if Sam Walton had come back from the dead and invaded this old guy's body.
I had never walked away from that shop feeling like that. 
 Question:According to the writer, when common people ask you ""How's it going?"" 
A. they are just practicing their conversation ability 
B. they are inquiring about your private information 
C. they don't expect to hear any negative answers 
D. they don't really care what you may answer

Context: The interview has been going on for about 20 minutes and everything seems to be going well.Then, suddenly, the interviewer asks an unexpected question, ""Which is more important, law or love?""
Job applicants in the West increasingly find themselves asked strange questions like this.And the signs are that this is beginning to happen in China.
Employers want people who are skilled, enthusiastic and devoted.So these are the qualities that any reasonably intelligent job applicant will try to show no matter what his or her actual feelings are.In response, employers are increasingly using the questions which try and show the applicant's true personality.
The question in the first paragraph comes from a test called the Kiersey Temperament Sorter.It is an attempt to discover how people solve problems, rather than what they know.This is often called aptitude   test.
According to Mark Baldwin of Alliance, many job applicants in China are finding this type of questions difficult.""When a Chinese fills out an aptitude test, he or she will think there is a right answer but they may fail because they try to guess what the examiner wants to see.""
This is sometimes called the prisoner's dilemma .Applicants are trying to act cleverly in their own interest, but they fail because they don't understand what the interviewer is looking for.Remember that in an aptitude test, the correct answer is the honest answer. 
 Question:What is the purpose of the passage? 
A. To give a piece of advice to job interviewees. 
B. To tell you how to deal with job interviews. 
C. To advise you how to find a good job. 
D. To describe an aptitude test.

Context: School education is very important and useful. The students both learn knowledge and get an education. Yet, no one can learn everything from school. The scientists,such as Edison,Newton,Galileo and Einstein, didn't learn everything from school. They learned a lot of knowledge outside school or in practice by themselves.

The teacher's job is to show his students how to learn, how to read and how to think. A good teacher with rich experience in teaching can teach his students the methods(="" ways)of"" study. Through these methods the students are able to learn and get a lot of things by themselves.
Usually it is very easy for the students to remember some knowledge, but it is very difficult to use it for problems.

Context: When I was in college, a man named Henry worked as a custodian  in our student union building. White-haired, with a Pennsylvania Dutch accent, Henry could usually be seen in a baseball cap, a T-shirt and a pair of jeans.
He was the custodian, and he was the most respected and most well-known person in the building. Everyone loved Henry, and it was because of all the implicit ways he expressed his love for everyone around him. Henry didn't have to say, ""I love you."" He lived his love.
Henry was always excited when he met someone new, and he wanted to know everything about them. He felt it was important to do things for people he valued. And Henry seemed to value everyone he met. He brought in articles or cartoons for certain people, went out of his way to introduce people to each other, kept dozens of names and birthdays in his wallet so he could send cards, and helped students keep in touch with graduates who had written to him. He even assisted students who didn't have enough money to buy their books. 
Henry taught me --- and many others he supported --- how to live life to the fullest. Not by skydiving or exploring some foreign countries, but by appreciating where you are in life and valuing those around you.
The funny thing is that despite all he did and taught us, Henry truly believed that he was the lucky one --- that he was the one who was gaining so much by getting to know us. But all of us who remember Henry know that we were the ones who were truly blessed. 
We will never forget the man who taught us that best way to say ""I love you"" often has little to do with the words. 
 Question:According to the passage, working as a custodian in a college, Henry   _  . 
A. made international travels to live a full life 
B. was a role model of how to be a caring person 
C. was busy organizing former students' reunions

Context: That year, in the local school, there was a new math teacher, as well as some new pupils. One of the new kids was the stupidest child that anyone had ever seen. It made no difference how quickly or how slowly they tried explaining numbers to him; he would always end up saying something enormously stupid. Like two plus two was five, seven times three was twenty-seven, or a triangle had thirty corners...

Context: I had a very good teacher named Leon Sultan .I liked him very much.
Mr. Sultan had just got a job at my high school but his name wasn't in the school's system. So when I got my schedule ,it read:  Staff F. It was during _ hat I  realised that ""Staff F"" was Mr.  Sultan. When he called my name, he asked if I remembered him. Then I realised that he was the teacher who had taught me English when I was in primary school.
Mr. Sultan was a very special teacher. Even though he was older and had been to college, but he was Still ready to learn from others. He would listen to your opinion carefully before expressing his opinion.
I think what he taught me more than anything else is to have an open mind Another thing I couldn't forget was his teaching method -group work
There were four members in the group. Each group had its own topic. Everyone in the group would play a certain role. One would keep the discussion moving, the other one would write down the thoughts of the group, another one would be responsible for gathering information, and another one would share everything the group had discovered with the rest of the class. This allowed us to become ""experts"" on one topic and teach the rest of our classmates.
Now ,I have become a more open-minded boy. That is because of my two and a half years in Mr.  Sultan's class. 
 Question:What was strange about the author's schedule?

B. It was taken away by Mr. Sultan. 
C. It didn't show Mr. Sultan's name. 
D. t didn't have the courses that he had chosen.

Context: There is no such thing as ""the perfect parent"" and everyone has to learn how to educate their children. Parents may be annoyed by their kids and yell   at then, but they should be careful not to yell at the children.
Children need to be loved and cared for. They need positive encouragement, which will help them believe that they can succeed in their lives. This will also give them opportunities to explore and try out new things. If parents yell at their children, the emotional   development of them can be badly affected.
Though parents think they are protecting their children at all times, the children will not feel safe when they are yelled at. It can be a very bad experience for children. This can make it difficult for children to enjoy parents' presence   if they are being yelled at.
A person needs to be a good listener and also should learn to give others a chance to talk. When a child grows up with parents who often yell, this will not happen. When parents often yell, their children will also learn the same thing and they will find it natural not to listen to anyone.
The confidence   of a child is built up by his or her parents. There is no doubt that yelling will only decrease their confidence level. The words used while yelling can affect them greatly. They will not want to do anything without asking for their parents' permission. 
 Question:Which is the best title of the passage? 
A. Be a perfect parent 
B. Don't yell at your children 
C. Parents should learn how to educate the children 
D. Parents should protect their children

One day, I was walking home from school when I heard voices behind me. ""There's the little idiot's  sister. Does your sister wet her pants too?"" I walked a little faster and then I felt a atone hit me in the back. When I got home, I ran down to my sister's room.
I pushed my way into her room, screaming at her. ""Why do you have to be that giri's friend? I don't see anyone else being nice to her, "" Janelle yelled back, Because she is a wonderful person and she is dying!"" I will remember those words as long as I live.

Context: It was the Greek shopkeeper who taught me about the power of being kind.
In 2008, I left Spain to study alone in London. My parents had to bring up  my three younger sisters and two younger brothers, so I found three part-time jobs to pay for my studies. I worked early mornings and late nights, so I was tired, really tired, all the time.
Unluckily, I got a cold and had a very high fever. Because I was new in London, I had no friends. Besides, I was too shy to talk with others and ask others for help. After sleeping on the bed for two days, I went out to get some food. Usually, I went to the supermarket, but this time I went into the Greek shop, a small corner shop, because it was closer.
I picked up some food and gave it to the shopkeeper, who asked me, 'You look terrible, my boy! You are not feeling well, right?'
I said YES in a low voice.
She pointed at the salami   and bread I was buying and offered, 'I can make you a sandwich, so you don't have to do it yourself.'
I nodded without saying a word.
So, she made the sandwich and asked me to wait a moment. She went into the back room and came again with a bowl of hot soup.
'It will warm you up,' she said with a friendly smile.
What really warmed me up was not the soup. It was her smile that told me she cared me. Her kindness  made me think of my mother.
I was quite shy, but from that day on, I did not let shyness stop me from talking with and being kind to others. Now I work in a children's hospital in Africa. I love my work and people around me. I always bring my smile and kindness to them. 
 Question:What did the shopkeeper not do for the writer? 
A. She made the sandwich. 
B. She cooked a bowl of hot soup. 
C. She made some bread. 
D. She sold him some salami.

Context: Once Dr. Mellinkoff invited me to join him at the hospital to discuss interesting cases with his students . The case at hand was a Guatemalan man , aged 34 , who had a fever and many other medical problems . His condition was not improving , and there was not much hope he would live .
Dr. Mellinkoff asked to see the patient . He introduced himself in Spanish and , in a very gentle voice , asked how he felt . The patient smiled and said everything was all right . Then the doctor asked if he was able to eat . The patient said that he had no desire to eat .
"" Are you getting food you like ? ""
The patient said nothing .
"" Do you get the kind of food you have at home ? ""
The answer was no .
The doctor put his hand on the man's shoulder and his voice was very soft .
"" If , you had food that you liked , would you eat it ? ""
"" Yes , yes . "" the patient said .
The change in the patient's appearance couldn't have been more obvious . Nothing was said , but it was easy to tell that a message had been sent and had also been received .
Later , the doctor asked why the Guatemalan man wasn't getting food he could eat . One of the students said , "" We all know how difficult it is to get the kitchen to make special meals . ""
"" Suppose , "" the doctor replied , "" you felt a certain medicine was  ly necessary but that our hospital didn't carry it , would you accept defeat or would you insist the hospital meet your request ? ""
"" I would probably insist , "" the student said .
"" Very well , "" the doctor said . "" You might want to try the same method in the kitchen . It won't be easy , but I can help you . Meanwhile , let's get some food inside this man as fast as possible , and stay with it . Or he'll be killed by hunger . By the way , there must be someone among you who can speak Spanish . If we want to make real progress , we need to be able to talk with him . ""
Three weeks later , Dr. Mellinkoff told me that the Guatemalan man had left the hospital under his own power . It takes more than medicine to help sick people ; you also have to talk to them and make them comfortable .

As I was running off the stage, I accidentally knocked over a glass of grape juice that was on a table. The purple juice hit the girl next to me --- Andrea, the leading actress of the drama. She gave me a nasty look. I thought she was going to kill me!
But then, Andrea quickly said, ""Darling, you're so silly! Let's toast  to my darling's silliness! Cheers!"" She grabbed another glass of grape juice and drank it. The other actor quickly followed Andrea's lead and saved the scene. The audience thought my mistake was part of the play!
I apologized to everyone after the play. To my surprise, they were not angry with me. They told me, ""It's all a part of being on stage."" I could be wrong, but I think I liked being on stage. I think I will try again. 
 Question:Which of the following was a problem in the story? 
A. Andrea was the leading actress of the drama. 
B. Andrea drank the grape juice. 
C. The writer had only one line.

Context: One evening after dinner, Mr. and Mrs. Tisich called a family meeting. ""We've had to make a difficult decision,"" Mr. Tisich announced. ""You see, your mother has been offered a post as co-director of a television station in Chicago. Unfortunately, the station is not here. After thinking long and hard about it, we've concluded that the right decision is to move to Chicago."" Marc looked shocked, while his sister Rachel breathlessly started asking when they'd be moving. ""It's surprising, but exciting!"" she said. Marc simply said, ""We can't go--I can't leave all my friends. I'd rather stay here and live with Tommy Lyons!""
The Tisichs hoped that by the time they moved in August, Marc would grow more used to the idea of leaving. However, he showed no signs of accepting the news, refusing to pack his belongings. When the morning of the move arrived, Marc was nowhere to be found. His parents called Tommy Lyon's house, but Mrs. Lyons said she hadn't seen Marc. Mrs. Tisich became increasingly concerned, while her husband felt angry with their son for behaving so irresponsibly.
What they didn't know was that Marc had started walking over to Tommy's house, with a faint idea of hiding in Lyons's attic  for a few days. But something happened on the way as Marc walked past all the familiar landscape of the neighborhood: the fence that he and his mother painted, the tree that he and his sister used to climb, the park where he and his father often took evening walks together. How much would these mean without his family, who make them special in the first place? Marc didn't take the time to answer that question but instead hurried back to his house, wondering if there were any moving cartons the right size to hold his record collection. 
 Question:The reason for Marc's going home was that  _  . 
A. he did not want to be left behind 
B. he realized his family was important to him 
C. he hoped to reach an agreement with his parents 
D. he wished to be a more responsible person

She worked hard all day, but just before the exams she was working so hard that her sister was worried about her. She was staying up too late . The night before the first exam, Barbala insisted that she should have an early night and take a sleeping pill. She promised to wake her in the morning.
As she was falling asleep, Kate was worried in case she over-slept. Her mind kept jumping from subject to subject. At last, with the help of the pill, she fell asleep. she was sitting in the examination hall, looking at the paper. She couldn't answer any of the questions. Everyone round her was writing pages and pages. However hard she thought, she couldn't find anything to write about. She kept looking at her watch. Time was running out. There was only one hour left. She started one question, wrote two sentences, gave up and tried another one. With only half an hour left she wrote another two sentences. By this time she was so worried that she started crying.

Context: My son Gilbert was eight years old and had been in the Cub Scouts   only a short time. Once he was handed a sheet of paper, a block of wood and four tires and told to return home and give them all to his father. That was not an easy task for Gilbert to do. The piece of paper was a set of instructions about how to build a wooden racing car. Gilbert's father laughed when he read the instructions. The block of wood remained untouched as the weeks passed.
Finally, I stepped in to see if I could figure it all out. Having no skills, I decided it would be best if I simply read the instructions and let Gilbert do the work. And he did. Within days, his block of wood was turning into a pinewood racing car.
Then the big night came. With his pinewood racing car in his hand and pride in his heart we headed to the big race. As the race was done in elimination fashion  , you could keep racing as long as you were the winner.
Finally, it was between Gilbert and the fastestlooking car there. As the race was about to begin, Gilbert asked if they could stop for a minute, because he wanted to pray. Then the race stopped.
Gilbert prayed in earnest for a very long minute. The Master came up to Gilbert and asked the obvious question, ""So you prayed to win, Gilbert?""
My young son answered, ""Oh, no Sir. It wouldn't be fair to ask God to help you beat someone else. I just asked him to make it so I don't cry when I lose.""
Children seem to have wisdom far beyond us. Perhaps we spend too much of our prayer time asking God to control the race, make us the champion, or remove us from the struggle, when we should be seeking God's strength to get through what lies in our way. 
 Question:Who finally made the pinewood racing car? 
A. Gilbert. 
B. Gilbert's father. 
C. Gilbert's mother. 
D. The whole family.

Context: Maxwell had not held a steady job in almost two years. Today was a big day, because he was going to a job interview that he felt good about. The secretary he had talked to on the phone sounded friendly and encouraging. 
Maxwell was a typist. His fingers danced on the keyboard. However, his people skills were not nearly as good as his typing skills. Sometimes his mouth got in the way of his employment. At his last steady job, his boss had told him to start making coffee every morning. Maxwell laughed. ""I'm not making coffee,"" he said. ""It's not part of my job description."" 
""Read the employee manual again,"" his boss said. ""Your job description is anything I say it is."" 
""That's a woman's job,"" said Maxwell. ""Do it yourself."" 
His boss was still yelling as Maxwell walked out of the building. He felt great about telling off the boss. A few days later, the reality of not having a job hit home. He had to pay the rent and utility bills, and he had to eat. What was he going to do? 
He thought about apologizing and asking for his job back. But how would that look? Then again, who cares how it looks when you're almost broke? After thinking about it for another week, he finally called his boss and apologized. His boss accepted his apology, but said that he had already hired a replacement. 
Maxwell contacted a temporary job agency, which provided him enough occasional work to pay his bills. But none of the companies that he was sent to were hiring. So Maxwell was excited about finally getting an interview for a steady job. 
Maxwell's drive to the interview was disappointing. The traffic was  _ and the neighborhood looked rough. It took him 45 minutes to get there. The building was covered with graffiti.  
The interview started 30 minutes late. Not bothering to apologize, the manager lit a cigarette and took a sip from his coffee cup. He leaned back in his chair and put his feet up on his desk. He asked Maxwell a lot of questions. Maxwell thought that each question was stupider than the preceding question. The final question was, ""Where would you like to be 10 years from now?"" 
What does that have to do with typing? Maxwell wondered. Stupid questions from a rude man in a lousy neighborhood! Where would he like to be 10 years from now? 
""Anywhere but this dump!"" Maxwell said angrily, as he stood up and walked out. 
 Question:According to the passage, which statement is right about the job interview? 
A. Maxwell was 30 minutes late. 
B. The manager got no manners in the interview. 
C. The interviewer asked a lot of silly questions except the last one. 
D. Maxwell misunderstood the interviewer's questions.

Context: Dar and I loved to dance. It was probably the first thing we did together, long before we would share our lives.
We grew up in a small Oregon mountain community where dances were held almost every Saturday night. Dar was seventeen and l was thirteen when we first danced. He was one of the best dancers on the floor, and so was I. We always jitterbugged. No slow dancing for us; nothing remotely romantic.
Our fathers would stand along the wall and watch. Every once in a while, Dar's dad would smile a little and say, to no one in particular, but my dad could hear, ""Boy, my kid can sure dance."" _ he acted like he'd never heard. But a while later he would say, to no one in particular, ""That girl of mine can sure dance.""
Our dancing together stopped for five years while Dar was in the South Pacific in World War II. When we met again, Dar was twenty-two, and l was eighteen. We began to date and dance again. We were as good together as we remembered, and this time we added slow dancing.
For us, life is a dance, a movement of rhythms, directions, stumbles, missteps, at times slow and precise, or fast and wild and joyous. We did all the steps.
Two nights before Dar died, the family were with us. We all ate dinner together, and Dar sat with us. He hadn't been able to eat for several days. After dinner, I put on a Nat King Cole tape. Dar took me in his arms, weak as he was, and we danced and smiled. No tears for us. We were doing what we had loved to do for more than fifty years. It was our last dance---forever unforgettable. I wouldn't have missed it for the world. 
 Question:The author first danced with Dar when  _  .

B. they began to date each other 
C. they began to share their lives 
D. Dar returned from the South Pacific

Context: Wishing to encourage her young son to make more progress on the piano, a mother took her boy to a Paderewski concert. After they were seated, the mother spotted a friend in the audience and walked down the aisle to greet her. Seizing the opportunity to explore the wonders of the concert hall, the little boy rose and eventually found his way through a door marked ""NO ADMITTANCE."" When the house lights dimmed and the concert was about to begin, the mother returned to her seat and discovered that the child was missing.
Suddenly, the curtains parted and spotlights focused on the impressive Steinway on stage. To her horror, the mother saw her little boy sitting at the keyboard, innocently picking outTwinkle, Twinkle Little Star.
At that moment, the great pianist made his entrance, quickly moved to the piano, and whispered in the boy's ear, ""Don't quit. Keep playing."" Then leaning over, Paderewski reached down with his left hand and began filling in a bass part. Soon his right arm reached around to the other side of the child and he added a melody. Together, the old master and the young beginner transformed a frightening situation into a wonderfully creative experience. The audience was amazed and, as it finished, they cheered.

But when we put our trust in the hands of a Greater Power, our life's work can be truly beautiful. Next time you set out to accomplish great feats, listen carefully.

Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""
It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on. 
 Question:That man called after reading about what Jordan did to a disabled child because he wanted to   _  . 
A. become famous himself 
B. know why Jordan appeared in a poor area 
C. let the author know that Jordan was not that nice 
D. offer another example to show that Jordan was a nice man

She washed it herself, but to save soap she only washed the bottom of the dress, where it touched the ground. Other people had their own offices, but Hetty used a desk in the bank where she kept her money, because it didn't cost anything. She sat in the bank and ate her sandwiches while she bought and sold stocks and shares. If the bank complained, she just moved all her money to another bank.

Hetty refused and took the boy away. His leg got worse and two years later doctors removed it.
But eventually Ned got his revenge  . At the age of 81, Hetty had an argument with a shop assistant about the price of a bottle of milk. She became so angry that she had a heart attack and died.

Four years later,Swift became a multiaward winner.This month,she was crowned ""Woman of the Year"" by Billboard magazine,the youngest singersongwriter ever to receive the honor.""Aged only 21,Taylor has already made a maior impact on music and has been an unbelievable role model for hopeful artists and young women everywhere,"" said Bill Werde,Billboard's director.
 _ Unlike many pop singers,especially those who do not write their own material,Swift has the power of turning her ideas into lyrics that will set people thinking.""Hidden beneath Taylor Swift's notagirl,notyetawoman sweetness is a very skillful songwriting technique,"" wrote Leah Greenblatt in an American magazine.
Songwriting,as Swift explains,is to cope with issues.""I tend to write about things that really impact me most."" There certainly seems to be something true and honest running through every one of the 14 songs on her album,Speak Now,about ""the lessons and confusion and heartbreak and all the different things that go along with being 18,19 and 20.""
""For the audience too young to have experienced real passion or heartbreak,Swift's songs are like a potential road map,promising things will work out OK,"" commented Dorian ynskey in a British newspaper.
Now Swift is getting ready to go further and has so far written about 10 songs for her 2012 album,which is about feelings of growing up and becoming an adult.""They're sad,if I'm being honest.""""They're about my heartbreaks and my moving on.But more importantly,they are about achieving contentment.You're not always going to be perfectly happy as you grow up."" 
 Question:What is the best title for the passage? 
A. Swift comes to people's attention 
B. Swift rises to fame 
C. Swift wins many awards 
D. Swift experiences real passion

Context: Simon hardly listened to his teachers or worked hard in class. For him, talking was so much better. He never stopped talking. He wanted to be heard. ""If you listen carefully, you'll learn something."" Mrs. Jacobs told him many times, but it didn't work.

But it wasn't so bad. He could do his homework. The next day,  even though his voice was coming back, he stayed quiet again. He listened and put up his hand to speak. What a great difference!

 Answer: C
Context: Earthquake in Japan.Donald Trump is accused of planting story about actress's height after she rejected him. Mexico arrests ex-police chief in case of 43 missing students. Do you really need to know all these things?
Three years ago, I began an experiment. I stopped reading all newspapers and magazines. Televisions and radios were rejected. I deleted the news apps from my iPhone. I didn't touch a single free newspaper and deliberately looked the other way when someone tried to offer me any such reading material. The first weeks were hard. Very hard! I was constantly afraid of missing something. But after a while, I had a new understanding. The result after three years: clearer thoughts, more valuable ideas, better decisions, and much more time. And the best thing? I haven't missed anything important.
A dozen reasons exist to _ . Here are the top three: First, our brain reacts differently to different types of information. Shocking, people-based, fast-changing details all appeal to us. News producers capitalize on this. The result: Everything complex, abstract, and profound  must be systematically singled out, even though such stories are much more relevant to our lives and to our understanding of the world. As a result, we walk around with a misrepresented mental map of the risks and threats we actually face.
Second, news is irrelevant. In the past year, you have probably consumed about ten thousand pieces of news. Be very honest: Name one of them, just one that helped you make a better decision--for your life, your career, or your business--compared with not having this piece of news. No one I have asked has been able to name more than two useful news stories--out of ten thousand. News organizations claim that their information gives you a competitive advantage. Too many fall for this. If news really helped people advance, journalists would be at the top of the income pyramid.
Third, news is a waste of time. An average human being spends half a day each week reading about current affairs. This is a huge loss of productivity. Take the 2008 terror attack in Mumbai. Let's say a billion people viewed the minute-by-minute updates and listened to the chatter of a few ""experts"" and ""commentators."" Thus our conservative calculation: One billion people multiplied by an hour's distraction equals one billion hours of work stoppage. News wasted around two thousand lives--ten times more than the attack.
I would predict that turning your back on news will benefit you as much as removing any of the other ninety-eight errors we have covered in the pages of this book. Read long background articles and books. Nothing beats books for understanding the world. 
 Question:How did the author feel at the beginning of his experiment? 
A. He was in constant fear. 
B. He enjoyed it very much. 
C. He had a better vision about life. 
D. He missed his friends and relatives.

Context: The sun had gone behind a cloud. I was very tired and wanted nothing in the world so much as to be at home. At last I got to the gate of Hide Park. But this was worse than ever; there were buses there--high and terribly red cars, taxis and still more buses in an endless line. Everywhere there were people hurrying past or waiting to get into the buses, while I stood lost in the middle of them.
I was ready to cry. In despair, I crossed the street on to an ""island"", where I found a policeman. I took my last bit of courage in both hands and said, ""Please, sir, where is Addison Road?"" He began to explain, but when he saw that I couldn't understand he became helpless, too. ""Are you French at school?"" A few minutes later, he smiled and raised his hand. How wonderful!

Context: Failure is probably the most exhausting experience a person ever has. There is nothing more tiring than not succeeding.
We experience this tiredness in two ways: as start-up fatigue  and performance fatigue. In the former case, we keep putting off a task because it has either too boring or too difficult. And the longer we delay it, the more tired we feel.
Such start-up fatigue is very real, even if not actually physical, not something in our muscles and bones. The solution is obvious though perhaps not easy to apply: always handle the most difficult job first.
Years ago, I was asked to write 102 essays on the great ideas of some famous authors. Applying my own rule, I determined to write them in alphabetical , never letting myself leave out a tough idea. And I always started the day's work with the difficult task of essay-writing. Experience proved that the rule works.
Performance fatigue is more difficult to handle. Though willing to get started, we cannot seem to do the job right. Its difficulties appear so great that, however hard we work, we fail again and again. In such a situation, I work as hard as I can-then let the unconscious take over.
When planning Encyclopaedia Britannica (<<>> ), I had to create a table of contents based on the topics of its articles. Nothing like this had ever been done before, and day after dat I kept coming up with solutions, but none of them worked. My fatigue became almost unbearable.
One day, mentally exhausted, I wrote down all the reasons why this problem could not be solved. I tried to convince myself that the trouble was with the problem itself, not with me. Relived, I sat back in an easy chair and fell asleep.
An hour later, I woke up suddenly with the solution clearly in mind. In the weeks that followed, the solution which had come up in my unconscious mind provided correct at every step. Though I worked as hard as before, I felt no fatigue. Success was now as exciting as failure had been depressing.
Human beings, I believe must try to succeed. Success, then, means never feeling tired. 
 Question:According to the author, the unconscious mind may help us  . 
A. ignore mental problems 
B. get some nice sleep 
C. gain complete relief 
D. find the right solution

Context: Allow me to introduce you to Terry, a window salesman from England. If I could take you back about 20 years, you'd know Terry as a complete green hand, who was wet behind the ears in just about everything he attempted. _ You know, the kind who could sell snow to Eskimos.
Terry's boss decided to send him out on a practical field trip on his first day. So off he went, but he was extremely nervous. With his hands and his knees shaking, he approached the front door and knocked at is. And old woman appeared. After dozens of cups of tea and pieces of biscuits, the woman signed a contract and purchased over $7,000 worth of windows.
The woman had already talked with 6 excellent salesmen that week, all of whom offered her cheaper ones! That's right---Terry's price was the most expensive and he was also the most inexperienced salesman there ever was.
So, what happened then? Here comes the secret. The woman said she liked the young lad more than the others. That's all there was to it. She didn't care about the extra expense. Even the other salesmen couldn't persuade her to pay less than this young lad was asking for.
The truth is that the young lad left on the woman the first impression that shone brighter than any of the salesman's talk. First impressions count, not the sales techniques, not the low prices. The actual ""personality"" the kid honestly gave was all that was required. If you market your own products and services, consider what impression you are giving to others. If you appeal to them, then you've already done half of the work. If this means redesigning your presentation, then so be it. If this means going out of your way to be polite, helpful and giving the best possible shopping experience to your customers, the so be it. 
 Question:The passage is most likely written to  _  . 
A. new salesmen 
B. general readers

Context: Dar and I loved to dance. It was probably the first thing we did together, long before we would share our lives.
We grew up in a small Oregon mountain community where dances were held almost every Saturday night. Dar was seventeen and l was thirteen when we first danced. He was one of the best dancers on the floor, and so was I. We always jitterbugged. No slow dancing for us; nothing remotely romantic.
Our fathers would stand along the wall and watch. Every once in a while, Dar's dad would smile a little and say, to no one in particular, but my dad could hear, ""Boy, my kid can sure dance."" _ he acted like he'd never heard. But a while later he would say, to no one in particular, ""That girl of mine can sure dance.""
Our dancing together stopped for five years while Dar was in the South Pacific in World War II. When we met again, Dar was twenty-two, and l was eighteen. We began to date and dance again. We were as good together as we remembered, and this time we added slow dancing.
For us, life is a dance, a movement of rhythms, directions, stumbles, missteps, at times slow and precise, or fast and wild and joyous. We did all the steps.
Two nights before Dar died, the family were with us. We all ate dinner together, and Dar sat with us. He hadn't been able to eat for several days. After dinner, I put on a Nat King Cole tape. Dar took me in his arms, weak as he was, and we danced and smiled. No tears for us. We were doing what we had loved to do for more than fifty years. It was our last dance---forever unforgettable. I wouldn't have missed it for the world. 
 Question:The author first danced with Dar when  _  . 
A. they were still in their teens 
B. they began to date each other 
C. they began to share their lives 
D. Dar returned from the South Pacific

Boys who have done best in the classes win scholarships and are sent to the Sunrise Boarding School.About 30 boys have won this kind of financial aid.
As for LaMar Baylor, he knows from his own experience how dance can lead to a better life.He is from Camden, New Jersey.Camden has sometimes been called America's poorest and most dangerous city.He now thanks dancing for saving his life.
The Rwanda program is the largest one set up by the Rebecca Davis Dance Company, and Ms.Davis has also set up dance programs in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Guinea.About 2,000 children in the three countries have taken part in the project since it was begun in 2010.

Context: I have a friend named Monty Roberts who owns a horse ranch . He has let me use his house to put on fund-raising events. The last time I was there he introduced me by saying: ""I want to tell you a story. It all goes back to a story about a young man who was the son of an itinerant horse trainer who would go from stable to stable, race track to race track, farm to farm and ranch to ranch, training horses. As a result, the boy's high school career was continually interrupted. When he was a senior, he was asked to write a paper about what he wanted to be and do when he grew up.
""That night he wrote a seven-page paper describing his goal of someday owning a horse ranch. He wrote about his dream in great detail and he even drew a diagram of a 200-acre ranch, showing the location of all the buildings, the stables and the track. Then he drew a detailed floor plan for a 4,000-square-foot house that would sit on a 200-acre dream ranch.
""He put a great deal of his heart into the project and the next day he handed it in to his teacher. Two days later he received his paper back. On the front page was a large red F with a note that read, 'See me after class.'
""The boy with the dream went to see the teacher after class and asked, 'Why did I receive an F?' The teacher said, 'This is an unrealistic dream for a young boy like you. You have no money. You come from an itinerant family. You have no resources. Owning a horse ranch requires a lot of money. You have to buy the land. You have to pay for the original breeding stock and later you'll have to pay large stud fees. There's no way you could ever do it.' Then the teacher added, 'If you will rewrite this paper with a more realistic goal, I will reconsider your grade.'
""The boy went home and thought about it long and hard. He asked his father what he should do. His father said, 'Look, son, you have to make up your own mind on this. However, I think it is a very important decision for you.' Finally, after a week, the boy turned in the same paper, making no changes at all. He stated, 'You can keep the F and I'll keep my dream.' ""
Monty then turned to the group present and said, ""I tell you this story because you are sitting in my 4,000-square-foot house in the middle of my 200-acre horse ranch. I still have that school paper framed over the fireplace."" He added, ""The best part of the story is that two years ago that same schoolteacher brought 30 kids to camp out on my ranch for a week. When the teacher was leaving, he said, 'Look, Monty, I can tell you this now. When I was your teacher, I was something of a dream stealer. During those years I stole a lot of kids' dreams. Fortunately you had enough courage not to give up yours.' ""
""Don't let anyone steal your dreams. Follow your heart, no matter what,"" Monty at last concluded. 
 Question:Which of the following could best express the teacher's feelings when she said the words before leaving the ranch two years ago? 
A. Regretful and proud. 
B. Regretful and guilty. 
C. Honest and sorry. 
D. Embarrassed and proud. 
 Answer: A
Context: Several years ago ,Masaru Ibuka ,chairman of Sony ,was at a company planning a meeting. Suddenly he hdd a brilliant idea. He stopped the meeting and asked everyone present what would happen if Sony removed the recording function and 'speaker and sold headphones with a tape player instead. Almost everyone thought he was crazy. Still ,Ibuka kept thinking about his idea and worked at improving it The result, of course, turned out to be the wildly successful Sony Walkman.
Good ideas often start with a seemingly silly question. Bill Bowerman was making breakfast one day. As he stood there making waffles  for his son, he wondered what would happen if he poured rubber into his waffle iron. Later ,he tried it and the result looked something Like the bottom of most sports shoes we see today. Still, when he took this idea to several existing shoe companies, he was laughed at In fact, every single company turned him down. Though rather discouraged, Bowerman insisted and went on to form his own company, making NBKE athletic shoes.
Sometime good ideas grow out of frustration  .When Fred Smith was a student at Yale University, he had some paperwork that he needed to have delivered across the country the next day. Smith was amazed to find out that overnight delivery was impossible. He sat for a long while ,lost in thought Why couldn't there be a reliable overnight mail delivery service? He decided to design one. Smith did just that and turned his design into a class project His business professor gave him only a C for his efforts. However, Smith was not through. He improved the idea in that class project and finally turned them into one of the first and most successful overnight mail service in the world -- FedEx.
We know that each of these ideas led to a very successful product or service that has changed the way many of us live. The best questions are usually open-ended and are often silly, Children aren't afraid to ask such questions ,but adults frequently are. Think how different the world might be if people never asked "" silly"" questions! 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? 
A. Sony Walkman achieved great success with its recording function and speaker. 
B. Bill Bowerman was experimenting with rubber for large shoe companies. 
C. Shoe companies rejected Bill Bowerman as they failed to see the potential of Nike.

Context: Sparrow is a fast-food chain with 200 restaurants. Some years ago, the group to which Sparrow belonged was taken over by another company. Although Sparrow showed no sign of declining, the chain was generally in an unhealthy state. With more and more fast-food concepts reaching the market, the Sparrow menu had to struggle for attention. And to make matters worse, its new owner had no plans to give it the funds it required.
Sparrow failed to grow for another two years. Until a new CEO, Carl Pearson, decided to build up its market share. He did a survey, which showed that consumers who already used Sparrow restaurants were extremely positive about the chain, while customers of other fast-food chains were unwilling to turn away from them. Sparrow had to develop a new promotional campaign.
Pearson faced a battle over the future of the Sparrow brand. The chain's owner now favored rebranding Sparrow as Marcy's restaurants. Pearson resisted, arguing for an advertising campaign designed to convince customers that visits to Sparrow restaurants were fun. Such an attempt to establish a positive relationship between a company and the general public was unusual for that time. Pearson strongly believed that numbers were the key to success, rather than customers' speeding power. Finally, the owner accepted his idea.
The campaign itself changed the traditional advertising style of the fast-food industry. The TV ads of Sparrow focused on entertainment and featured original songs performed by a variety of stars. Instead of showing the superiority of a specific product, the intention was to put Sparrow in the hearts of potential customers.
Pearson also made other decisions which he believed would contribute to the new Sparrow image. For example, he offered to lower the rent of any restaurants which achieved a certain increase in their turnover   .
These efforts paid off, and Sparrow soon became one of the most successful fast-food chains in the regions where it operated. 
 Question:What was Pearson's achievement as a CEO? 
A. He managed to pay off Sparrow's debts. 
B. He made Sparrow much more competitive 
C. He helped Sparrow take over a company 
D. He improved the welfare of Sparrow employees

Context: A flock of hungry pigeons were flying across the sky in search of food. Having traveled a long distance, they felt tired and settled down on a tree.  Just below the tree, they saw grains strewn   all over the ground. The pigeons were happy to have found enough food to eat. All the pigeons came down from the tree and started eating the grains. As they were doing so, a huge net fell on them and trapped them all.
The pigeons were taken aback. They noticed a hunter sitting at a distance from the tree, a bow and arrow in hand. The pigeons realized it was the hunter who had trapped them in the net. The hunter got up and began to move towards the pigeons.
The leader of the pigeons spoke, ""Friends, we are in great trouble. The hunter will catch us if we do not act swiftly in a few seconds. There is only one _ available at this moment. Let all of us use our force together and fly up along with the net. If all of us use our force and fly together, we can fly carrying the net along with us. Let us start now.""
All the pigeons agreed with him and flew high carrying the net along with them. After traveling enough distance away from the hunter, the pigeons settled on a tree and carefully came out of the net one by one and thus escaped the evil design of the hunter. 
 Question:Who strewed the grains over the ground? 
A. A villager. 
B. The hunter. 
C. The pigeon. 
D. The writer.

Context: Liverpool city council   want to clear the city of fat pigeons  . They say that people are feeding the birds, which makes them fat. The pigeons get bigger because they normally eat seeds   and insects   for their main food, not high-fat junk food they are eating in the city centre.
The council want people to know that everyone who feeds the pigeons makes the streets crowded  with these birds. They hope to encourage the birds to move away from the city centre and into parks and open spaces.
Ten robotic birds have been brought into the city centre to scare the pigeons away and visitors are asked not to give the pigeons any food. The mechanical birds--known as 'robops'--will sit on the roofs of buildings. They can be moved around to different places. They look like a peregrine falcon, which is a bird that kills pigeons.

Context: He leant down to the pickpocket. The heaving and gasping had stopped, but he was still making a show of his breathlessness.
""That's better,"" Mallon said. ""Can you stand up? Try to stand up. Here,"" he said, and gripped the pickpocket's arm and forced him upright until he saw his face for the first time. As the pickpocket labored for breath, he gazed up at Mallon with his dark eyes. ""How could you?"" they asked.
Mallon might have said, ""Because you tried to steal from me."" But he was still conscious of the flush of joy he'd felt when his blow struck home -- when he knew he'd hurt the man. Where that joy came from he couldn't say, but he knew that its roots were deeper than some clumsy failed theft.
Fat drops of rain began to patter on the awning  .
""How are you?"" Mallon said. ""Can you walk?"" The pickpocket turned away and leant against the store window with both hands, and his head sank lower as his shoulders rose and fell. A gray-haired woman inside the store rapped on the glass and made a shooing motion. When the pickpocket ignored her, she rapped harder and kept rapping.
""I have to go,"" Mallon said. ""I'm sorry."" He looked up at the sky. ""I'm sorry,"" he said again, and stepped into the rain and walked quickly up the street.
One of the Bangladeshi umbrella sellers was working the corner, and Mallon had just paid seven euros when he heard a woman shouting. He didn't want to look back but did. It was the woman from the shop, pushing and batting the pickpocket away from the window while he bent down and covered his head like a boxer trying to get through the last seconds of a round. Mallon slipped his wallet back into his jacket pocket and took the umbrella that the Bangladeshi had opened for him.
The pickpocket was out on the sidewalk now, in the rain. The woman stood just under the awning with her arms crossed over her chest.
""Excuse me, madam,"" Mallon said, coming up to them. ""This man isn't well. He needs to rest a moment.""
""I know these people,"" she said. ""Our Romans don't want them here.""
The rain fell in sheets, ran down the pickpocket's shiny scalp and face, down his leather jacket.
""Here,"" Mallon said, and offered him the umbrella, but he only looked at Mallon with his hurt dark eyes and then lowered his head again. Mallon bumped him in the shoulder with the handle of the umbrella. ""Go on -- take it!"" he said. And finally, with a beaten, unwilling look, the pickpocket did.
And that was when he saw a taxi round the corner with a light glowing on its roof. Mallon ran out waving his arm and the cab turned sharply to the pavement, sending a lot of water over his shoes. He opened the door but couldn't help looking back. The pickpocket had lowered the umbrella to the ground upside down and was leaning on the shaft, head low, neck bared to the sky.
""Wait,"" Mallon said to the driver. He went back and grabbed the pickpocket's sleeve and pulled him to the cab. ""Get in,"" Mallon said, and took the umbrella and pushed him into the back seat. He leaned inside. ""O.K., where do you live?""
""No Gypsies!"" the driver said. He was twisted around, glaring at the pickpocket.
""Gypsy? Look, he's not well. I'll pay,"" Mallon added.
The driver shook his head. ""No Gypsies. Get him out,""
Mallon looked at the driver's nameplate: Michele Kadare. ""It's the law,"" he said, ""If you don't take us, Signor Kadare, I'll report you and you'll lose your license. Believe me -- I am quite serious.""
The driver fastened those pale eyes on Mallon and turned and put his hands on the steering wheel. He raised his eyes to the rearview mirror and he and Mallon exchanged stares.
""O.K., Mr. American,"" he said. ""You pay.""

Context: Canadian experts have found that so - called self - help books may actually do more harm than good to people who really need help.Researchers say that individuals   with low respect felt much worse after repeating positive statements about themselves.
In their study, psychologists Joanne Wood and John Lee sought to determine how positive thinking affected people with different levels of self - confidence.They questioned dozens of people both made and female, analyzed their self - worth and optimism by means of the standard psychological methods and then asked them to write down their thoughts and feelings.The scoring system ranged from 0 to 35.
During the experiment, the researchers asked a total of 68 participants to repeat the self-help book phrase, ""I am a lovable person."" After that they measured the participants' moods and their feelings about themselves.The results revealed that the participants in the low self - respect group who repeated the mantra  , were feeling much worse afterwards, when compared to other participants in low self - respect group who did not repeat the phrase.Those with low self - respect who repeated the phrase scored an average of 10 points.Their counterparts   with equally low self - respect who were not asked to repeat the statement, were able to score a little higher average of 17 points.
However, individuals with high self - respect reported feeling better after repeating the positive self - statement - but only slightly.They scored an average of 31 points, compared with an average of 25 for those with equally high self - respect who did not repeat the phrase.
Professor Wood urged those who promote self - help books, magazines and television shows to stop telling people that simply repeating a positive mantra could change one's life.First, people start following this idea and feel like they are not alone.They are told that all they have to do is just to read that book and then to repeat these positive statements in a hope that things will be better, and when it does not work for them and they realize that nothing gets better, then it is really frustration to people.
Researchers concluded: ""Repeating positive self - statements may benefit certain people such as individuals with high self - respect but discourage the very people who need confidence the most.""

Context: Alice's mother died when Alice was five years old. Alice, who grew up to be my mother, told me that after her mother's death her family was too poor to even afford to give her a doll.
In December 2012, I had a job at a local bank. One afternoon, we were decorating the tree in the bank lobby . One of my customers approached me with her beautiful handmade dolls. I decided to get one for my daughter, Katie, who was almost five years old. Then I had an idea. I asked my customer if she could make me a special doll for my mother--one with gray hair and spectacles : a grandmother doll. And she gladly agreed.
A friend had told me that his dad who played Santa Claus would be willing to make a visit on Christmas morning to our home to deliver my Katie her presents, so I made some special arrangements.
Christmas Day arrived and at the planned time; so did Santa Claus. Katie was surprised that Santa had come to see her at her own house. As Santa turned to leave, he looked once more into his bag and found one more gift. As he asked who Alice was, my mother, surprised at her name being called, indicated that she in fact was Alice. Santa handed her the gift, with a message card that read:
For Alice:
I was cleaning out my sleigh  before my trip this year and came across this package that was supposed to be delivered on December 25,1953. The present inside has aged, but I felt that you might still wish to have it. Many apologies for the lateness of the gift.
Love,
Santa Claus
My mother's reaction was one of the most deeply emotional scenes I have ever seen. She couldn't speak but only held the doll she had waited fifty-nine years to receive as tears of joy ran down her cheeks. That doll, given by ""Santa"", made my mother the happiest ""child"" that Christmas. 
 Question:The best title for this passage could be   _  . 
A. A Doll from Santa 
B. An unforgettable Christmas 
C. A considerate daughter 
D. A help from Santa Claus

The beggar took the money, put it into his pocket, and thanked her a great deal. ""You have saved me from a terrible fate,"" he said. The lady asked him what he meant.

Context: On a cold evening I was waiting for a taxi in New York. About 5 minutes later, I was picked up by a driver, and he said how terrible some people were. I knew there was a part of me that wanted to be silent, but I had to listen out of kindness.
The man told me that he had just come from JFK Airport without a customer. During the taxi ride, what started as anger changed slowly and he mentioned that he had read an article which said that the happiest people are the ones that give, so he hoped he'd have more chance to give in his life. I was really starting to enjoy being with this man.
As we arrived at the place where I wanted to go, I paid my money by credit card. I pulled out an extra $20 and said, ""Sir, since we've been talking about giving this whole time, I want to share that feeling with you. I've already paid my money, but here's an extra little bit. You can tell the next passenger in this taxi that their ride is a gift from another.""
I thought I was pretty cool at this point, but he turned toward me, tears in his eyes, and said, ""Sir, I have a better idea. You give that $20 to a homeless person around here and I will give the next passenger a free ride myself.
It was a great honor meeting that man and learning the lesson of how everyone gives and adds joy to another with their generosity. 
 Question:According to the text, when the author got in the taxi, the driver was  _  . 
A. angry 
B. nervous

Context: In 1987, while serving as the public affairs officer at Fort Bragg, I would frequently visit the local high schools to speak to the students about the Army. As alieutenant colonel , I found it particularly rewarding to talk with the teenagers about the benefits of military service, if only for a few years of their lives.
During one of these visits, I reported to the secretary in the principal's office to let her know that I was here for the third-period class. I was a little surprised when she told me. ""The principal would like to see you before you go to the class.""
As I entered his office, I was greeted by a gentleman who appeared to be in his late thirties, and he welcomed me with a smile and a handshake. ""You don't remember me, do you?"" he said.
I looked closely at the face again and could not recall where we may have met before.
""You were my company commander in basic training at Fort Jackson in 1970,"" the principal said.
""Let me help you out,"" he suggested. ""You gave me a three-day pass to go home and see my newborn baby."" I immediately remembered the incident!
""Yes,"" I said. ""I remember now."" It was the only three-day pass I had issued because the soldiers were on their way to Vietnam immediately after they finished training. But I knew if I did not let him go home to see his son and _ , I would regret denying the opportunity he had to be with his family.
""Come on, Colonel. I'd like to introduce you to 'the baby'. He's in your third-period class. By letting me go see him, you gave me a reason to stay focused and to come home safe from that war. Thank you , sir.""
It was the most rewarding class I had ever given, and I had no problem in telling the students about the bonds of friendship and the values that Army life can provide...and that can last a lifetime. 
 Question:Why did the principal want to see the writer? 
A. He wanted to send his son to the Army. 
B. He felt sorry for causing the writer trouble. 
C. He was disappointed at the writer's lecture.

Context: Melissa and Roman McCoy were looking forward to the Christmas. But on December 5th, Roman got a phone call that changed everything. Melissa had been in a terrible car accident, and the doctor had little hope she would make it.
""He said the next six to eight hours were critical in determining whether she would live or not. And I just wept,"" Roman said. ""A lot of pressure built up inside, and I just dropped my cell phone on the ground when I heard that. It was the worst feeling that I've ever felt.""
Melissa, a college English professor, was on her way to class when her car hit into a mound of dirt and rolled over several times.
Roman recalled, ""I could only think how I am going to raise my kids without their mother. If she did live, how would I take care of her and my kids? The questions you never want to ask yourself, I had to face.""
Melissa survived the first night. She had injuries to her stomach and lungs and worse, she suffered severe injuries to her brain. She didn't recognize anyone, even her own husband.
""Over the next few days, she remained unresponsive to treatments. The brain surgeon never really gave us much hope.""
Days passed and Melissa didn't improve. Christmas Eve, Roman was by her side in the hospital. Then, he received a Christmas gift he would never forget.
""That evening, she woke up and was just as clear as before, recognized everybody, and was able to read. It was just amazing. I saw her bright smile and her sense of humor. The only way I could describe it is that the weight of the darkness that had hovered over me was just completely gone.""
Melissa quickly improved, and she is back to being a wife, mom, and professor. There is no sign of damage from the brain.
Melissa said, ""I thank him for everything now. It's not just 'thank you for my job, thank you for my children.' It's 'thank you for every aspect of my life.'"" 
 Question:What's the relationship between Melissa and Roman? 
A. Mother and son.

Context: Relax. He is the same little boy you loved yesterday. I smiled trying to hold back the tears. ""No, he isn't. Yesterday I dreamed he would be an astronaut. Today I am hoping he will learn to talk.""
It was like some sort of cosmic joke. I could still recall the day that determined my fate. It was October in Ottawa and the summer breezes had given way to the autumn rainfall of leaves. The snow would begin soon. The crispness   of coming frost was in the air. My casually mentioning Wyatt's behavior to Dr. Martin aroused his worries. He started asking me questions about Wyatt's activities speech pattern and emotions. I still see clearly in my mind the cleanness of the room and all its belongings when the doctor turned to me and said, ""He almost sounds autistic   .""
I couldn't face that picture in my mind. I had to run to get away from this all too painful place that was reminding me of what was to be my child's life-being strange.
I could not remember how many times I told myself, ""This is normal. He is a little boy who is not talking yet,"" when my asking questions met with his blank-eyed response in a restaurant; how many times I would tell myself, ""He loves to play on his own for hours at a time and he never gets into trouble,"" when Wyatt was playing games that no one else could imagine, let alone join in while other boys in the park were playing together or in small groups played around a sand pail  or toy truck. My life was changing direction. So was Wyatt's.
I started to hide Wyatt from my friends and neighbor especially from a good friend. It was too painful to let others know about my boy acting strange.
It was a Thursday afternoon and I found one half of a great pair of kitchen scissors was missing. They were unbelievably sharp and could be taken apart so they could be washed or the blades   sharpened. I knew Wyatt had taken the missing blade.
""Wyatt,"" I began as patiently as I could, ""Do you see this?"" I held up the blade. ""Do you know what this is?""
Wyatt put a bunch of Fruit Loops in his mouth. No response.
""Wyatt!"" I forced eye contact with him. ""Where are the other scissors? See these."" I showed him the half pair.
He smiled big. Ate Fruit Loops. Turned the TV on and off. Still no response.
I didn't know what to do. It was really hard. ""Wyatt,"" I tried once more, ""Mommy wants these scissors. Can you go get them for Mommy? It will make Mommy so happy if you bring me the scissors.""
""Watch Spongebob."" Wyatt asked as he slid down from his kitchen stool and ran off, leaving me shaking my head and wondering in exactly which way this situation was going to end badly.
Five minutes later, I turned my head to see Wyatt coming downstairs, his favorite doll in one hand, the missing half pair of kitchen scissors in the other. I immediately ran over and took it from him.
""Wyatt!"" I hugged him. ""Thank you for bringing me the scissors! Good job! You did it! These scissors need to stay in the kitchen. These are Mommy's scissors!""
Wyatt laughed, looked at me straight in the eye and said, ""Mommy so happy!""
I came close to tears. A realization dawned on me that he was the best gift I had ever gotten even though he was not as normal as other children. And why did I hide him from others as if he were some dark and terrible secret. No! He was my pride. It was a long, hard battle to get him to this point, expressing his wants and needs without turning to violence in embarrassment. With love and patience I have found the beautiful, happy boy who would teach me more about life.
And that is the solution. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the following indicates that Wyatt is not normal? 
A. He never gets into trouble 
B. He responds with blank eyes. 
C. He plays with others for hours. 
D. He likes watching TV programmes. 
 Answer: B
Context: After successfully serving their terms for 4 years, military service men and women are given the choice to stay in the military or return to civilian life.
For some, having to readjust to civilian life is one of the most challenging assignments our returning soldiers and marines will ever to undertake. While people may think readjusting should be simple, they must take into consideration all physical and mental stress our servicemen went through.
Post-traumatic Stress Disorder , or PTSD, is a mental disorder that can occur following the experience or witnessing of life-threatening events such as military combat .
Most survivors of trauma return to normal given a little time. In the military, the marines are given a two-week course on how to return to civilian life.
Unfortunately, some will have stress reactions that do not go away on their own, or may even get worse over time. These individual may develop PTSD.
People who suffer from PTSD have difficulty sleeping because they are often reliving the experience through nightmares and flashbacks, and feel deserted or often stand off, and these symptoms can be severe enough and last long enough to significantly damage the person's daily life.

Context: Heather Jack and her family, including her two children, usually spend the Christmas holidays preparing a feast--for others to eat. Last Christmas Eve, they went to a house in the neighborhood and prepared a dinner for an elderly woman and her son, who has muscular dystrophy . They stayed for an hour and chatted before heading home to prepare for a visit from Santa  . 
""I think it is that kind of direct experience that many find so meaningful,"" says Heather, president and founder of The Volunteer Family, a Boston-based organization dedicated to matching families with volunteer opportunities, both during the holidays and year-round. ""It's a great way for parents to involve the kids.""
In a holiday season that stretches from before Thanksgiving to just after the New Year, it's nice to hear stories about people with their children giving instead of receiving. Last December Gary and Debra Danoff and their two teenage sons drove to the Washington, D. C. Jewish Community Center(JCC) and spent Christmas morning in the Center's kitchen preparing a feast for homeless shelters. 
By choosing to prepare meals for the homeless, the Danoffs bring together a belief in community service with their love of cooking, ""It feels good to prepare food with our kids for other people at Christmas,"" says Gary. ""We want them to know that many people don't have the ability to go to the supermarket and pick the foods they want to eat and pay for them.""
The Danoffs were in good company. Across the city, at least 1000 volunteers with their children went across the region to provide food to the poor people as part of the D. C. JCC's annual ""December 25th Day of Service"", now in its 22nd year. 
 Question:What does ""The Volunteer Family"" do? 
A. It matches families with volunteer opportunities. 
B. It supplies food and service to the poor families. 
C. It encourages parents to involve their kids in volunteer work. 
D. It earns much money by organizing volunteer families. 
 Answer: A
Context: Last weekend, my kids along with a few other kids from the neighborhood volunteered to help me wash my car. My 10-year-old daughter came up with the idea of washing other people's cars as well. It was pretty hot outside. She further wanted to give juice for a low cost but not free. I felt happy and decided to help her.
She asked me, ""What if we make this 'a smile car wash', mommy? ""I couldn't hold back my tears and encouraged her and other kids to go inside the house and come up with ideas. While I kept myself busy in drying the car, the kids walked up to me with a board of beautiful signs of smiles. They had ""Free Car Wash"" written on it and the theme of their exercise was ""Smile"". It was pretty natural to see a team of kids 5 to 11 years with the task to do something for others.
All that seemed natural and came right from their heart. Nothing seemed to matter to them: their playtime, and then heat outside--they just wanted to help and do something nice in the community!
I helped them make some fresh juice and brought out some waste materials to help clean cars. Passers-by were amazed and one even shouted at them saying ""Good kids"". One of them even tried giving them 5 dollars, which they refused. A pretty heart-warming scene!
The following weekend, I saw the idea of the week, the theme of which was ""Global Kindness"". I was moved by such wonderful and loving souls. They made me smile!
One of the slogans   on their flag was: ""Do not fear! Smile retrievers  are here.""

Context: Vanilla is my best friend. She is a lovely girl with two big, beautiful eyes. But she always hides them behind a pair of black glasses.
One day, though, I nearly ended our friendship. I remember that day clearly. We were sitting in class. The teacher was giving us our results for a Chinese test. I had done badly. I felt so sad that I wouldn't talk to anyone. At lunchtime, I even stayed in the classroom alone. Suddenly, I heard a voice. It was Vanilla. ""You look very unhappy,"" she said. ""What's wrong?"" I looked up at her, but said nothing. I knew Vallina had got a good mark in the test. I thought she was making fun of me. I stayed silent , but Vallina didn't go away. She kept asking me questions: ""Is it because of the exam? Do you want me to show you the right answers?"" I looked away from her. When I looked up again, Vanilla had gone. And so had my exam paper! I didn't know what to do. I looked everywhere for me paper, but couldn't find it.
In the afternoon, Vanilla came up to my desk and gave me my exam paper back. I looked at it and got a big surprise. Vanilla had written the right answer next to every one of my mistakes. My face went red. Vanilla had been trying to help me all along. How mean I had been to her when she was being so nice. I wanted to hug  her, but all I did was to hold her hands and say, ""Thank you."" That afternoon, Vanilla and I walked home together. I felt so happy that I had to thank her again. We were still best friends.

Context: A TV program was being videoed. Tonight it was to select the sweetest whisper of love ever said between husband and wife.
The final competition was held among 10 married couples. Seven of them were young ones, two middle-aged and one old. The last turn came to the old couple. The old lady took the microphone and said the sweetest whisper of love she had ever heard was: "" Are you standing or sitting?""
The host fixed his eyes on her, quite puzzled by her words.
Regardless of all the talking around, she went on with her story. Her husband had been a doctor before he retired. One day when he was on duty at the hospital, he felt a sharp pain at the heart. By his professional knowledge he knew immediately he suffered a fit of heart attack. His colleagues carried him at once to the operation room and prepared  him for a bypass operation, which was highly risky. The patient's family members had to be informed before it began. The patient himself was allowed to put in a word. Lying silently on the operation table with a trembling hand, he dialed after a moment's thinking of the number of his wife's phone. Finally a familiar voice came from the other end...
""So many years had passed but memory of this incident remained fresh in my mind. What he said in the beginning was: 'Are you standing or sitting?' He was actually worried about me, wondering how I felt at the news. He was afraid I would have fallen flat onto the ground. In such a critical  state as he was then, his thought still went to me..."" The old lady concluded slowly, ""That's the sweetest whisper of love I've ever heard all my life.""
A loud applause followed in the wake of a short silence. 
 Question:which of the following might be the best title for the text? 
A. Are You Standing or Sitting. 
B. True Love Needn't Words. 
C. A Moving TV Program. 
D. An Old Couple's Love Story.

Context: In classes, your teachers will talk about topics that you are studying. The information they provide will be important for you to know when you take tests. You must be able to take good written notes from what your teachers say.
Taking good notes has three stages. There are certain things you should do before class, during class, and after class. Here are the three stages of note-taking and what you should do during each class.

Bring all note-taking materials with you to class - several pens and pencils as well as your notebook.
2. Take Notes
Keep your attention on what your teacher is saying. Paying attention to ""signal statements"". Examples of signal statements are ""The most important point ..."" and ""Remember that ..,"" Be sure to include in your notes information that your teacher repeats or written on the blackboard.
Write quickly so that you can include all the important information in your notes. Do this by writing abbreviated   words such as med for medicine, using symbols such as % for percent, and writing short sentences. Place a ""?"" next to information about whose meaning you are not sure.

Context: ""Mom, you should put some of your things away. The house should be safe for the baby,"" said my son Mark as he walked upstairs with his wife and fifteen-month-old Hannah.
They visited us for the Thanksgiving holiday. After driving all day from Salt Lake to Ft. Collins, his temper showed. ""That one finger rule may work with other kids, but never Hannah,"" he insisted.
When my three granddaughters first moved into our house three years ago, my friend offered me her secret to behave grandchildren. ""Teach them the 'one finger rule'."" All of her five grandchildren learned it at a young age and it proved to also work well with mine. 
I picked up my granddaughter and said, ""Well, Mark, just watch."" I hugged her and walked all around the great room.
""Hannah, you may touch anything in this room you want, but, you can only use one finger."" I showed the technique by touching my forefinger to the sculpture. Hannah followed my example. ""Good girl. Now what else would you like to touch?""
She stretched her finger toward the lamp. I allowed her to touch everything in sight, plants, glass objects, TV, VCR, speakers, etc. If she started to grab , I gently reminded her to use one finger. She always obeyed. However, Hannah, an only child, possessed a more adventurous personality. Her father predicted it would prevent her from accepting the ""one finger rule"".
During their four-day stay, we aided Hannah in remembering ""one finger rule"". She learned quickly. 
Months later, my husband and I drove to Salt Lake. I watched Mark continue to practice the one finger rule. I smiled happily each time he asked Hannah to touch with ""one finger"". 
 Question:How many grandchildren mentioned in the passage have mastered the ""one finger rule""? 
A. 3. 
B. 5. 
C. 8. 
D. 9.

Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""
It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on. 
 Question:That man called after reading about what Jordan did to a disabled child because he wanted to   _  . 
A. become famous himself 
B. know why Jordan appeared in a poor area 
C. let the author know that Jordan was not that nice 
D. offer another example to show that Jordan was a nice man

Context: My friend BJ Gallagher told me a great story recently, about her own experience with resentment  . She once worked as the training manager for a large newspaper, where she found the corporate culture extremely frustrating. The company was a hundred years old and their past success had blinded them to the need for change. Finally, after _ several senior executives   many times, she left the company. But she found that she hadn't left her resentment, frustration, and anger behind when she resigned.
""I finally decided to write about my experiences and my feelings at the newspaper. I wanted to be rid of that company and those people, once and for all. So I wrote and I wrote. It wasn't just a story that poured out; it was a whole book! We called it A peacock in the Land of Penguins. I was the peacock and those newspaper executives were the penguins.""
""It took me several more years to finally get over my negative emotions. Through a lot of soul-searching and reflection, I finally was able to let go of my resentment. I came to see that there was nothing personal in the way they treated me, and they were good people doing what they thought best for the company. I was the one who had made it personal. I thought they were making my life miserable on purpose.""[:Z#xx#k.Com]
""Finally, the time came when I decided to make amends   for the sharp, angry things I had said about the company. I invited my former boss to dinner and made my apology. It was a great healing process for me. I finally felt free of the resentment that had been eating me up.""
""What was the final outcome?"" I asked her.
""Gratitude,"" she replied. ""Not only wasn't I resentful any more, I was grateful to the company. If I hadn't had those painful experiences, I would never have written a book. And the book became hugely successful - now published in 21 languages; it transformed my business."" 
 Question:What made BJ Gallagher frustrated in the company? 
A. Unfair treatment by the senior executives. 
B. The culture and tradition of the company. 
C. The strict rules in the company. 
D. Her low position in the company.

Context: I was waiting in a check-in line at Arlanda International Airport. The man ahead of me was quite a big guy. As an airport baggage handler checked through a customer at the roadside, he accidentally knocked over the man's luggage. He quickly collected the fallen bags and apologized for his mistake. However,the traveler burst into anger, shouting at the baggage handler for his carelessness.
The baggage handler calmly apologized and smiled all the time. The customer continued to berate  the man, even as he turned away and headed for his gate. Through it all the baggage handler smiled and remained calm.
The other customers in line witnessed the incident and admired the baggage handler's professionalism and self-control. ""I have never seen such restraint and humility,"" one of the customers sighed, ""How do you keep your cool when somebody is attacking you so viciously?""
""It's easy,"" the baggage handler answered. ""He's going to London, but his bags are going to Tokyo.""
I won't recommend that we use revenge to relieve stress. But let me tell you about one of my friends who has found a way to go through most of his life unaffected by the _ that disturbs most people. He is one of the calmest people I've ever known and he describes how he keeps his cool no matter how turbulent a situation becomes. He says, ""I look at it this way. A traffic jam has no power to make me angry. It just stops my car. And that's the way I try to look at most of what happens to me."" With that philosophy, this guy goes through life with a calmness I can only envy.
My friend likes to say things like, ""A rude customer has no power to make me angry; he just fusses."" And, ""A mistake I made has no power to make me upset; it's just a chance to do better."" He shows how we can truly find calmness in the midst of chaos. 
 Question:Why does the author tell us about his friend? 
A. To tell us what is true calmness. 
B. To explain a special philosophy. 
C. To show his envy to the friend. 
D. To advise us to have good manners.

Context: One evening after dinner, Mr. and Mrs. Tisich called a family meeting. ""We've had to make a difficult decision,"" Mr. Tisich announced. ""You see, your mother has been offered a post as co-director of a television station in Chicago. Unfortunately, the station is not here. After thinking long and hard about it, we've concluded that the right decision is to move to Chicago."" Marc looked shocked, while his sister Rachel breathlessly started asking when they'd be moving. ""It's surprising, but exciting!"" she said. Marc simply said, ""We can't go--I can't leave all my friends. I'd rather stay here and live with Tommy Lyons!""
The Tisichs hoped that by the time they moved in August, Marc would grow more used to the idea of leaving. However, he showed no signs of accepting the news, refusing to pack his belongings. When the morning of the move arrived, Marc was nowhere to be found. His parents called Tommy Lyon's house, but Mrs. Lyons said she hadn't seen Marc. Mrs. Tisich became increasingly concerned, while her husband felt angry with their son for behaving so irresponsibly.
What they didn't know was that Marc had started walking over to Tommy's house, with a faint idea of hiding in Lyons's attic  for a few days. But something happened on the way as Marc walked past all the familiar landscape of the neighborhood: the fence that he and his mother painted, the tree that he and his sister used to climb, the park where he and his father often took evening walks together. How much would these mean without his family, who make them special in the first place? Marc didn't take the time to answer that question but instead hurried back to his house, wondering if there were any moving cartons the right size to hold his record collection.

A. he did not want to be left behind 
B. he realized his family was important to him 
C. he hoped to reach an agreement with his parents

Context: It was the Year from Hell - the dog died, my marriage of 24 years ended, and my house burned down. I had moved into a new rented house with my youngest son after my husband and I divorced. We'd been in the house just six weeks. I went to a dinner party one night, and as I drove home near, I saw smoke rising into the sky. I wondered whether it was my house. Then I turned the corner, and sure enough, it was my house.
My son and I stayed with a friend for a couple of nights. Then my friend Gail heard about the fire, called me up, and said, ""Come and move into my house. I have seven bedrooms and five bathrooms - plenty of space for you and your son."" Gail had three kids at home, but there was still plenty of room for me and my son, Sutton. Little did I know that her offer of a temporary place to stay would turn into a living arrangement that lasted two and a half years.
We were two single mothers. Gail and I spent the next couple of years sorting out a lot of things together. After we moved in, I soon began to look for a permanent place to live in. Gail said, ""Please don't leave. I've never had so much freedom!"" Having me in the house meant someone to help take care of her kids, someone to share cooking and gardening, and someone to share day-to-day life. She loved having me there, and I loved being there. So we stayed.
It was an important chapter in my life. We both needed time to heal from our divorces. It was a time of deeper insight and spiritual growth for both of us. Gail's generosity was more than anyone could expect from a friend. I am eternally grateful to have a friend like Gail. I'm also grateful for the lessons I learned from the fire and the other losses that came so suddenly, so fast. Much to my surprise, I found gratitude among the ashes. I was tested serious trial by fire. But, like a phoenix, I rose from the ashes strong and whole. I would not be the person I am today if not for that Year from Hell. 
 Question:Which of the following could be the title of the passage? 
A. The Year from Hell. 
B. My Generous Friend - Gail. 
C. Gratitude among the Ashes. 
D. Everything Gone in the Smoke. 
 Answer: C
Context: What is a library for? Most libraries have books and other things to read. Many of them have things to listen to. Some libraries even have computers. Very few people would think of a library as a place to live in.

A. the library was kept open at last

With no worries about money or work or responsibilities, she goes off, passing through the lives of various interesting people while telling anyone willing to listen that she's trying to find herself and get over the end of her marriage, which she gave up and immediately turned to another man to get over, who she then gave up on fairly quickly for no apparent reason.

Context: When John Weston awoke that morning, he remembered that his mother was going into hospital. He hadn't worked out quite what was wrong with her. He knew, though that she hadn't been well for some time now, and it had become almost familiar to him to see her eyes narrowed in a sudden attack of pain, and her hand pressing against her heart. Their own doctor, who she had finally gone to for advice, had sent her to an expert who knew all about these things. He had told her that just as soon as there was a bed for her, she would have to come into his hospital where he could look after her himself.
During the weeks since then the pains had come even more frequently, and the narrowed eyes became an almost permanent part of her expression. Always rather sharp, she began losing her temper over little things so that John's father kept his thoughts to himself more and more. John, as ready as possible to make allowances, tried to think what it would be like to have toothache all the time and how bad-tempered that would make you.
So his mother would go into hospital for a few days. He was going to stay with his Aunt Daisy till she came back, and his father would stay on at home by himself. John's cousin, Mona, was to come in and make the bed and wash the pots and dust round now and again. That was the arrangement, and John didn't care much for it. Apart from missing his mother(and he was glad she was going away because they would make her better), he wasn't very fond of his Aunt Daisy because she was even more bad-tempered than his mother. 
 Question:Mrs Weston went to see her doctor  _  . 
A. as soon as she realized that something was wrong 
B. only after her husband advised her to 
C. a long time after the trouble began 
D. when John asked what was wrong with her

Context: Jane was running late. Jane, 25, had a lot to do at work, plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Jane felt weak and tired---maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks.
Several yards away, Tom, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying.
But when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, ""Oh, my God, she fell in!"" Tom didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. ""No! Not you!"" his girlfriend screamed after him.
She was right to be alarmed. By the time Tom reached Jane, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station.
It was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the grins and drag her away from the edge. That was where Jane briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse.
Jane thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in.
Police and fire officials soon arrived, and Tom told the story to an officer. Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40-minute train ride downtown-just as he had been seconds after the rescue, which made her think about her reaction at the time. ""I saw the train coming and I was thinking he was going to die,"" she explained. 
 Question:Why did Jennifer try to stop her boyfriend? 
A. Because they would miss their train. 
B. Because he didn't see the train coming. 
C. Because she was sure Jane was hard to lift. 
D. Because she was afraid the train would kill him.

Context: Remember those big, colorful books with large pictures of balls or apples when you were a little kid? Those have proven to be helpful, according to a number of studies. Between 1 and 5 years old, introducing books to Children can help greatly because this is usually the age when intellectual   capabilities form.
At age 1 to 5, a child can decide whether he wants to learn or wants to be a good learner. The road to learning starts here. Their curiosity   and imagination are fed with the many pictures, sounds and colors in the books.
Children normally began school at 5 years old. But today, they go to school when they are as young as one and a half years old. This is because many parents have recognized that influencing the child's formative years   is very important. The fight influence can make the child want to read in the future.
Parents should play a part in encouraging children to read. Even just reading them bedtime stories can help children feel the joy and amazement connected to reading. This can help them become better readers and better learners as they grow older.
If children are interested in reading books rather than watching television, they can improve many skills besides reading and learning. Books can act as stepping stones to intelligence. However, parents must be very careful not to overpower their children. If they force children to read books that are too hard to understand, they might think reading is boring and lose interest in it. 
 Question:. This passage mainly   _  . 
A. advises kids to spend less time watching TV 
B. explains why reading is good for us 
C. tells us that reading is good for children 
D. suggests that parents spend more time with their kids

Context: Do you enjoy reading? Do you read newspapers or magazines? Chances are, if you do any of these activities, your pre-school child is on his way to becoming a reader.
The process of learning to read is complex, and one of the most important things to know is that parents can help their children learn to read. As children have conversations with adults, they hear both new and familiar words and their vocabulary grows.
There are many opportunities for adults and children to talk together, such as when riding in the car or in a bus, doing housework like fixing dinner, or bathing and getting ready for bed. A major part of conversation is listening. When children talk, adults listen and respond. Then children listen and respond, and so the flow of conversation happens.
Have you watched you pre-school child pretend to read to his younger sisters or brothers? Have you read his favorite story over and over? These experiences tell children that reading is fun. And when things are fun and they are repeated, your child will see letters. He begins to connect them to familiar words, especially the letters that make up his name. A natural next step for him to take is to write the letters.
When children see parents make a grocery list, they want to use a pencil and paper to make their own list. To encourage these beginning writing activities, have pencils, markers, crayons and scrap paper within your children's reach.
The more children get connected with talking, listening, reading and writing, the easier it is for them to become active readers. While you as a parent have a big influence on these early behaviors, it is important to remember that opportunities for literacy experiences happen when you and your child share in the basic routines of everyday life. 
 Question:During the process of learning to read, children may   _  . 
A. copy the action of the adults. 
B. prefer to talk with those of their own age. 
C. show no interest in reading at all. 
D. waste a lot of paper and other materials. 
 Answer: A

Context: Autumn and winter are cold and flu seasons. Will the old advice about dressing warmly help prevent a cold, or if you get sick, should you follow the old saying, ""feed a cold and starve a fever?"" And what about that fever? Should you take medicine to reduce your temperature, or is it better to let the body treat the fever itself? Everyone seems to have an answer. But is popular wisdom valuable?
Doctor Nelson knows a lot about cold and flu seasons. Nelson says research may be just starting to provide proofs for long-held beliefs. For example, scientists for years were against the idea that getting cold and wet might cause colds or flu. But recent studies have shown that cold temperatures cause stress on the body, and that stress can create conditions more inviting to viruses. So maybe it does make sense to wrap up warmly before going outside.
And what about feeding a cold and starving a fever? Nelson says if you have a cold and are hungry, you should eat. But a fever, especially a high one, suggests a more serious problem. He says people are usually not hungry when they have a high fever. Eating might even make a person sick. But drinking enough water is important. A fever easily makes the body lose water.
Finally, when should you treat a fever? Nelson says a fever should be treated if it stays at
40degC or above for a day or more. A high temperature can damage brain cells. The doctor also believes in treating a fever if it prevents a person from sleeping.
Medicine like aspirin, for example, can be used to reduce pain and fever. But aspirin should not be given to children because it can cause serious problems. 
 Question:According to Doctor Nelson, if someone catches a fever, he should  _  . 
A. bathe in cold water 
B. drink enough water 
C. try to eat something 
D. take some exercise outside 
 Answer: B
Context: It will be hot--hot enough that most locals will have cleared town for cooler places. But because athletes competing at the 2004 Olympics have no choice but to stay in the hot weather, many plan to turn to science to stay cool.
Some will put their hands in ice water just before competing and nearly all will be wearing fabrics  designed with hot weather in mind.
""Normally we warm up before exercise,""said Gordon Sleivert, director of sports science and medicine at the Canadian Sport Center in Victoria, British Columbia.""But in this case we're taking the warm out of warm up. It's like pre-cooling.""
Experts are predicting  the average high this August in Athens will be 90 degrees Fahrenheit, with temperatures often reaching above 100(the average temperature in Sydney for the 2000 summer games was 64).
Although some events, such as the marathon, will start early(1 a.m.) to avoid hot weather, _        Drinking lots of water will help athletes keep cool, but humidity  remains a problem. The body's ability to cool down is weakened by damp air since sweat drips off the skin rather than evaporates ,resulting in dehydration  without the cooling.
""Getting hot is a real problem because when our brains heats up, the brain waves are more like when you're really sleepy. Everything feels harder,"" said Sleivert. 
 Question:The passage mainly tells us that   _  . 
A. why it is very hot in Athens 
B. the hot weather is a big problem for Olympic athletes 
C. how important science is to every athlete 
D. the Olympics will be put off because of the hot weather 
 Answer: B
Context: People are busy working every day, so they do not have enough time to do exercise. As a result, many people become too fat or too thin. To keep our bodies healthy, we have to do exercise every day.
There are many kinds of exercises. Bending   and stretching   helps us move easily. Before we play ball games or swim, it is better for us to do bending and stretching exercises first. This kind of exercise is something called warm-up exercise.
Running is also a good exercise.  If we cannot run fast, we can jog. Jogging means running slowly Again, before we run or jog, we must do warm-up exercise. Also, we should not run or jog in busy streets. The air there is often dirty. Some people like weight lifting because it can make their bodies strong. Also, we need to do warm-up exercise before weight lifting. 
 Question:From the passage, we know   _   . 
A. jogging means running quickly 
B. weight lifting can help us move easily 
C. busy streets are not good places for running 
D. three kinds of exercises are mentioned 
 Answer: C
Context: The Body Temperature
The temperature of your body should be always just the same, no matter whether the weather is hot or cold. That is why the doctor uses his thermometer  when your are sick.
The body keeps the same temperature all the time ,because it balances the heat it produces and it gives off. It is always burning up food and , producing heat. It can produce heat faster when it needs to give off heat than when it becomes too warm. Let's see how this happen.
The heat of your body is given off mainly through the skin. When you are cold, your skin is tight and shows ""good flesh"". When you get chilly, you must dance around to keep warm or else you will shiver. Then your muscles begin to work, burn up fuel, and produce more heat. It is not pleasant to shiver, so you usually prefer to warm up by exercise, or put on more clothes to keep heat in.
When you are warm, the skin is loose and soft. It is so supplied with blood that heat is given off rapidly. If you get too warm, you begin to sweat ,and more body heat is used in evaporating the moisture  from your skin. You wear less clothing, too, in warm weather or warm room, so that warm can be given off freely. You feel less like exercising because your body is warm already, and the extra heat produced by exercise makes you uncomfortable.
You can see from the way you feel differently in different kinds of weather. In summer, when it is warm, you feel tired and lazy. You do not care to work or play, but enjoy lying and doing nothing. When you get out of doors in winter, the cold air makes you feel lively. You want to play. 
 Question:When one feels chilly, which of the following will he do? 
A. His skin becomes tight in order to keep warm. 
B. He does exercises to make his muscle produce more heat. 
C. He puts on more clothes to keep heat in. 
D. He keeps shivering to produce more heat.

Context: There is a big question making the rounds  among the parents at my daughter's class. Should the kids refer to the parents' friends as ""Mr. Jones"" or ""Mrs. Smith"", rather than using their first names? I was quite shocked, having come from a home where it would have been unheard of to refer to one of my parents' friends by their first names. This was reserved for only the closest of family friends and  s, and even they always had ""Aunt"" or ""Uncle"" in front their name.
    Respect is something that is earned. Unlike many of the other virtues we try to nurture in our kids, respect is a bit more complicated. It is not only necessary when dealing well with others, but the virtue of self-respect is critical for kids to succeed and feel good about themselves and their choices throughout their lives.
    There are several factors that can have a big impact on kids and their ability to be respectful. The first one to consider is manners. Calling adults by their surnames, setting proper examples during sporting events and while driving, and how we talk to each other in our homes all can have an enormous effect on a child's concept of respect and how important it is. Many of these seemingly trivial ideas have become almost outdated, but one should seriously consider the value of these ideas before casting(          ) them aside. It is easy to become unaware of these behaviors. Try to keep track of how often your child is subjected to  this kind of disrespect.
    The media, as you may have guessed, plays a large part in the increase in disrespect. Movies are equally to blame, with a PG movie often containing an abundant amount of  _ language.
    These factors and others all contribute to an alarming increase in disrespect in society. If we don't step in and change course, we will find living in a morally respectful culture unlikely. 
 Question:What does the author think of kids' referring to parents' friends by their first names? 
A. It is common in his family. 
B. It is OK if the friends are close. 
C. Such behavior lacks respect. 
D. Such behavior sounds funny. 
 Answer: C
Context: My son was a second-grader. He went to school by bus every day. He was the first student on in the morning, as we were farthest from school, and the last student off in the evening. I was a teacher myself and it was a comfort to realize the school staff   were all working as hard as I was to provide a safe learning environment.
One day I came home from work and waited for my son to get home for a long time. Then I called the school. ""Perhaps he's just a bit late,"" said the secretary. ""I will call the driver to see if those children are home."" A few minutes later, I answered the phone to hear that the other students were home. Then I called his friends' parents, to see if perhaps he had gotten off at their stop to play. The answers were all ""No.""
By that time, it was dark and I was scared. My home was in the mountain areas, and it was said that a wolf had come up somewhere. My husband wasn't at home, so I forced myself to calm down and decided to go out to look for him. I was about to go out when the telephone rang; it was from the driver. ""He's okay,"" I heard. ""He was asleep on the seats in the back, under a couple of jackets. Since it's dark, can he spend the night with my family?""
I was relieved and agreed. Since my son had a great adventure, the school started giving a copy of the list to the driver, so he could check off the children's names when they got off the bus. I think highly of the school for taking the cautionary   step ahead; it is a sign of their concern for students, parents, and staff. 
 Question:The author's son probably spent the night   _  . 
A. in the bus 
B. at his own home 
C. at the driver's home 
D. in the secretary's office

Context: Steve knew he'd been adopted as a baby, and when he turned 18, in 2003, he decided he'd try to track down his birth mother. The agency from which he'd been adopted gave him his mother's name: Tallady. But online searches didn't turn up any results about it, and Steve had to let it go.
In 2007, though, he searched for the name again online. This time, the search results included a home address near the Lowe's store where Steve, then 22, worked as a deliveryman. When he mentioned the coincidence to his boss, his boss said, ""You mean Tallady, who works here?""
Steve and Tallady, a cashier, had said hello to each other a few times at the store, but they'd never really talked. He hadn't even known her name. Steve thought there was no possible way she was his mother though they shared the same name. For a few months, Steve avoided Tallady. ""I wasn't sure how to approach her,"" he told a local reporter. Finally, the agency volunteered to arrange their reunion.
When Tallady realized that the nice guy she'd been waving at was his son, she sobbed. She'd always hoped to meet her birth son one day. Later that day, mother and son talked for almost three hours at a nearby bar. She'd given him up for adoption in 1985, when she was 23. ""I wasn't ready to be a mother,"" she told him. Married with two other children, Tallady says, ""I have a complete family now.""

Context: ""But what if I break my arm again?"" my 5-year-old daughter asked. I knew how much she wanted to learn to ride. Yet ever since she'd fallen off her bike and broken her arm, she'd been afraid.
""Oh honey,"" I said. ""I don't think you'll break another arm.""
""But I could, couldn't I?""
""Yes,"" I admitted, and found myself struggling for the right thing to say. ""I don't think I want to ride,"" she said and got off her bike.
We walked away and sat down beside a tree.
""Don't you want to ride with your friends?"" I asked. ""And I thought you were hoping to start riding your bike to school next year,"" I added.
""I was,"" she said in a low voice.
""You know, honey,"" I said. ""Most everything you do comes with dangers. You could break your arm at gymnastics. Do you want to stop going to the gym?"" ""No, of course not!"" she replied. And with a determined spirit, she stood up and agreed to try again. I held on to the back of her bike until she found the courage to say, ""Let's go!""
I spent the rest of the afternoon at the park watching a very brave little girl overcome a fear, and congratulating myself for being an independent single parent.
As we walked home, pushing the bike as we made our way along the sidewalk, she asked me about a conversation she'd overheard me having with my mother the night before.
""Why were you and Grandma arguing last night?""
""It's nothing."" I told her.
She shrugged  . ""Grandma said she just wanted you to find someone to love.""
""What Grandma wants is for some guy to break my heart again,"" I snapped.
""But Mom ...""
""You're too young to understand."" I told her.
She was quiet for the next few minutes. Then she looked up and in a small voice said, ""So I guess love isn't like a broken arm.""
Unable to answer, we walked the rest of the way in silence. When I got home, I let go and agreed to meet a man called Steve.
Steve was the man for me. We married less than a year later. It turned out my mother and my daughter were right.

Context: On Nov.18,1995,Itzhak Perlman,the violinist,came on stage to give a concert at Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center in New York City.
If you have ever been to a Perlman concert, _ him.He was stricken with polio as a child,and so he has braces on both legs and walks with the aid of two crutches .
He walks painfully, yet majestically, until he reaches his chair.Then he sits down,slowly, puts his crutches on the floor, undoes the clasps on his legs,tucks one foot back and extends the other foot forward.Then he bends down and picks up the violin, puts it under his chin,nods to the conductor and proceeds to play.
But this time,something went wrong.Just as he fmished the first few bars ,one of the strings on his violin broke.You could hear it snap ---it went off like gunfire across the room.There was no mistaking what that meant.There was no mistaking what he had to do.
We figured that he would have to get up,put on the clasps again,pick up the crutches and limp his way off stage-to either find another violin or else find another string for this one.But he didn't.Instead.he waited a moment,closed his eyes and then signaled the conductor to begin again.
The orchestra began,and he played from where he had left off.And he played with such passion and such power and such purity as they had never heard before.
When he finished, there was an awesome silence in the room.And then people rose and cheered.He smiled,wiped the sweat from this brow, raised his bow to quit us,and then he said in a quiet tone.""You know, sometimes it is the artist's task to find out how much music you can still make with what you have left.'' 
 Question:When one of the strings broke,people thought Itzhak Perlman would  _  . 
A. go on playing with the remaining three strings 
B. give up playing 
C. change or repair his violin

Context: It was evening rush hour on Pacific Coast Highway in Redondo Beach, CA. Drivers lined up from traffic signal to traffic signal and were anxious to get home. On a side street merging   into this highway was a timid driver who was afraid to edge in and no one let her in. Some of the drivers backed up behind her and loudly blasted their horns. This made her more upset and nervous. 
On the right of this side street, the signal on Pacific Coast Highway turned red and traffic stopped. A driver who saw what was happening to this woman stopped a few car lengths behind her car and motioned to her to pull in front of his car. She quickly did and as he waited, two more cars dashed in behind her car. 
While the woman he'd helped waited for the signal to turn green, she sank into her driver's seat and was deeply relieved. Although this thoughtful man couldn't see it, her body language expressed her gratitude.
If you've been in a traffic situation like the one she was in, you know how upsetting it can be. But this little act of kindness allowed her to safely reach her home. She told others about this, which encouraged them to do something nice for someone else. 
This kindness spreads. Someone does something nice for you and in turn you're likely to do something nice for that person or for someone else. 
A simple act of kindness could have a widespread effect. It's like a stone that drops in a pond and causes ripples in each direction. No one knows how far those ripples will travel but they will affect everything they touch along the way. 
 Question:What can we know about most of the drivers on Pacific Coast Highway from the story? 
A. They were not friendly or thoughtful. 
B. They are thankful to the driver who helped the lady. 
C. They blasted their horns to encourage the lady driver. 
D. They were not anxious to get home.

Context: ""Linda, if beating yourself up were an Olympic sport, you'd win a gold medal!""
Annabel, my close friend, stunned(...)me with that frank observation after I told her how I had mishandled a situation with a student in a third-grade class where I was substituting . ""I should never have let him go to the boy's room without a pass! It was my fault he got into trouble with the hall monitor! I'm so stupid!""
My friend burst out laughing, and then made her ""Olympic"" comment. After a brief period of reflection I had to admit that she was right. I did put myself down an awful lot. Why, just during the previous day I had called myself ""a slob"" for having some papers spread out on my desk, ""ugly"" when I left the house without makeup and ""an idiot"" when I left the house for an emergency substitute job without my emergency lesson plan.
In a more reflective tone, Annabel said, ""I once took a workshop at church where the woman in charge had us list all the mean things we say about ourselves.""
""How many did you have on your list?"" I asked.
""Fifteen,"" she confessed. ""But then the teacher said, 'Now turn to the person next to you and say all the items on your list as if you were speaking to that person!' ""
My jaw dropped,""What did you do?""
""Nothing. Nobody did. We all just sat there, until I said, 'I could never say these things to anyone else!' ""
""And our teacher replied, 'Well, if you can't say them to anyone else, then don't ever say them to yourself!' ""
My friend had a point. I would never insult a child of God---and I'm God's child, too!

Context: Most Americans don't like to get advice from their family. When they need advice, they don't usually ask people they know. They often write letters to newspapers and magazines. And these newspapers and magazines can give advice on many different subjects such as family problems, language learning and how to buy a house and so on.
Most newspapers publish   letters from readers with problems. And they would also publish the answers to the letters. There are many writers giving advice to newspapers. Some of these writers are doctors, and some are teachers or lawyers . One of the best writers is a woman. Although she doesn't have special learning for this kind of work, experience helps her a lot to give advice. She is named Angel. She started writing advice for newspapers at the age of ten. Her advice to young readers now is in acolumn   called DEAR ANGEL in the Philadelphia Bulletin.

Context: From my first day, I was attending press conferences and other media events all over town. I got to attend events at places I had never thought I'd get to: the White House, the Senate and House of Representative buildings at the Capitol  , the Department of Health and Human Services, just to name a few. And I was sent to cover these events as if I were a reporter, not just an intern   .
In fact, I never really felt like an intern. I was given the opportunity to do the work that everyone else at the paper was doing. I covered stories on my own and wrote the articles myself. I was included in discussions for story ideas. I helped to edit the articles that went into the paper. I was able to take part in every aspect of the newspaper that I wanted to experience.
The best part of working at the Nation's Health was the staff. They were supportive in letting me go out and do things on my own, while I always knew that they would be more than happy to answer any questions or help me with any problems I might have. Best of all, they treated me as their equal, not just an intern whom they could get to do all the work they didn't want to do.
After interning at the Nation's Health for nearly seven months and having more than 30 articles published, I had to move on. My experience there gave me insight into how the media work, which helps me when I'm trying to choose stories. In addition, it showed me that work really can be fun. 
 Question:What did the author think of her experience of working at the Notion's Health? 
A. Meaningful 
B. Disappointing 
C. Tiring 
D. Surprising

Context: Robert had just moved into the street and he felt strange that he was not wanted. He knew that perhaps the other boy students were trying to get an idea of what kind of a boy he was. This did not help to make him less lonely. He was new and he had to be tested. Still, proving himself would not be all that easy. He did not want to run with bad boys or get into something against the law to prove that he was strong. No! He must show what he was made of in a more helpful way. That would be better when he got the idea.
The next day was Saturday. He knew that most of the boys would be down on the playground and choose up sides for the Saturday game. Robert knew he could play well and that just might be enough to prove he was strong and to make friends with them. He arrived early and did his step exercises. He shot the ball several times and did some other exercises--the most difficult and most wonderful in basketball. Then the boys came. Robert went through what he had done before the game and showed what he could do.
No one said a word. The boys just looked at each other and thought about it. In the end, when it was all over, the biggest of the group just smiled and shook his head. Robert knew he had made it. 
 Question:When did Robert decide to prove himself by playing basketball? 
A. After he had thought about the two wrong ways. 
B. Long before he moved into the street. 
C. When the other boys came down to the playground. 
D. As soon as he showed what he was made of in front of the other boys.

Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""
It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on.

A. become famous himself 
B. know why Jordan appeared in a poor area 
C. let the author know that Jordan was not that nice 
D. offer another example to show that Jordan was a nice man

Context: Last summer, when Amanda R of Anaheim Hills, California, was running on a cross-country course with her team, she blacked out. ""I got really dizzy,"" she says. ""I was out for a few minutes."" At first, Amanda thought she was just tired and didn't think she had a health problem. She did go to the emergency room, where she was fine after tests, but she fainted   again several days later as she was talking with her coach. Another doctor guessed that Amanda had blacked out ""because we were in heat so much with not enough water and not enough of the right kind of foods"".
Teens often don't want to stop and take a break or don't notice when they start to feel bad, doctors say. However, paying attention if you're not feeling well is important, as Amanda learned.
As a result, Amanda has changed her habits. ""I drink a lot more water,"" she says. ""And put more salt in my diet. I'm eating more balanced meals."" Amanda advises teen athletes to trust their coaches and speak up when they're not feeling well. ""And recognize the difference between when you're tired and when there's something really wrong.""
Some people - up to 3 percent of the population - sweat too much, even in cold weather. The condition, called hyperhidrosis  , can affect many parts and it often runs in families - hands down from generation to generation. Too much sweating over the whole body could be a symptom of another medical condition. Doctors aren't sure what causes hyperhidrosis, but using special medications or other treatments can help. 
 Question:What can we infer from Paragraph 4? 
A. There is no need to worry when sweating too much, even in cold weather. 
B. Hyperhidrosis may have a bad effect on your health. 
C. Doctors have discovered why people get hyperhidrosis. 
D. Hyperhidrosis is a serious disease and no treatment can help. 
 Answer: B
Context: Don't worry, be happy and, according to new research, you will also be healthy. It is estimated that over the course of one year, Americans suffer 1 billion colds. But new research shows that all it may take to avoid this common affliction is a positive and upbeat attitude.
         People who are energetic, happy and relaxed are less likely to catch a cold than those who are depressed, nervous or angry, finds a new study published in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine. Healthy volunteers first underwent an emotional assessment in which they were asked to rate their tendency to experience positive and negative emotions--how often they felt pleased, relaxed, happy, or anxious, depressed and hostile. The subjects were next given a squirt up the nose of a rhinovirus, the nasty little germ that causes colds.
         Researchers then watched the volunteers to see who came down with a cold and waited to see how the unlucky ill manifested their cold symptoms. ""We found that people who regularly experience positive emotions, when exposed to rhinovirus, are  ly protected from developing illness,"" said Dr. Sheldon Cohen, lead author of the study and a psychology professor at Carnegie Mellon University."" Increases in positive emotional styles were linked with decreases in the rate of clinical colds, but a negative emotional style had no effect on whether or not people got sick,"" Cohen said.
         So how can your emotions influence your health? In simple terms, when the brain is ""happy"" it sends messages to our organs that help keep the body healthy and sound."" It's like a drug that is released by your state of mind and simply changing the state of mind can produce effects on the rest of the body through the nervous system and hormones,"" said Dr. Neil Shulman, associate professor of medicine at Emory University School of Medicine and author of Doc Hollywood. ""Your chance of developing the common cold, pneumonia, or even cancer may very well be decreased by keeping your brain in a healthy state.""
         In addition, happy and relaxed people tend to better health practices than their negative and stressed counterparts. They are more likely to get plenty of sleep and to engage in regular exercise, and have been shown to have lower levels of certain stress hormones. 
 Question:The experiment states that   _ 
A. positive people show a greater resistance to colds.

Context: Zoe Chambers was a successful PR(Public Relations) consultant and life was going well--she had a great job, a beautiful life in London. Then one evening in June last year, she received a text message telling her she was out of work. ""The first two weeks were the most difficult to live through,"" she said. ""After everything I'd done for the company, they dismiss me by text! I was so angry and I just didn't feel like looking for another job. I hated everything about the city and my life.""
Then, Zoe received an invitation from an old school friend, Kathy, to come and stay. Kathy and her husband, Huw, had just bought a farm in north west Wales. Zoe jumped at the chance to spend a weekend away from London, and now, then months later, she is still on the farm.
""The moment I arrived at Kathy's farm, I loved it and I knew I wanted to stay."" said Zoe. ""Everything about my past life suddenly seemed meaningless.""
Zoe has been working on the farm since October of last year and says she has no regrets. ""It's a hard life, physically very tiring."" she says. ""In London I was stressed and often mentally exhausted. But this is a good, healthy tiredness. Here, all I need to put me in a good mood is a hot bath and on of Kathy's wonderful dinners.""
Zoe says she has never bored on the farm. Every day brings a new experience. Kathy has been teaching her how to ride a horse and she has learnt to drive a tractor.

Context: A gentle breeze blew through Jennifer's hair. The golden red sun was setting. She was on the beach, looking up at the fiery   ball. She was amazed by its color1, deep red in the middle, softly fading into yellow. She could hear nothing but the waves and the seagulls flying up above in the sky.
The atmosphere relaxed her. After all she had been through, this was what she needed. ""It's getting late,"" she thought, ""I must go home. My parents will be wondering where I am.""
She wondered how her parents would react, when she got home after the three days she was missing. She kept on walking, directing herself where she spent every summer holiday. The road was deserted. She walked slowly and silently. Just in a few hundred meters she would have been safe in her house.
It was really getting dark now. The sun had set a few minutes before and it was getting cold, too. She wished she had her favorite sweater on-- it kept her really warm. She imagined having it with her. This thoughtdisappeared when she finally saw her front door. It seemed different. Nobody had taken care of the outside garden for a few days. She was shocked: her father was usually so strict about keeping everything clean and tidy, and now... It all seemed deserted. She couldn't understand what was going on.
She entered the house. First, she went into the kitchen where she saw a note written by her father. It said, "" Ellen, there is some coffee ready. I went looking."" Ellen was her mother but -- where was she? On the right side of the hallway was her parents' room. She went in. Then she saw her. Her mother, lying on the bed, was sleeping. Her face looked so tired, as if she hadn't slept for days. She was really pale. Jennifer would have wanted to wake her up but she looked too tired. So Jennifer just fell asleep beside her. When Jennifer woke up, something was different... she wasn't in her mother's room and she wasn't wearing the old clothes she ran away in. She was in her  _ bed in her pajamas .
It felt so good being back home. Suddenly she heard a voice, ""Are you feeling better now, ? You know you got us very, very scared."" 
 Question:Her father didn't take care of the garden because   _  . 
A. he was busy looking for her 
B. he had to look after his wife 
C. he was not strict in his job 
D. he no longer enjoyed working there

Context: Most students, when asked about their ideal graduation gift, would probably reply, ""A car"", or ""Money for a deposit on a house"". Cai Kaiyuan, 21, made a different choice. As a graduation gift to himself, he decided to work as a volunteer teacher in a remote village in Tibet.
Cai, a senior majoring in electrical engineering at Huan Railway Professional Technology College, originally planned to cycle from Sichuan to Tibet. During his journey, Cai's idea for a different graduation gift to himself began to take shape. ""I did not know beforehand what the journey would mean to me. I just want to gain a unique experience and have pleasure in appreciating the view there,"" he said.
It turned out cycling on a plateau was extremely challenging. And it has kept changing his outlook on life. Cai's fingers even became frostbitten while cycling up a 5008-meter-high mountain, where temperatures often dropped to 18 below zero. At night, the ice covered the road and he fell off his bike three times. The lack of oxygen made him feel dizzy and weak. ""At the most serious moment, I felt that my life was _ ,"" said Cai.
However, he also gained something unexpected. At Ya'an, a city in Sichuan, he met a group of tourists who are also university students. A girl called Wu Ling told him that she planned to work as a teacher in a primary school in Tibet after her journey. He was impressed by the idea as she looked slender and weak.
It was not until he reached a family-run hotel in Shigatse that Cai's spirits began to rise. The hotel manager's two daughters enjoyed talking with him. The kids asked about his experiences on his trip, and showed him the beautiful local lakes. ""They told me that they always liked to talk to guests, as they wanted to improve their Mandarin,"" he said, ""Their parents and many locals can only speak Tibetan.""
Cai was touched by the girls' story. Their situation is tough and the local people have little chance to learn Mandarin because the schools are short of teachers. ""I want to do something to improve the situation for kids like them,"" said Cai. His parents finally gave their agreement and his teachers also supported him. 
 Question:According to the passage, Cai Kaiyuan's graduation gift to himself is   _  . 
A. to have money for a deposit on a house 
B. to travel by cycling from Sichuan to Tibet 
C. to own a new car and marry a slender girl 
D. to work as a volunteer teacher in Tibetan school

Context: Answers to life can be found in everyday events. Watching nature, watching people and watching animals communicate with each other provide some of the simplest ways to life's biggest problems.
This became clearer to me yesterday. It caused me to ask myself, ""How do I respond   to the storms in life?""
People usually run when it starts to rain. I love to walk in it, stand on my front door and feel it. I grew up doing it and have never really felt the fear many people do.
The animal world senses changes in the weather far earlier than humans. My dog, Ricky, begins to shake long before the storm is close enough to be noticed. I was about to feed my three dogs yesterday and as usual, I let them out in the yard first. They didn't move when thunder came across the skies. So I placed their food in their bowls and called Ricky into the kitchen.
Ricky was just standing there in place next to his bowl. The thunder became louder, which forced him to stop eating his meal. Then I watched Phil. He made his way across the kitchen floor and stood over Ricky's bowl. He ate all the remaining food. Generally, if Ricky was standing there, he wouldn't dare   come close. But today, he took advantage   of the storm and got what he wanted. His hope for the prize outweighed   his fear of the storm.
That's when it hit me. As men, we face all kinds of storms. They come in unannounced. Sometimes we stay in a corner or under the blankets, hoping it will all pass. However, if you dare put your head out, you'll discover there're people doing what they must to get what they must have out of life. Isn't it time you decided to take advantage of the storm?

B. lie around us

D. make people become fearless

Context: Linda was kind of late. Linda, 25, had a lot to do at work, plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Linda felt weak and tired -- maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks.
Several yards away, Frank, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying.
But when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, ""Oh, my God, she fell in!""Frank didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. ""No ! Not you ! ""his girlfriend screamed after him.
She was right to be alarmed. By the time Frank reached Linda, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station.
It was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the arms and drag her away from the edge. That was where Linda briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse.
Linda thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in.
Police and fire officials soon arrived, and Frank told the story to an officer. Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40minute train ride downtown--just as he had been seconds after the rescue, which made her think about her reaction at the time. ""I saw the train coming and I was thinking he was going to die, "" she explained. 
 Question:How did Frank save Linda? 
A. By helping her rise to her feet. 
B. By lifting her to the platform. 
C. By pulling her along the ground. 
D. By dragging her away from the edge. 
 Answer: B
Context: It was evening rush hour on Pacific Coast Highway in Redondo Beach, CA. Drivers lined up from traffic signal to traffic signal and were anxious to get home. On a side street merging   into this highway was a timid driver who was afraid to edge in and no one let her in. Some of the drivers backed up behind her and loudly blasted their horns. This made her more upset and nervous. 
On the right of this side street, the signal on Pacific Coast Highway turned red and traffic stopped. A driver who saw what was happening to this woman stopped a few car lengths behind her car and motioned to her to pull in front of his car. She quickly did and as he waited, two more cars dashed in behind her car. 
While the woman he'd helped waited for the signal to turn green, she sank into her driver's seat and was deeply relieved. Although this thoughtful man couldn't see it, her body language expressed her gratitude.
If you've been in a traffic situation like the one she was in, you know how upsetting it can be. But this little act of kindness allowed her to safely reach her home. She told others about this, which encouraged them to do something nice for someone else. 
This kindness spreads. Someone does something nice for you and in turn you're likely to do something nice for that person or for someone else. 
A simple act of kindness could have a widespread effect. It's like a stone that drops in a pond and causes ripples in each direction. No one knows how far those ripples will travel but they will affect everything they touch along the way. 
 Question:What can we know about most of the drivers on Pacific Coast Highway from the story? 
A. They were not friendly or thoughtful. 
B. They are thankful to the driver who helped the lady. 
C. They blasted their horns to encourage the lady driver. 
D. They were not anxious to get home.

Context: Most middle school students find it boring to learn math. But students in Yet Sen Middle School in New York, US, don't think so. Why? Because they are in the school of One Program, which asks students to work on their own or in small groups on computers to have math lessons.
""The program gives the students a new learning style. No traditional classroom can compare with it. We give each lesson according to the students' interest and their strong and weak points, ""said Joel. Klein, the school's headteacher, ""We're looking for a new way that interests students. ""

Context: School education is very important and useful. The students both learn knowledge and get an education. Yet, no one can learn everything from school. The scientists,such as Edison,Newton,Galileo and Einstein, didn't learn everything from school. They learned a lot of knowledge outside school or in practice by themselves. A teacher, even he knows a lot, can't teach his students everything.
The teacher's job is to show his students how to learn, how to read and how to think. A good teacher with rich experience in teaching can teach his students the methods(="" ways)of"" study. Through these methods the students are able to learn and get a lot of things by themselves.
Usually it is very easy for the students to remember some knowledge, but it is very difficult to use it for problems. If a teacher really shows the students the ability of how to use knowledge, it means the teacher has learned lots of knowledge by himself (or herself). The success in learning shows he or she knows how to study. 
 Question:Which of the following is the best title ? 
A. A real job for teachers 
B. Study in and outside school 
C. Practice--the only way of learning 
D. How to learn knowledge

Her father is angry with her when he knows about it.

Context: What could make Michael Jordon, one of the greatest basketball players in history, shed tears?  It was when he became a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame on September 11. The hall is in Springfield, Massachusetts and honors the best basketball players, greatest coaches and other contributors to the game. ""The game of basketball has been everything to me ,"" said Jordan, 46. ""It is the place I have always gone when I needed to find comfort and peace.""
Jordan retired twice in his 15-year career, finishing with 32292 points, the third highest total points in NBA history behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone. His average of 30.12 points a game is the best in the League.
""One day you might look up and see me playing the game at 50,"" Jordan said. ""Because limits, like fears, are often just an illusion.""   In other words, it was motivation that made Jordan such a success..
A great career did not mean a smooth one. His high school coach cut him from the team in favor of a taller player when Jordan was in 10thgrade. His college coach wouldn't allow him on the cover of Sports Illustration in 1981 with North Carolina's four other players because Jordan was a freshman. In his first NBA All-Star game, older NBA stars wouldn't throw him the ball because of jealousy.
""That burned me up,"" Jordan said. ""But _ don't have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it."" 
 Question:When Jordan became a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame,  _ 
A. he found something more encouraging . 
B. he was so excited that he couldn't hold his tears back. 
C. he was happy and sad at the same time. 
D. he felt very comfortable and peaceful. 
 Answer: B
Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""
It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on. 
 Question:That man called after reading about what Jordan did to a disabled child because he wanted to   _  . 
A. become famous himself 
B. know why Jordan appeared in a poor area 
C. let the author know that Jordan was not that nice 
D. offer another example to show that Jordan was a nice man 
 Answer: C
Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""
It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on. 
 Question:What can we learn from this passage? 
A. Jordan is not such a great person. 
B. Jordan deserves the admiration he had from others. 
C. Jordan is always ready to make friends with young people. 
D. Jordan is always misunderstood by expert reviewers.

Context: ""But what if I break my arm again?"" my 5-year-old daughter asked. I knew how much she wanted to learn to ride. Yet ever since she'd fallen off her bike and broken her arm, she'd been afraid.
""Oh honey,"" I said. ""I don't think you'll break another arm.""
""But I could, couldn't I?""
""Yes,"" I admitted, and found myself struggling for the right thing to say. ""I don't think I want to ride,"" she said and got off her bike.
We walked away and sat down beside a tree.
""Don't you want to ride with your friends?"" I asked. ""And I thought you were hoping to start riding your bike to school next year,"" I added.
""I was,"" she said in a low voice.
""You know, honey,"" I said. ""Most everything you do comes with dangers. You could break your arm at gymnastics. Do you want to stop going to the gym?"" ""No, of course not!"" she replied. And with a determined spirit, she stood up and agreed to try again. I held on to the back of her bike until she found the courage to say, ""Let's go!""
I spent the rest of the afternoon at the park watching a very brave little girl overcome a fear, and congratulating myself for being an independent single parent.
As we walked home, pushing the bike as we made our way along the sidewalk, she asked me about a conversation she'd overheard me having with my mother the night before.
""Why were you and Grandma arguing last night?""
""It's nothing."" I told her.
She shrugged  . ""Grandma said she just wanted you to find someone to love.""
""What Grandma wants is for some guy to break my heart again,"" I snapped.
""But Mom ...""
""You're too young to understand."" I told her.
She was quiet for the next few minutes. Then she looked up and in a small voice said, ""So I guess love isn't like a broken arm.""
Unable to answer, we walked the rest of the way in silence. When I got home, I let go and agreed to meet a man called Steve.
Steve was the man for me. We married less than a year later. It turned out my mother and my daughter were right.

Context: On Nov.18,1995,Itzhak Perlman,the violinist,came on stage to give a concert at Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center in New York City.
If you have ever been to a Perlman concert, _ him.He was stricken with polio as a child,and so he has braces on both legs and walks with the aid of two crutches .
He walks painfully, yet majestically, until he reaches his chair.Then he sits down,slowly, puts his crutches on the floor, undoes the clasps on his legs,tucks one foot back and extends the other foot forward.Then he bends down and picks up the violin, puts it under his chin,nods to the conductor and proceeds to play.
But this time,something went wrong.Just as he fmished the first few bars ,one of the strings on his violin broke.You could hear it snap ---it went off like gunfire across the room.There was no mistaking what that meant.There was no mistaking what he had to do.
We figured that he would have to get up,put on the clasps again,pick up the crutches and limp his way off stage-to either find another violin or else find another string for this one.But he didn't.Instead.he waited a moment,closed his eyes and then signaled the conductor to begin again.
The orchestra began,and he played from where he had left off.And he played with such passion and such power and such purity as they had never heard before.
When he finished, there was an awesome silence in the room.And then people rose and cheered.He smiled,wiped the sweat from this brow, raised his bow to quit us,and then he said in a quiet tone.""You know, sometimes it is the artist's task to find out how much music you can still make with what you have left.'' 
 Question:Itzhak Perlman can be best described as a man who is  _  . 
A. clever 
B. strong willed 
C. humourous 
D. quite skilled

Context: Benjamin Franklin is remembered as an inventor, author, statesman, and signer of the Declaration of Independence. But all great people were kids once and got into naughty. In writing about his life, Franklin recalled a youthful event that he later regretted.
Franklin was born in Boston in 1706. His father, whom Ben admired and respected, was a soapmaker and candlemaker with a large family. At the age of ten, Ben was taken out of school and put to work in the shop.
Ben described his duties as ""cutting wick  for the candles, filling the dipping mold .But of course he preferred playing outdoors with his friends.
One such plot is told here in his own words.
""There was a saltwetland that bounded part of the millpond, on the edge of which, at high water, we used to stand to fish for minnows . By much abuse, we had made it a only quagmire . My proposal was to build a wharf  there fit for us to stand upon, and I showed my comrades a large pile of stones, which were intended for a new house near the wetland, and which would very well suit our purpose. Accordingly, in the evening, when the workmen were gone, I gathered a number of my playfellows, and working with them diligently like so many ants, sometimes two or three to a stone, we brought them all away and built our little wharf. The next morning the workmen were surprised at missing the stones, which were found in our wharf. Inquiry was made after the removers;we were discovered and complained of;several of us were corrected by our fathers;and, though I pleaded the usefulness of the work, mine convinced me that nothing was useful which was not honest.""

Context: Carly Zalenski's eyes filled with tears as the dusty bus ran down a dirt road in southern Vietnam. The 14-year-old and her family had traveled by plane from Canton, Ohio. Now, as they approached the village, hundreds of cheering schoolchildren lined the entrance to the Hoa Lac School, a two-story concrete building that Carly had raised money for.
    Carly started helping others at eight, handing out Thanksgiving baskets at church to families in need. It was a snowy day, and she saw many girls didn't have warm coats. The next November, she went door to door asking for used coats, hats, gloves and scarves, and then handed them out with the baskets.
   But Carly wanted to do more. She remembered her grandmother's Rotarv Club ("""") had, years earlier, raised money to build a school in Vietnam. That was what she now wanted to do.
   At 12, she began to raise money for Vietnamese children with a PowerPoint presentation. ""The kids in rural Vietnam don't have decent schools. I want to give them a place to make their lives better,"" she told a room of 200 Rotarians.
  That summer, Carly set off with her family across Ohio, visiting three or four Rotarv Clubs a week. ""We traveled like crazy people to all these meetings,"" recalls her mother, Kris.
   At first they got no donations. But one night, Carly and her dad, Fred, pulled up to a building in Minerva, Ohio. Carrying a laptop, a projector and a screen, they walked into a bar where 15 people were sitting around a long table. There was dead silence after Carly finished her presentation. Fred thought that was never going to work. Then someone made a motion: ""Let's give this girl check right now."" Minutes later, Carly walked out with her first donation: $500.
   Not everyone was  _ about the idea of helping Vietnam. ""Why should we help it?"" asked one veteran  . Carly replied simply, ""They're kids. And I'm just a kid who wants to help out.""
   As word spread, individual donors sent checks for as little as $5. A restaurant chain contributed $1,000. Carly's coach organized a tournament that netted $4,000. A bible camp bought 500 backpacks for the children. In two years, Carly raised $50,000. 
 Question:Why did Carly once collect used clothes from door to door? 
A. To donate them to a charity. 
B. To help Vietnamese children. 
C. To raise money for a Rotary Club. 
D. To give them to people in need.

Context: One day,Mr.Arnold was teaching a lesson,and things were going as normally as ever.He was explaining the story of mankind to his pupils.He told them that,in the beginning,men were nomads ;they never stayed in the same place for very long.Instead,they would travel about,here and there,in search of food,wherever it was to be found. And when the food ran out,they would move off somewhere else.
He taught them about the invention of farming and keeping animals.This was an important discovery,because by learning to cultivate the land,and care for animals,mankind would always have food steadily available.It also meant that people could remain living in one place,and this made it easier to set about tasks that would take a long while to complete,like building towns,cities,and all that were in them.All the children listening were attracted by this story,until Lucy jumped up:
""And if that was so important and improved everything so much,why are we nomads all over again,Mr.Arnold?""
Mr.Arnold didn't know what to say. Lucy was a very intelligent girl.He knew that she lived with her parents in a house,so she must know that her family were not nomads;so what did she mean?
""We have all become nomads again,"" continued Lucy.""The other day,outside the city,they were cutting the forest down. A while ago a fisherman told me how they fish.It's the same with everyone:when there's no more forest left, the foresters go elsewhere,and when the fish run out, the fishermen move on.That's what the nomads did,isn't it?""
The teacher nodded,thoughtfully. Really,Lucy was right. Mankind had turned into nomads. Instead of looking after the land in a way that we could be sure it would keep supplying our needs,we kept developing it until the land was bare.And then off we would go to the next place!            The class spent the rest of the afternoon talking about what they could do to show how to be more civilized.
The next day everyone attended class wearing a green Tshirt,with a message that said,""I am not a nomad!""
And,from then on,they set about showing that indeed they were not.Every time they knew they needed something,they made sure that they would get it using care and control.If they needed wood or paper,they would make sure that they got the recycled kind.They ordered their fish from fish farms,making sure that the fish they received were not too young and too small.They only used animals that were well cared for,and brought up on farms.
And so,from their little town,those children managed to give up being nomads again,just as prehistoric men had done so many thousands of years ago. 
 Question:The writer tries to make us believe that  _  . 
A. mankind has been progressing mainly through traveling about 
B. it's unwise for mankind to use the land in an uncontrolled way 
C. it's quite good for students to learn more about the history of mankind 
D. teachers should encourage students to voice their own opinions

Context: Mothers and daughters go through so much--yet when was the last time a mother and daughter sat down to write a book together about it all? Perri Klass and her mother, Sheila Solomon Klass, both gifted professional writers, prove to be ideal co-writers as they examine their decades of motherhood, daughterhood, and the wonderful ways their lives have overlapped  .
Perri notes with amazement how closely her own life has mirrored her mother's: both have full-time careers; both have published books, articles, and stories; each has three children; they both love to read. They also love to travel--in fact, they often take trips together. But in truth, the harder they look at their lives, the more they acknowledge their big differences in circumstance and basic nature.

Starting with her college education, she has fought for everything she's ever accomplished. Perri, on the other hand, grew up privileged in the New Jersey suburbs of the 1960s and 1970s. For Sheila, wasting time or money is a crime, and luxury is unthinkable while Perri enjoys the occasional small luxury, but has not been successful at trying to persuade her mother into enjoying even the tiniest thing she likes.
Each writing in her own unmistakable voice, Perri and Sheila take turns exploring the joys and pains, the love and bitterness, the minor troubles and lasting respect that have always bonded them together. Sheila describes the adventure of giving birth to Perri in a tiny town in Trinidad where her husband was doing research fieldwork. Perri admits that she can't sort out all the mess in the households, even though she knows it drives her mother crazy. Together they compare thoughts on bringing up children and working, admit long-hidden sorrows, and enjoy precious memories.
Looking deep into the lives they have lived separately and together, Perri and Sheila tell their mother-daughter story with honesty, humor, enthusiasm, and admiration for each other. A written account in two voices, Every Mother Is a Daughter is a duet   that produces a deep, strong sound with the experiences that all mothers and daughters will recognize. 
 Question:How are women's lives explored in this book? 
A. In a musical form. 
B. Through field research. 
C. With unique writing skills. 
D. From different points of view. 
 Answer: D
Context: For every woman who feels like she's had to scale back her personal ambitions since becoming a mother, gold medal cyclist Kristin Armstrong has a message: Don't give up on your dreams.
She retired after winning gold in Beijing to start a family; son Lucas arrived in 2010, but then she decided to compete again in the London Olympics. She won a gold medal at last.
The decision to start training again wasn't easy. ""I struggled with that a lot,"" she told a newspaper. ""At the beginning I felt selfish, I felt like, 'Well, I'm not supposed to be thinking of myself anymore. It's all supposed to be for my kid.'""
She faced physical challenges of getting back into competition shape after giving birth, as well. When she started racing in the spring of 2011, she was still breast-feeding; she would nurse her son, then race, then breast-feed again after the race. Her days revolved around Lucas and training.
""I feel like I'm able to do what I love to do and still manage a family and have that balance,"" Armstrong said. ""That you have a family or a child doesn't mean that you have to stop going after what you dream of individually.""
Armstrong makes balance look easy, whether it's on her bike or as an athlete-mom. But she points out that you can't have it all without making some sacrifices. For example, don't expect a neat home--her husband, Joe Savola, who she describes as her support system and her ""protector"", says he's had to give up on trying to keep everything orderly at home and just accept that their living room has become Lucas's playroom. For Armstrong, she's sacrificed time with friends who had kids around the same age--there just wasn't time.
Now, she says, ""That sounds like fun to me."" As she heads home to Boise, Idaho, she's ready to do regular mom stuff. 
 Question:In most days of 2011, Armstrong could be described as   _  . 
A. a housewife and a new mom 
B. an athlete and a career woman 
C. a parent and a sportswoman 
D. a wife and a good mother 
 Answer: C
Context: Dear Maya Shao-ming,
To me, June 6, 1990 is a special day. My long-awaited dream came true the minute your father cried, ""A girl!"" You are more than just a second child, more than just a girl to match our boy. You, little daughter, are the link to our female line, the legacy of another woman's pain and sacrifice 31 years ago.
Let me tell you about your Chinese grandmother. Somewhere in Hong Kong, in the late fifties, a young waitress found herself pregnant   by a cook, probably a co-worker at her restaurant. She carried the baby to term, suffered to give it birth, and kept the little girl for the first three months of her life. I like to think that my mother--your grandmother--loved me and fought to raise me on her own, but that the daily struggle was too hard. Worn down by the demands of the new baby and perhaps the constant threat of starvation, she made the painful decision to give away her girl so that both of us might have a chance for a better life.
More likely, I was dropped at the orphanage (M JLR) steps or somewhere else. I will probably never know the truth. Having a baby in her unmarried state would have brought shame on the family in China, so she probably kept my existence a secret. Once I was out of her life, it was as if I had never been born. And so you and your brother and I are the missing leaves on a family tree.
Do they ever wonder if we exist?
Before I was two, I was adopted by an Anglo couple. Fed three square meals a day, I grew like a wild weed and grasped all the opportunities they had to offer--books, music, education, church life and community activities. In a family of blue-eyed blonds, though, _ . Whether from jealousy or fear of someone who looked so different, my older brothers sometimes teased me about my unpleasing skin, or made fun of my clumsy walk. Moody and impatient, burdened by fears that none of us realized resulted from my early years of need, I was not an easy child to love. My mother and I conflicted countless times over the years, but gradually came to see one another as real human beings with faults and talents, and as women of strength in our own right. Lacking a mirror image in the mother who raised me, I had to seek my identity as a woman on my own. The Asian American community has helped me regain my double identity.
But part of me will always be missing: my beginnings, my personal history, all the delicate details that give a person her origin. Nevertheless, someone gave me a lucky name ""Siu Wai."" ""Siu"" means ""little,"" and ""Wai means ""clever."" Therefore, my baby name was ""Clever little one."" Who chose those words? Who cared enough to note my arrival in the world?
I lost my Chinese name for 18 years. It was Americanized for convenience to ""Sue."" But like an ill-fitting coat, it made me uncomfortable. I hated the name. But even more, I hated being Chinese. It took many years to become proud of my Asian origin and work up the courage to take back my birth-name. That, plus a little knowledge of classroom Cantonese, is all the Chinese culture I have to offer you. Not white, certainly, but not really Asian, I try to pave  the way between the two worlds and bridge the gap for you. Your name, ""Shao-ming,"" is very much like mine--""Shao"" means ""little."" And ""ming"" is ""bright,"" as in a shining sun or moon. Whose lives will you brighten, little Maya? Your past is more complete than mine, and each day I cradle you in your babyhood, generously giving you the loving care I lacked for my first two years. When I pat you, I comfort the lost baby inside me who still cries for her mother.
Sweet Maya, it doesn't matter what you ""become"" later on. You have already fulfilled my wildest dreams.
I love you,
Mommy 
 Question:What can be inferred from Mommy's Anglo family life? 
A. She used to experience an identity crisis. 
B. She fought against her American identity. 
C. She forgot the pains of her early years. 
D. She kept her love for Asia from childhood. 
 Answer: A

Instantly the baby girl seemed to _ . Her pulse rate   began to calm down.
""Keep on singing, Michael,"" encouraged Karen with tears in her eyes. ""You never know, dear, how much I love you, please don't take my sunshine away."" As Michael sang to his sister, the baby's breath became smooth.

Context: I can still remember my first day at school. I was only 6 years old at that time. It was a very big room. I sat at the desk near the window, but I couldn't see anything because the windows were too high. There was a big map of the world on the wall. But I don't think I was worried or unhappy at that time. There was another little boy next to me. He sat there and kept quiet at first. Then he began to cry, because he didn't want to stay there.
More and more students came in , but the boy didn't stop crying "" Mom, I want to go home. "" He cried again and again. Later , the teacher came in . She went to the little boy, and said something to him. I couldn't hear what she said. Soon the boy stopped crying and began to smile.
To this day, I still don't know what the teacher said to the little boy. 
 Question:Why he couldn't see anything ? 
A. Because he was short. 
B. Because the window was too high. 
C. Because he was short seeing.

 Answer: B
Context: The other day an acquaintance of mine, an outgoing and charming man, told me he had found himself unexpectedly alone in New York for an hour or two between appointments. He went to the Whitney and spent the ""empty"" time looking at things in solitary  happiness. For him it proved to be a shock nearly as great as falling in love to discover that he could enjoy himself so much alone.
What had he been afraid of, I asked myself? That, suddenly alone, he would discover that he bored himself, or that there was, quite simply, no self there to meet? But having taken a decisive step, he is now on the edge of adventure; he is about to be launched into his own inner space to the astronaut. 
His every perception  will come to him with a new freshness and, for a time, seem surprisingly original. For anyone who can see things for himself with a naked eye becomes, for a moment or two, something of a genius. 
With another human being present, vision becomes double vision, unavoidably. We are busy wondering, what does my companion see or think of this, and what do I think of it? The original impact gets lost.
""Music I heard with you was more than music."" Exactly. And therefore music itself can only be heard alone. Solitude  is the salt of personhood. It brings out the authentic flavor of every experience.
""Alone one is never lonely: the spirit adventures, walking in a quiet garden, in a cool house, staying single there.""
Loneliness is very strongly felt with other people, for with others, even with a lover sometimes, we suffer from our differences of taste, temperament and mood. Human intercourse  often demands that we soften the edge of perception, or withdraw at the very instant of personal truth for fear of hurting, or of being inappropriately present, which is to say naked, in a social situation. Alone we can afford to be wholly whatever we are, and to feel whatever we feel  ly. That is a great luxury!
For me the most interesting thing about a solitary life, and mine has been that for the last twenty years, is that it becomes increasingly rewarding. When I can wake up and watch the sun rise over the ocean, as I do most days, and know that I have an entire day ahead, uninterrupted, in which to write a few pages, take a walk with my dog, lie down in the afternoon for a long think (why does one think better in a horizontal position?), read and listen to music, I am flooded with happiness.
I'm lonely only when I am overtired, when I have worked too long without a break, when from the time being I feel empty and need filling up. And I am lonely sometimes when I come back home after a lecture trip, when I have seen a lot of people and talked a lot, and am full to the brim  with experience that needs to be sorted out. 
Then for a little while the house feels huge and empty, and I wonder where my self is hiding. It has to be recaptured  slowly by watering the plants and perhaps, by looking again at each one as though it were a person. 
It takes a while, as I watch the surf blowing up in fountains at the end of the field, but the moment comes when the world falls away, and the self emerges again from the deep unconscious, bringing back all I have recently experienced to be explored and slowly understood, when I can converse  again with my hidden powers, and so grow, and so be renewed, till death do us part. 
 Question:Which of the following is the writer's opinion about being alone? 
A. Being alone is actually an adventure of exploring one's outer space. 
B. People are lonely because they lack communication between each other. 
C. One can enjoy the authentic flavor of every experience when he is alone. 
D. People need to be alone because only then do they have double vision. 
 Answer: C
Context: The murmur of the audience had just faded into expectant silence. This was one of the most important days in little five-year-old Patricia McKee's life: the Kernot School Concert. She stood behind the curtain with her schoolmates. Yet she was not afraid because everyone had been practicing for weeks and knew their parts by heart.
Being in a remote country town, Patricia knew that everyone would turn out for the big occasion-everyone! Yet, it was this awareness that added a sense of sadness to her excitement. There were two people who couldn't be in that audience that night-her mum and dad.
Patricia's mother and father ran the local general store, which was open for business 24 hours. So it was simply accepted that Mum and Dad could never attend community activities. It had been this way with her sister, so why should it be any different for her?
Still, Patricia couldn't help wishing that her mum and dad could be there to see her on such a special day, so she decided to bring up the subject with her mother. Sadly, she had to face the facts. At such a young age, Patricia couldn't really understand the deep pain in her mother's response: ""I'll try to be there, sweetheart, but you know how hard it is for us to get away from the store.""
Yet as the curtain slowly opened on the stage of the Kernot Hall, little Patricia McKee got the surprise of her life. There, sitting four rows the front was her mother with a big smile on her face!
This powerful image remains one of Patricia's most treasured memories. ""Words cannot express the pure joy we both experienced at that moment. I was really _ ,"" said Patricia, now a parent herself. Her parents have passed away, but what a wonderful legacy they've left us: when someone really needs you, be there for them. 
 Question:Why did Patricia have a feeling of sadness? 
A. She had no chance to watch the concert. 
B. She performed unsuccessfully at the concert. 
C. Her parents had gone to a remote country town. 
D. Her parents were unlikely to attend the concert.

Context: It was shortly before midnight, and Dr Patricia was getting ready for bed. The phone rang on the end of the line was a woman about to break a promise.
The woman was her mother's neighbour. Flora Harris had made the neighbour swear she wouldn't tell her daughter she'd a heart attack and was in the hospital, for fear her daughter would worry. The neighbour wisely decided to disobey orders.

In some ways, Harris is lucky. She has the resources to make the trips to Los Angeles. Plus, Harris is a doctor who treats the elderly.
"" But it's still tough,"" she said. "" I can foresee what the next few years are going to look like, and it's not a pretty picture. My father's going to need diapers  . There will come a time when he won' t recognize me and he's easily excited. I worry he's going to be violent and hurt my mother.""

Context: Two people sit down to play Go . One of the players is an old man. He is now 89 years old. He has spent all of his life playing this game. The other person is a young woman. She has been playing Go for only three years. Before this, the woman was an expert at playing computer games. Now she plays Go the same way she played computer games---by becoming a machine herself.
They will play many games, until they know who the winner is. The woman shows no feelings but thinking about all the possible ways of placing her next stone. The old man, on the other hand, looks at the movements of her hands and of her face. This has always helped him to win.
He wins the first three games. She wins the next game, and the man is surprised. He has never lost to a woman. The old man worries about the way the young woman is playing the game. He can't read her face, he does not understand her way of playing.
""The way I think about the game"", says the woman, ""is that it is steps for getting what I want."" Again, the old man is surprised. For him, the game is a way of life itself, and not a model of life. ""There is no more beauty any longer. Everything is science and rules. Everything is about winning. Nothing is about playing,"" he says.
They cannot agree with each other, but it is not necessary. ""Change is a necessary part of life"", thinks the man. ""Playing is as important as winning"", thinks the woman.
They start to play their final game. 
 Question:. Before the woman plays Go, she  was

B. a computer science teacher 
C. a computer engineer

On Saturday morning we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron had come along with two friends,Kevin and Simon,while sisters Carole and Lynn had come with Amanda. There were some other members I didn't know. We had come from different places and none of us knew the area.
We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors,but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing and then we changed at lunchtime.

Context: How do you pay for things? Do you usually use cash , or do you like to pay by credit card ? If you are like a lot of people, you probably have at least one credit card. Also, you might use it more often than you probably should.
Credit cards first became popular in the 1920s, At that time, businesses, such as hotels and companies, gave credit cards to their best customers . Unlike today's credit cards, customers could only use these cards at the Store or business that gave out the card. Customers had to pay for things in full. They couldn't pay for something a little at a time.
In 1950, a businessman named McNamara started a credit card company -- Diners Club. Unlike earlier credit cards, this card could be used by customers at many restaurants. Customers liked the card because they didn't have to carry a lot of cash with them. Restaurant owners liked the card, too. Why? They found out that customers usually spent more money when they could pay by credit card.
In its first year of business, Diners Club _ 200 cards, The customers who got the cards from the Diners Club could use them at 27 different restaurants. Today, Diners Club has about 8 million customers, and they can use their cards in over 7. 6 million businesses in more than 200 countries. 
 Question:What can we know about the earlier credit cards from the passage? 
A. They could be used everywhere. 
B. Customers had to pay for things in full. 
C. They were very popular before the 1920s. 
D. Everyone could get this kind of credit card.

Context: Several years ago ,Masaru Ibuka ,chairman of Sony ,was at a company planning a meeting. Suddenly he hdd a brilliant idea. He stopped the meeting and asked everyone present what would happen if Sony removed the recording function and 'speaker and sold headphones with a tape player instead. Almost everyone thought he was crazy. Still ,Ibuka kept thinking about his idea and worked at improving it The result, of course, turned out to be the wildly successful Sony Walkman.
Good ideas often start with a seemingly silly question. Bill Bowerman was making breakfast one day. As he stood there making waffles  for his son, he wondered what would happen if he poured rubber into his waffle iron. Later ,he tried it and the result looked something Like the bottom of most sports shoes we see today. Still, when he took this idea to several existing shoe companies, he was laughed at In fact, every single company turned him down. Though rather discouraged, Bowerman insisted and went on to form his own company, making NBKE athletic shoes.
Sometime good ideas grow out of frustration  .When Fred Smith was a student at Yale University, he had some paperwork that he needed to have delivered across the country the next day. Smith was amazed to find out that overnight delivery was impossible. He sat for a long while ,lost in thought Why couldn't there be a reliable overnight mail delivery service? He decided to design one. Smith did just that and turned his design into a class project His business professor gave him only a C for his efforts. However, Smith was not through. He improved the idea in that class project and finally turned them into one of the first and most successful overnight mail service in the world -- FedEx.
We know that each of these ideas led to a very successful product or service that has changed the way many of us live. The best questions are usually open-ended and are often silly, Children aren't afraid to ask such questions ,but adults frequently are. Think how different the world might be if people never asked "" silly"" questions!

Context: I never thought I would have a life-changing experience at Wal-Mart.
Although my thoughts were only on speed, the checkout line I was standing in wasn't moving as quickly as I wanted, and I glanced toward the cashier.
There stood a man in his seventies, wearing glasses and a nice smile. I thought, well, he's an old guy!
For the next few minutes I watched him. He greeted every customer before scanning the items. Sure, his words were the usual, ""How's it going?"" But he did something different--he actually listened to people. Then he would respond to what they had said and engage them in brief conversation.
I thought it was odd. I has grown accustomed to people asking me how I was doing simply out of robotic conversational habit. After a while, you don't give any thought to the question and just mumble something back. I could say, ""I just found out I have six months to live,"" and someone would reply, ""Have a great day!""
But that wasn't the end.
He gave them the change, walked around the counter, and extended his right hand in an act of friendship. He looked the customers in the eyes. ""I sure want to thank you for shopping here today,"" he told them. ""You have a great day. Bye-bye.""
The looks on the faces of the customers were priceless. There were smiles and some sheepish grins. All had been touched by his simple gesture--and in a place they never expected. They would gather their things and walk out, smiling.
Of course, he did the same to me and I got to know his name--Marty.
Who was that guy? It was as if Sam Walton had come back from the dead and invaded this old guy's body.
I had never walked away from that shop feeling like that. 
 Question:What can we infer about Sam Walton? 
A. He might be Marty's father or grandfather. 
B. He might have died while working in the market. 
C. He might be friendly and devoted to Wal-Mart. 
D. He might have come back from the dead once before.

Context: (2013*,B)On a sunny day last August,Tim heard some shouting.Looking out to the sea carefully,he saw a couple of kids in a rowboat were being pulled out to sea.
Two 12yearold boys,Christian and Jack,rowed out a boat to search for a football.Once they'd rowed beyond the calm waters,a beach umbrella tied to the boat caught the wind and pulled the boat into open water.The pair panicked and tried to row back to shore.But they were no match for _ and the boat was out of control.
Tim knew it would soon be swallowed by the waves.

Tim took off his clothes and jumped into the water.Every 500 yards or so,he raised his head to judge his progress.""At one point,I considered turning back,"" he says.""I wondered if I was putting my life at risk.""After 30 minutes of struggling,he was close enough to yell to the boys,""Take down the umbrella!""
Christian made much effort to take down the umbrella.Then Tim was able to catch up and climb aboard the boat.He took over rowing,but the waves were almost too strong for him.
""Let's aim for the pier ,""Jack said.Tim turned the boat toward it.Soon afterward,waves crashed over the boat,and it began to sink.""Can you guys swim?""he cried.""A little bit,""the boys said.
Once they were in the water,Tim decided it would be safer and faster for him to pull the boys toward the pier.Christian and Jack were wearing life jackets and floated on their backs.Tim swam toward land as water washed over the boys'faces.
""Are we almost there?""they asked again and again.""Yes,""Tim told them each time.
After 30 minutes,they reached the pier.

Context: On an August afternoon last year, Pamela Rivers, 40, and her friend Rita Graham, 38, were stopped at a red light on Cobb's Creek Parkway in South Philadelphia when a white SUV traveling in the opposite direction turned across traffic in front of them. It then jumped the curb   and rushed through a grassy expanse   before plunging down an embankment   toward Cobb's Creek. Pamela quickly pulled over, jumped out of her car, and dialed 911.
Kenny Gibson, 23, and his friend Taron Green, 25, were driving home from a job when Rita flagged them down. Kenny stopped, and the men got out of the car and looked over the cliff. The SUV had landed upside down in five feet of water. A woman's leg could be seen swinging out the driver's side window.
""I have a fear of water,"" Kenny said now. ""I almost drowned when I was nine."" Even so, he and Taron hurried down the 50-foot embankment into the muddy water. ""I couldn't just leave her,"" he adds.
The men waded out to the car and saw that the woman, Cheryl Allison, 61, was partially in water. Kenny tried unsuccessfully to open the door. Then he broke the window. But when he reached in to pull out Cheryl, he found she was trapped by the seat belt.
""Run back to the truck and grab a box cutter ,"" Kenny yelled to Taron. Meanwhile, Kenny tried in vain to push the car onto its side to create an air pocket for Cheryl.
That's when mechanic Marcell Porter approached the site. ""I flipped into rescue mode,"" he said. When Taron returned, Kenny cut through the seat belt with the box cutter. He and Marcell tried to pull Cheryl out, but she wouldn't come out.
Marcell broke the rear window with a rock, hoping to rescue her from the back. Then he saw that she was still strapped in by her shoulder belt. Marcell reached for the box cutter and cut the remaining strap in two. Kenny leaned in, grabbed Cheryl by the waist, and pulled her out feet first. Marcell grasped Cheryl's legs, and they managed to drag her lifeless body onto a rock.
""Give her CPR!"" Pamela yelled down to them. But the two men had no idea what to do. ""Put your mouth on her mouth and breathe,"" she shouted to Marcell. And to Kenny, ""Pump her chest!""
""We tried three times,"" said Marcell. Finally, Cheryl brought up water and started moving her fingers. The men rolled her over onto her stomach to let out more water.
Soon an ambulance arrived and transported Cheryl to the hospital, where doctors treated her. They never discovered what caused her to pass out, but she assumes it had something to do with the burning summer heat.
Over the next few days, they took turns visiting Cheryl in the hospital, where they shared hugs and tears. ""We couldn't believe she was all right,"" said Pamela.
""It's just amazing that these people came together,"" said Cheryl. She stays in touch with her ""angels"" via frequent phone calls. ""They are really beautiful people,"" she said.

Context: Hunters and bears are often put in fairy tales and often provide a lot for us to think about life and human nature.
Two hunters, Ali and Hagan, went hunting for bears. For four days they saw nothing. Each night they slept in a nearby village, pledging  to make part of the bear's skin against the cost of their lodging  . On the fifth day a huge bear appeared, and Ali said nervously to his friend, ""I don't mind admitting that I'm afraid to take this bear."" Hagan laughed, ""Just leave it to me, little coward.""
So Ali  _ like lightning up the nearest tree at once, and Hagan stood with his gun at the ready. The huge creature came, moving on in a slow and awkward way, and Hagan began to grow more and more scared. At last he raised his gun to his shoulder, but by now he was trembling so much that, before he could take proper aim, his gun went off and missed the target .
Hagan, remembering that bears never touch a dead body, threw himself flat on the ground and held his breath. The bear came up, sniffed all around him and moved off in the end.
Ali, who had been watching the whole thing from the tree, now came down and, congratulating Hagan on his escape, asked him, ""What did the bear whisper in your ear just now?""
""Don't sell the bear's skin before you have caught the bear,"" Hagan announced.

Context: You can do it!
That's a better way to motivate   yourself than saying ""I can do it, "" according to a new study that shows giving yourself advice and encouragement in the second-person before an upcoming task may actually improve your performance more than first-person self-talk.
""People are used to receiving and giving advice in the second-person, and they seem to prefer using the second-person pronoun to encourage themselves,"" says study co-author, Dr. Sanda Dolcos, a researcher at the University of Illinois. ""Self-advice expressed using 'You' probably enables people to have a broader perspective , consider how others might view the event, and reproduce the kind of encouragements previously received from others.""
For the study, Dr. Dolcos and her colleague, Dr. Dolores, asked 143 undergraduate students to write down advice to themselves before completing a series of puzzles. Half of the students were asked to use the first-person, while the others wrote in the second-person.
What did the researchers find? The students who wrote in the second-person managed to complete more puzzles and appeared to have a more positive attitude.
The researchers also asked the students to write down advice to themselves in relation to exercising more often in the next two weeks. Those who wrote in the second-person, again, reported a more positive attitude toward the task and even planned to do more exercise than the students who referred to themselves in the first-person.
""We were not surprised and had previous research showing that people _ use 'You' in situations that require high levels of self-control and action,"" Dolcos said.
But why did the researchers ask students to write down their self-talk instead of saying it out loud? "" Writing as a tool of conversing with oneself has long been used as a therapeutical approach,"" Dolcos explained. ""However, further research is needed to determine which form of self-advice, written or spoken, is more beneficial."" 
 Question:What did the researchers find? 
A. Giving oneself advice and encouragement is very useful. 
B. It is more encouraging to talk to oneself using the second-person. 
C. First-person self-talk will not improve your performance. 
D. A good way to motivate yourself is saying ""I can do it"". 
 Answer: B
Context: Canadian experts have found that so - called self - help books may actually do more harm than good to people who really need help.Researchers say that individuals   with low respect felt much worse after repeating positive statements about themselves.
In their study, psychologists Joanne Wood and John Lee sought to determine how positive thinking affected people with different levels of self - confidence.They questioned dozens of people both made and female, analyzed their self - worth and optimism by means of the standard psychological methods and then asked them to write down their thoughts and feelings.The scoring system ranged from 0 to 35.
During the experiment, the researchers asked a total of 68 participants to repeat the self-help book phrase, ""I am a lovable person."" After that they measured the participants' moods and their feelings about themselves.The results revealed that the participants in the low self - respect group who repeated the mantra  , were feeling much worse afterwards, when compared to other participants in low self - respect group who did not repeat the phrase.Those with low self - respect who repeated the phrase scored an average of 10 points.Their counterparts   with equally low self - respect who were not asked to repeat the statement, were able to score a little higher average of 17 points.
However, individuals with high self - respect reported feeling better after repeating the positive self - statement - but only slightly.They scored an average of 31 points, compared with an average of 25 for those with equally high self - respect who did not repeat the phrase.
Professor Wood urged those who promote self - help books, magazines and television shows to stop telling people that simply repeating a positive mantra could change one's life.First, people start following this idea and feel like they are not alone.They are told that all they have to do is just to read that book and then to repeat these positive statements in a hope that things will be better, and when it does not work for them and they realize that nothing gets better, then it is really frustration to people.
Researchers concluded: ""Repeating positive self - statements may benefit certain people such as individuals with high self - respect but discourage the very people who need confidence the most."" 
 Question:So - called self - help books do some good to  _  . 
A. people lacking confidence 
B. people with high self - respect 
C. people with problems to settle urgently 
D. people repeating positive self - statements

Context: The day my husband fell to his death,it started to snow,just like any November day.His body,when I found it,was lightly covered with snow.It snowed almost every day for the next four months,while I sat on the couch and watched it pile up.One morning,I _ downstairs and was surprised to see a snow remover clearing my driveway and the bent back of a woman shoveling my walk.I dropped to my knees,crawled through the living room.And back up stairs so those good people would not see me.I was embarrassed.My first thought was,how would I ever repay them? I didn't have the strength to brush my hair let alone shovel someone's walk.
Before John's death,I took pride in the fact that I rarely asked for help or favors,I defined myself by my competence and independence.So who was I if I was no longer capable and busy? How could I respect myself if all I did was sit on the couch every day and watch the snowfall?

B. The writer had been busy with her life before. 
C. The writer recovered from her sorrow quickly with his friend's help. 
D. The day her husband died,it was snowing heavily. 
 Answer: B
Context: The day my husband fell to his death,it started to snow,just like any November day.His body,when I found it,was lightly covered with snow.It snowed almost every day for the next four months,while I sat on the couch and watched it pile up.One morning,I _ downstairs and was surprised to see a snow remover clearing my driveway and the bent back of a woman shoveling my walk.I dropped to my knees,crawled through the living room.And back up stairs so those good people would not see me.I was embarrassed.My first thought was,how would I ever repay them? I didn't have the strength to brush my hair let alone shovel someone's walk.
Before John's death,I took pride in the fact that I rarely asked for help or favors,I defined myself by my competence and independence.So who was I if I was no longer capable and busy? How could I respect myself if all I did was sit on the couch every day and watch the snowfall?
Learning how to receive the love and support that came my way wasn't easy.Friends cooked forme and l cried because I couldn't even help them set the table.""I'm not usually this lazy,""I wept.Finally,my friend Kathy sat down with me and said,""Mary,cooking for you is not a burden.

Context: Two good friends, Sam and Jason, met with a car accident on their way home one snowy night. The next morning, Sam woke up blind. His legs were broken. The doctor, Mr Lee, was standing by his bed, looking at him worriedly. When he saw Sam awake, he asked, ""How are you feeling, Sam?"" Sam smiled and said, ""Not bad, Doctor. Thank you very much for doing the special operation ."" Mr Lee was moved by Sam. When he was leaving, Sam said, ""Please don't tell Jason about it."" ""Well...Well...OK,"" Mr Lee replied.
Months later when Jason's wounds healed , Sam was still very sick. He couldn't see or walk. He could do nothing but stay in his wheelchair all day long. At first, Jason stayed with him for a few days. But days later, Jason thought it boring to spend time with a disabled man like Sam. So he went to see Sam less and less. He made new friends.

So I gave my eyes to you so that you can enjoy life as a healthy man. Now you have new friends. I'm glad to see that you are as healthy and happy as usual. I'm glad you live a happy life.

Context: Lee's mother Sun became unexpectedly pregnant while married to a disabled man. Doctors told her that because of a medication she had been taking her child would not be normal. She chose to continue with the pregnancy and in 1985 in Seoul, South Korea, little Hee Ah Lee was born with only two fingers on each hand, disfigurement of her legs, and slight brain injury. The hospital told Sun that she could not care for the child at home and her relatives wanted her to place the child for adoption in a foreign country. Sun, however, thought her baby would live a successful life.
When Lee was a pre-schooler, Sun wanted her daughter to take piano lessons for two reasons. One was that she felt it would help her strengthen her hands so she could hold a pencil. The other was that she felt that if she could master the piano, she could master anything. For six months piano schools turned them down and then the one teacher who did accept the task got discouraged and wanted to quit. It was a three-month contest of wills between mother and daughter that led to a conflict in which Sun actually threw her daughter on the floor in frustration. But Lee got back up on the piano bench and for the first time played a children's song. That was the turning point and one year later Lee won the grand prize in a piano concert for Kindergartners. It was at the age of 7 that Lee won Korea's 19th National Handicap Conquest Contest and was presented with her award by the President of Korea.
Lee has won numerous awards, and is a widely traveled concert pianist with more than 200 appearances. Her first album titled ""Hee-ah, a Pianist with Four Fingers"" was released in June, 2008.
Lee speaks highly of her mother for challenging her to master the piano and said that although her training was difficult, ""As time went by, the piano became my source of inspiration and my best friend."" 
 Question:When was Lee awarded by the president of Korea? 
A. 1985 
B. 1992 
C. 2008 
D. 2007

Context: Miss Popular
I was awkward in middle school: bony and athletic, with a high grade in science and a low one in self-esteem. Though I had a few friends, I wasn't popular. I was picked last in football and I sometimes ate lunch by myself.
I remember the day Brittany came to our school. Her teeth were crooked , and she was a little overweight. Not that this mattered though, because she walked around like she was better than all of us. She was outspoken and incredibly frightening, making people lose confidence.
Around Brittany, I tried my best to go unnoticed. Standing out or stealing her spotlight could only result in one thing: conflict. Brittany was always the first girl picked for teams; I was lucky if I was picked at all. I was thrown the ball while she stood with the quarterback, chatting about the last party she'd gone to. I had never been to a party before or kissed a boy.
One day, a classmate asked me to the school dance. I was flattered. Then Brittany told me during science class that she had persuaded him to invite me. She asked in front of everyone, ""Why would anyone even want you?"" I went home and cried.
Although she was seemingly perfect in everyone's eyes, I wanted to be everything that she wasn't and yet a million times more perfect. Brittany was so frightening and violent, but I wanted to be calm and not at all aggressive.
I found Brittany's online profile a few weeks ago. She still had the same chubby  face and mocking simile, and had posted half-naked pictures of herself. But as I read on, I realized that Brittany had died in a drunken driving accident a year ago. She had been 16 and pregnant at the time. Suddenly my view of Brittany changed from a bad influence into a struggling little girl whose life was taken before she could understand right from wrong. My experience with Brittany taught me that though we are all innocent in our youth, the choices we make will have great effects on us forever. I will always remember Brittany as that loud, overconfident girl. As part of that shy insecure person I used to be will always keep me modest. 
 Question:The last passage is meant to  _  . 
A. tell us the reason for Brittany's death 
B. present the changed attitude to Brittany 
C. show the influences of the youth 
D. stress the importance of behaviors 
 Answer: B
Context: Mark Eklund was in the first third grade class I taught at Saint Mary's School in Morris, Minn. He was neat in appearance, but had that happy-to-be-alive attitude that made even his occasional mischievousness   delightful. Mark liked talking. I had to remind him again and again that talking without permission was not acceptable. What impressed me so much, though, was his sincere response every time I had to correct him for misbehaving: ""Thank you for correcting me, sister!""
One day in class, I asked pupils to list the names of the other students on two sheets of paper, leaving a space between each name. Then I told them to think of the nicest thing they could say about each of their classmates and write it down. That Saturday, I wrote down the name of each student on a separate sheet of paper, and I listed what everyone else had said about that student. On Monday I gave each student his or her list. Before long, the entire class was smiling.
    Several years later, after I returned from vacation, my father met me at the airport. 
    ""Mark was killed in the war,"" he said."" The funeral is tomorrow, and his parents would like it if you could attend.""
    I had never seen a serviceman in a military coffin   before. As I stood there, Mark's father said, ""We want to show you something. They found this on Mark when he was killed."" He took a wallet out of his pocket. 
    Opening the billfold  , he carefully removed two worn pieces of notebook paper that had obviously been taped, folded and refolded many times. I knew without looking that the papers were the ones on which I had listed all the good things each of Mark's classmates had said about him.
    ""Thank you so much for doing that,"" Mark's mother said. ""As you can see, Mark treasured it.""
    That's when I finally sat down and cried. I cried for Mark and for all his friends who would never see him again. 
 Question:What did the author ask the students to write on the paper? 
A. Mistakes each student had made. 
B. Things each student liked doing. 
C. The habits of each student. 
D. The strong point of each student 
 Answer: D
Context: A woman in blue jeans stood at the window of expensive shop. Though she hesitated  for a moment, she finally went in and asked to see a dress that was in the window. The assistant who served her did not like the way she was dressed. Glancing  at her scornfully , he told her the dress was sold. The woman walked out of the shop angrily and decided to punish the assistant the next day.
She returned to the shop the following morning dressed in a fur coat, with a handbag in one hand and a long umbrella in the other. After searching out the rude assistant she asked for the same dress. Not realizing who she was, the assistant was eager to serve her this time. With great difficulty, he climbed into the shop window to get the dress. As soon as she saw it, the woman said she did not like it. She enjoy herself making the assistant bring almost everything in the window before finally buying the dress she had first asked for.

Context: ""Linda, if beating yourself up were an Olympic sport, you'd win a gold medal!""
Annabel, my close friend, stunned(...)me with that frank observation after I told her how I had mishandled a situation with a student in a third-grade class where I was substituting . ""I should never have let him go to the boy's room without a pass! It was my fault he got into trouble with the hall monitor! I'm so stupid!""
My friend burst out laughing, and then made her ""Olympic"" comment. After a brief period of reflection I had to admit that she was right. I did put myself down an awful lot. Why, just during the previous day I had called myself ""a slob"" for having some papers spread out on my desk, ""ugly"" when I left the house without makeup and ""an idiot"" when I left the house for an emergency substitute job without my emergency lesson plan.
In a more reflective tone, Annabel said, ""I once took a workshop at church where the woman in charge had us list all the mean things we say about ourselves.""
""How many did you have on your list?"" I asked.
""Fifteen,"" she confessed. ""But then the teacher said, 'Now turn to the person next to you and say all the items on your list as if you were speaking to that person!' ""
My jaw dropped,""What did you do?""
""Nothing. Nobody did. We all just sat there, until I said, 'I could never say these things to anyone else!' ""
""And our teacher replied, 'Well, if you can't say them to anyone else, then don't ever say them to yourself!' ""
My friend had a point. I would never insult a child of God---and I'm God's child, too!
God, today let me be as kind to myself as I would be to another of Your children. 
 Question:What does the writer mean by the last sentence of the passage?

Thank you very much for doing the special operation ."" Mr Lee was moved by Sam. When he was leaving, Sam said, ""Please don't tell Jason about it."" ""Well...Well...OK,"" Mr Lee replied.
Months later when Jason's wounds healed , Sam was still very sick. He couldn't see or walk. He could do nothing but stay in his wheelchair all day long.

Context: It was evening rush hour on Pacific Coast Highway in Redondo Beach, CA. Drivers lined up from traffic signal to traffic signal and were anxious to get home. On a side street merging   into this highway was a timid driver who was afraid to edge in and no one let her in. Some of the drivers backed up behind her and loudly blasted their horns. This made her more upset and nervous. 
On the right of this side street, the signal on Pacific Coast Highway turned red and traffic stopped. A driver who saw what was happening to this woman stopped a few car lengths behind her car and motioned to her to pull in front of his car. She quickly did and as he waited, two more cars dashed in behind her car. 
While the woman he'd helped waited for the signal to turn green, she sank into her driver's seat and was deeply relieved. Although this thoughtful man couldn't see it, her body language expressed her gratitude.
If you've been in a traffic situation like the one she was in, you know how upsetting it can be. But this little act of kindness allowed her to safely reach her home. She told others about this, which encouraged them to do something nice for someone else. 
This kindness spreads. Someone does something nice for you and in turn you're likely to do something nice for that person or for someone else. 
A simple act of kindness could have a widespread effect. It's like a stone that drops in a pond and causes ripples in each direction. No one knows how far those ripples will travel but they will affect everything they touch along the way. 
 Question:What can we know about most of the drivers on Pacific Coast Highway from the story? 
A. They were not friendly or thoughtful. 
B. They are thankful to the driver who helped the lady. 
C. They blasted their horns to encourage the lady driver. 
D. They were not anxious to get home.

Context: In the UK, most children have their lunches at school, but in some schools, parents can choose what their children eat. The children can have a school dinner-a hot, cooked meal; or they can take a packed  lunch with them, which usually includes cold food like sandwiches.
Often parents know what their children want. Cath, a mother of three children, told us, ""My children have packed lunches because they say they don't like to have school dinners. So I make three packed lunches every morning.""
However, another mother, Susan, made a different choice. She said, ""My daughters have a always had school dinners. I think they probably get healthier food at school than a few sandwiches I make for them.""
But how healthy are school dinners? Kaz, a father, thought poorly of them. He said, ""Fizzy  drinks were offered and I think there were a lot of chips.""
Jamie Oliver spent a year working in a school kitchen. He was worried about the unhealthy food which included burgers, pizzas and chips. So he tried to cook healthy food such as good stews and curries for the children instead.
So Jamie improved the school dinners, and trained the dinner ladies to cook healthy food in that school. Then he advised the government to improve school food across the country. And it seems that the changes have begun.
Anna, a pupil, told us, ""We used to have a fast food window where you got chips and coke, but they stopped that this year. There's a salad restaurant, which is good, so it's healthier than it was.""

Context: Miss Popular
I was awkward in middle school: bony and athletic, with a high grade in science and a low one in self-esteem. Though I had a few friends, I wasn't popular. I was picked last in football and I sometimes ate lunch by myself.
I remember the day Brittany came to our school. Her teeth were crooked , and she was a little overweight. Not that this mattered though, because she walked around like she was better than all of us. She was outspoken and incredibly frightening, making people lose confidence.
Around Brittany, I tried my best to go unnoticed. Standing out or stealing her spotlight could only result in one thing: conflict. Brittany was always the first girl picked for teams; I was lucky if I was picked at all. I was thrown the ball while she stood with the quarterback, chatting about the last party she'd gone to. I had never been to a party before or kissed a boy.
One day, a classmate asked me to the school dance. I was flattered. Then Brittany told me during science class that she had persuaded him to invite me. She asked in front of everyone, ""Why would anyone even want you?"" I went home and cried.
Although she was seemingly perfect in everyone's eyes, I wanted to be everything that she wasn't and yet a million times more perfect. Brittany was so frightening and violent, but I wanted to be calm and not at all aggressive.
I found Brittany's online profile a few weeks ago. She still had the same chubby  face and mocking simile, and had posted half-naked pictures of herself. But as I read on, I realized that Brittany had died in a drunken driving accident a year ago. She had been 16 and pregnant at the time. Suddenly my view of Brittany changed from a bad influence into a struggling little girl whose life was taken before she could understand right from wrong. My experience with Brittany taught me that though we are all innocent in our youth, the choices we make will have great effects on us forever. I will always remember Brittany as that loud, overconfident girl. As part of that shy insecure person I used to be will always keep me modest. 
 Question:The last passage is meant to  _  . 
A. tell us the reason for Brittany's death 
B. present the changed attitude to Brittany 
C. show the influences of the youth 
D. stress the importance of behaviors

Context: As Amy Hagadorn rounded the corner across the hall from her classroom, she crashed with a tall boy from the fifth grade running in the opposite direction.
""Watch it, Squirt,"" the boy yelled, as he dodged around the little third grader. Then, with an unfriendly smile on his face, the boy took hold of his right leg and mimicked the way Amy limped when she walked.
Amy closed her eyes for a moment. --Ignore him, she told herself as she headed for her classroom.
But at the end of the day, Amy was still thinking about the tall boy's mean teasing. It wasn't as if he were the only one. Amy was tired of it. Sometimes, even in a classroom full of other students, the teasing about her speech or her limping made her feel all alone.
Back home at the dinner table that evening Amy was quiet. That's why Patti Hagdorn was happy to havesome exciting news to share with her daughter.
""There's a Christmas Wish Contest on the radio station,"" she announced. ""Write a letter to Santa and you might win a prize. I think someone at this table with blond curly hair should enter.""
Amy giggled. The contest sounded like fun. She started thinking about what she wanted most for Christmas.
A smile took hold of Amy when the idea first came to her. Out came pencil and paper and Amy went to work on her letter. --Dear Santa Claus, she began.
While Amy worked away at her best printing, the rest of the family tried to guess what she might ask from Santa. Amy's sister, Jamie, and Amy's mom both thought a 3-foot Barbie Doll would top Amy's wish list. Amy's dad guessed a picture book. But Amy wasn't ready to reveal her secret Christmas wish just then. Here is Amy's letter to Santa, just as she wrote it that night:
Dear Santa Clause,
My name is Amy. I am 9 years old. I have a problem at school. Can you help me, Santa? Kids laugh at me because of the way I walk and run and talk. I have cerebral palsy . I just want one day where no one laughs at me or makes fun of me.
Love,
Amy
At radio station WJLT in Fort Wayne, Indiana, letters poured in for the Christmas Wish Contest. The workers had fun reading about all the different presents that boys and girls from across the city wanted for Christmas.
When Amy's letter arrived at the radio station, manager Lee Tobin read it carefully. He knew cerebral palsy was a muscle disorder that might confuse the schoolmates of Amy who didn't understand her disability. He thought it would be good for the people in Fort Wayne to hear about this special third grader and her unusual wish. Mr. Tobin called up the local newspaper.
The next day, a picture of Amy and her letter to Santa made the front page of the News Sentinel. The story spread quickly. All across the country, newspapers and radio and television station reported the story of the little girl in Fort Wayne, Indiana, who asked for such a simple, yet remarkable Christmas gift - just one day without teasing.
Suddenly the postman was a regular at the Hagadorn house. Envelopes of all sizes addressed to Amy arrived daily from children and adults all across the nation. They came filled with holiday greetings and words of encouragement.
During that unforgettable Christmas season, over two thousand people from all over the world sent Amy letters of friendship and support. Amy and her family read every single one. Some of the writers had disabilities; some had been teased as children. Many people thanked Amy for being brave enough to speak up. Others encouraged her to ignore teasing and to carry her head high. Each writer had a special message for Amy. Through the cards and letters from strangers, Amy glimpsed a world full of people who truly cared about each other. She realized that no amount or form of teasing could ever make her feel lonely again.
Amy did get her wish of a special day without teasing at South Wayne Elementary School. Additionally, everyone at school got an added bonus. Teachers and students talked together about how bad teasing can make others feel.
That year, the Fort Wayne mayor officially proclaimed December 21st as Amy Jo Hagadorn Day throughout the city. The mayor explained that by daring to make such a simple wish, Amy taught a universal lesson.
""Everyone,"" said the mayor, ""wants and deserves to be treated with respect, dignity and warmth.""

Amy giggled. The contest sounded like fun. She started thinking about what she wanted most for Christmas.
A smile took hold of Amy when the idea first came to her. Out came pencil and paper and Amy went to work on her letter. --Dear Santa Claus, she began.
While Amy worked away at her best printing, the rest of the family tried to guess what she might ask from Santa. Amy's sister, Jamie, and Amy's mom both thought a 3-foot Barbie Doll would top Amy's wish list. Amy's dad guessed a picture book. But Amy wasn't ready to reveal her secret Christmas wish just then. Here is Amy's letter to Santa, just as she wrote it that night:
Dear Santa Clause,
My name is Amy. I am 9 years old. I have a problem at school. Can you help me, Santa? Kids laugh at me because of the way I walk and run and talk. I have cerebral palsy . I just want one day where no one laughs at me or makes fun of me.
Love,
Amy
At radio station WJLT in Fort Wayne, Indiana, letters poured in for the Christmas Wish Contest. The workers had fun reading about all the different presents that boys and girls from across the city wanted for Christmas.
When Amy's letter arrived at the radio station, manager Lee Tobin read it carefully. He knew cerebral palsy was a muscle disorder that might confuse the schoolmates of Amy who didn't understand her disability. He thought it would be good for the people in Fort Wayne to hear about this special third grader and her unusual wish. Mr. Tobin called up the local newspaper.
The next day, a picture of Amy and her letter to Santa made the front page of the News Sentinel. The story spread quickly. All across the country, newspapers and radio and television station reported the story of the little girl in Fort Wayne, Indiana, who asked for such a simple, yet remarkable Christmas gift - just one day without teasing.
Suddenly the postman was a regular at the Hagadorn house. Envelopes of all sizes addressed to Amy arrived daily from children and adults all across the nation. They came filled with holiday greetings and words of encouragement.
During that unforgettable Christmas season, over two thousand people from all over the world sent Amy letters of friendship and support. Amy and her family read every single one. Some of the writers had disabilities; some had been teased as children. Many people thanked Amy for being brave enough to speak up. Others encouraged her to ignore teasing and to carry her head high. Each writer had a special message for Amy. Through the cards and letters from strangers, Amy glimpsed a world full of people who truly cared about each other. She realized that no amount or form of teasing could ever make her feel lonely again.
Amy did get her wish of a special day without teasing at South Wayne Elementary School. Additionally, everyone at school got an added bonus. Teachers and students talked together about how bad teasing can make others feel.
That year, the Fort Wayne mayor officially proclaimed December 21st as Amy Jo Hagadorn Day throughout the city. The mayor explained that by daring to make such a simple wish, Amy taught a universal lesson.
""Everyone,"" said the mayor, ""wants and deserves to be treated with respect, dignity and warmth.""

Context: ""Linda, if beating yourself up were an Olympic sport, you'd win a gold medal!""
Annabel, my close friend, stunned(...)me with that frank observation after I told her how I had mishandled a situation with a student in a third-grade class where I was substituting . ""I should never have let him go to the boy's room without a pass! It was my fault he got into trouble with the hall monitor! I'm so stupid!""
My friend burst out laughing, and then made her ""Olympic"" comment. After a brief period of reflection I had to admit that she was right. I did put myself down an awful lot. Why, just during the previous day I had called myself ""a slob"" for having some papers spread out on my desk, ""ugly"" when I left the house without makeup and ""an idiot"" when I left the house for an emergency substitute job without my emergency lesson plan.
In a more reflective tone, Annabel said, ""I once took a workshop at church where the woman in charge had us list all the mean things we say about ourselves.""
""How many did you have on your list?"" I asked.
""Fifteen,"" she confessed. ""But then the teacher said, 'Now turn to the person next to you and say all the items on your list as if you were speaking to that person!' ""
My jaw dropped,""What did you do?""
""Nothing. Nobody did. We all just sat there, until I said, 'I could never say these things to anyone else!' ""
""And our teacher replied, 'Well, if you can't say them to anyone else, then don't ever say them to yourself!' ""
My friend had a point. I would never insult a child of God---and I'm God's child, too!
God, today let me be as kind to myself as I would be to another of Your children. 
 Question:What does the writer mean by the last sentence of the passage? 
A. She is ready to turn to God for help. 
B. She will be kind to all children. 
C. She won't insult  herself as well as others. 
D. She is willing to be a child of God.

Context: Some people have a very poor sense of direction. Unluckily, I am one of them. I have visited a place many times but I may still get lost there the next time.
When I was a little girl, I never dared to ask strangers the way. And so I used to walk around in circles and hope that by chance I would get to the place I was going to.
Now, I am no longer too shy to ask people for directions, but I often receive helpless or even wrong information. So I try to avoid giving people wrong directions. If anyone ever asks me the way somewhere, I would say, ""Sorry, I am a stranger here.""
Once on my way to work I was stopped by a man. He asked me if I could tell him the way to the Friendship Building. I gave him my usual reply. But just as I walked on only a few steps. I realized that he had asked the way to my office building. However, I had no time to turn back and look for him. I was rushing to meet with someone at my office and I didn't want to keep him waiting.
When I just got to my office, the secretary  showed in the man who had asked me for directions. Imagine how _ I was and how surprised he was when we saw each other at the first sight. 
 Question:The Friendship Building is the place where the writer   _  . 
A. lives 
B. studies 
C. works 
D. teaches 
 Answer: C
Context: Jerry was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.
Seeing this style really made me curious, so one day I went up to Jerry and asked him, ""I don't get it! You can't be a positive person all of the time. How do you do it?"" Jerry replied, ""Each morning I wake up and say to myself, 'Jerry, you have two choices today. You can choose to be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a bad mood.' I choose to be in a good mood. Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim or I can choose to learn from it. I choose to learn from it. Every time someone comes to me complaining, I can choose to accept their complaining or I can point out the positive side of life. I choose the positive side of life. The bottom line: It's your choice how you live life."" I reflected on what Jerry said. Later, I left the restaurant industry to start my own business. We lost touch, but I often thought about him when I made a choice about life.
Several years later, I heard that Jerry did something you are never supposed to do in a restaurant business: he left the back door open one morning and was held up at gun point by three armed robbers. While trying to open the safe, he forgot the password, nervous. The robbers panicked and shot him. Luckily, Jerry was found relatively quickly and rushed to the local hospital. After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care, Jerry was released from the hospital with fragments  of the bullets still in his body.
I saw Jerry about six months after the accident. When I asked him how he was, he replied, ""The first thing that went through my mind was that I should have locked the back door,"" Jerry replied. ""Then, as I lay on the floor, I remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live, or I could choose to die. I chose to live."" ""Weren't you scared? Did you lose consciousness?"" I asked. Jerry continued, ""The doctors and nurses were great. They kept telling me I was going to be fine. But when they wheeled me into the emergency room and I saw the expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got really scared. I knew I needed to take action.""
""What did you do?"" I asked. ""Well, there was a big, strong nurse shouting questions at me,"" said Jerry. ""She asked if I was allergic  to anything. ""Yes,"" I replied. The doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited for my reply. I took a deep breath and yelled, ""Bullets!"" Over their laughter, I told them. ""I am choosing to live. Operate on me as if I am alive, not dead.""
Jerry lived thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because of his amazing attitude. I learned from him that every day we have the choice to live fully. 
 Question:What was Jerry really afraid in the emergency room? 
A. The doctors and nurses gave him up. 
B. He decided to take action to live again. 
C. He saw the expressions of the doctors and nurses. 
D. He might not be saved by doctors and nurses.

Context: When I was a boy, I was a football fan. I played football with some other boys in the backyard all the time. My mom was worried that I would get ill in the hot summer.
One day my brother gave me a new football. I came into the yard and played it excitedly. But suddenly, the ball flew through the window and nearly hit my dad. Dad said nothing. He took my football and cut it in half.
I didn't cry because I knew how terrible my mistake was. I didn't expect   to get another football. But to my surprise, Dad bought me another one the next month and told me to be more careful.

Context: He met her at the party. She was so outstanding, with many boys around her, while he was so normal, with nobody paying attention to him.
At the end of the party, he invited her to have coffee with him. She was surprised, but due to being polite, she agreed.
They sat in a nice coffee shop. He was too nervous to say anything, and she felt uncomfortable, thinking, ""Please let me go home.""
Suddenly he asked the waiter, ""Would you please give me some salt? I'd like to put it in my coffee.""
Everybody stared at him---so strange! His face turned red, but, still, he put the salt in his coffee and drank it.
She asked him curiously, ""Why do you have this hobby?""
He replied, ""When I was a little boy, I lived near the sea. I liked playing in the sea, and I could feel the taste of the sea, just like the taste of the salty coffee. Now every time I have the salty coffee, I always think of my childhood. I miss my hometown so much. I miss my parents who are still living there.""
While saying that, tears filled his eyes. She was deeply touched. That's his true feeling, from the bottom of his heart. A man who can tell about his homesickness must be a man who loves home, cares about home, and has a good sense of responsibility.
Then she also started to speak, about her faraway hometown, her childhood, her family. That was a really nice talk, also a beautiful beginning of their story.
They continued to date. She found that actually he was a man who meets all her demands: he was kind-hearted, warm and careful. He was such a good person but
!
Thanks to his salty coffee! Then the story was just like every beautiful love story, the princess married the prince, then they were living a happy life...And, every time she made coffee for him, she put some salt in the coffee.
After 40 years, he passed away, leaving her a letter which said, ""My dearest, please forgive my whole-life lie. This was the only lie I said to you ---the salty coffee.""
""Remember the first time we dated? I was so nervous at that time. Actually I wanted some sugar, but I said salt. It was hard for me to change so I just went ahead.""
""I tried to tell you the truth many times in my life, but I was too afraid to do that, as I have promised not to lie to you for anything.""
""Now I'm dying, I'm afraid of nothing so I tell you the truth: I don't like the salty coffee. What a strange and bad taste! But I have had the salty coffee for my whole life!""
""Since I knew you, I never feel sorry for anything I do for you. Having you with me is my biggest happiness for my whole life. If I can live for a second time, I still want to know you and have you for my whole life, even though I have to drink the salty coffee again.""
Her tears made the letter totally wet.
Someday, someone asked her, ""What's the taste of salty coffee?"" ""It's sweet,"" she replied.

Context: One evening I was on my daily evening return from London to my home. I had got into the habit of sitting in the last carriage at the platform, so I could get off near to the station exit at my end. One evening before getting off the train, I found a purse. I opened the purse and thought this must be my lucky day, for the purse contained some PS80 in cash. Looking further into the purse, I found credit cards, and house keys and a name and address. My first thought when seeing the cash was to pocket it, and throw the other contents away.
Now I am not a basically dishonest person, but had developed a hardened attitude over the years that most people were dishonest in some way, and my own personal experience had been that whenever I lost anything of value, that was the last I ever saw of it. And since I was a construction worker at that time, I had been the victim of a great deal of stealing during my working life.
Almost as I read the name and address, I had a picture of that woman being struck with terror, when she realized she had lost her purse, and could not get into her home, had no money, and, would have thoughts of someone spending on her credit cards, not to mention the trouble of canceling all the cards.
In that same moment I decided to hand the purse over  to the train guard. So I told him I would like to see it returned to its rightful owner. He told me would be sent to the lost property office. I arrived at my station and started to walk the five minute journey to my home all the while feeling very pleased with myself that I was going to bring a great deal of happiness to someone I did not know.

Context: Several overseas trips with the family have taught us that they can be rewarding, but you always have to be careful of pickpockets.
On a lovely visit to Paris an encounter with a pickpocket gave the would-be thief a little more than he _ 
While walking down the famous Champs Elysee, I was astonished to feel someone unzip my handbag and remove my purse. I turned to glimpse a young man turning away and pretending to be absorbed in the mouth-watering contents on display in a bakery window.
Being only a teenager at the time, I had no idea what to do. So I tapped the young man in question on the shoulder and said.
""Excuse me can you please give me back my purse?""
Of course the pickpocket had no idea what I was saying (and didn't want to know) and proceeded to shrug his shoulders and basically say (in French) ""I don't speak English""?
Meanwhile my Mother (a Scotswoman with a bad temper), came to see why I had stopped walking and what was going on. When I informed her of the situation she lost control and started yelling at the thief who still stood there making gestures in French while a crazy Scotswoman harangued  him. At this stage we were starting to attract onlookers, and when my Mother started hitting the young man with her handbag the would-be thief decided it was time to get away.
Luckily, amid all the disorder the thief lost his control of my purse, and as he made a break-for-it, my purse dropped to the ground! I quickly snatched it up and for the rest of vacation we walked around with our handbags clutched against our chests! 
 Question:This passage is a story about  _  .

Context: ""I find myself glancing at my watch to see how long I've been standing in line,"" she said. ""Everywhere I go, I notice if the dumpster gates are open or if there's trash in the parking lot."" Ms. Clark is a ""mystery shopper"", one of thousands of contract workers that companies hire to pretend as regular customers in order to judge customer service, cleanliness and whether a store is selling a product that meets company specifications  . 
Mystery shoppers can be found or, rather, not found, everywhere from restaurants and automotive shops to convenience stores and department stores. They play a constant cat-and-mouse game with store and restaurant employees and managers. However it's not all fun and games. Once in the field, a mystery shopper will typically visit several stores or restaurants per hour, taking mental notes while inside, then jotting down physical notes after they leave.
It's important for mystery shoppers to be as exact as possible, because the client companies are looking for data they can use to improve their service. The questionnaire won't say, ""Does the trash can need to be emptied?"" What an educated shopper will say is, ""The trash can to the left of the front door was overflowing with 10 pieces of trash on the ground."" Companies don't need opinion but facts.
Nowadays mystery shoppers are armed with a number of high-tech devices, such as a digital scale and a digital thermometer, as well as a handheld PC for recording the entire experience. It's a challenging job but a rewarding one. Mystery shoppers can be full time or part time, but the full-time workers tend to stick to standard mystery shopping while part-timers often choose the less complex reward-based programs. In _ , the shoppers stay disguised  only until the ""shop"" is finished, and then reveal   themselves to the store management and award prizes to employees who provided excellent service.
To be a mystery shopper, it's important to be a good observer, but sometimes it's important to have the right profile , too. Companies often hire shoppers from particular backgrounds to better blend in with clients' regular customers. If a secret shopper will be sent in, for example, to do a high-end automotive shop, the candidate must have a particular profile that meets a high-end, luxury car-type buyer profile. ""It's a challenge to perform your shop without being discovered,"" Ms. Clark said, ""because most of the people that we work for are very aware of the mystery shopping program."" 
 Question:We learn from the text that Ms. Clark_. 
A. visits some shops regularly and sometimes does something special 
B. pretends to be a shopper and evaluates the services 
C. is a government official looking into the services

Context: A ten-year-old boy from Howell, Michigan America is being hailed (...) a hero due to his persistence   that led to saving the life of an elderly neighbor. The chain of events unfolded late in the evening on Sunday, January 26th, 2014 when Danny Dipietro was being driven home from hockey practice by his dad.
That's when the young boy noticed an open garage and a figure that he believed was a dog outside an apartment near his house. Given the extremely cold weather, the young boy got a feeling that something was not right. But instead of dismissing   it like most kids at his age would have, he insisted that his mother, Dawn, go to examine what was going on. Dawn tried to convince   Danny that no one would leave a dog out in such cold weather, but he refused to take no for an answer.
Dawn finally gave in and decided to take a walk to the area with the family dog and see if there was any truth to Danny's premonition  . Sure enough, as she got closer to the apartment she noticed a garage that was wide open and a bent figure, waving madly. Upon getting there, she realized that it was not a dog that the young boy had seen, but Kathleen St. Onge, one of her neighbors. The 80-year-old had slipped on some ice in her garage and had been lying there for two hours, unable to get up.
Dawn rushed home to get her husband for help and called 911. The two then returned with some blankets to cover Ms. St. Onge, while they waited for the ambulance to arrive. Though still in hospital, the elderly woman is recovering well and grateful to Danny for his premonition. 
 Question:When Danny Dipietro's mother found the elderly woman, the elderly woman   _  . 
A. had lain in the garage for two hours 
B. was trapped in her garage with her dog 
C. was looking for her dog around the garage 
D. was lying on the ice outside the garage dead 
 Answer: A
Context: When I was six, dad brought home a dog one day, who was called ""Brownie"". My brothers and I all loved Brownie and did different things with her. One of us would walk her, another would feed her, then there were baths, playing catch and many other games. Brownie, in return, loved each other and every one of us. One thing that most touched my heart was that she would go to whoever was sick and just be with them. We always felt better when she was around.
One day , as I was getting her food, she chewed up one of dad's shoes, which had to be thrown away in the end. I knew dad would be mad and I had to let her know what she did was wrong. When I looked at her and said, ""Bad girl,"" she looked down at the ground and then went and hid. I saw a tear in her eyes.
Brownie turned out to be more than just our family pet. She went everywhere with us. People would stop and ask if they could pet her. Of course she'd let anyone pet her. She was just the most lovable dog. There were many times when we'd be out walking and a small child would come over and pull on her hair. She never barked or tried to get away. Funny thing is she would smile. This frightened people because they thought she was showing her teeth. Far from the truth, she loved everyone. 
 Question:Which of the following best describes Brownie? 
A. Shy 
B. Polite 
C. Brave 
D. Caring 
 Answer: D

That night, I didn't sleep well. My cat seemed to know I was sad and hugged me to make me feel better. On Christmas morning, I woke up and called for Marley. Then I remembered that he had gone.
Even though it was Christmas, I didn't want presents. I didn't want anything, except my friend.
Then my mum got a phone call. Someone found him! A woman saw a man on the street trying to sell a scared dog. She felt bad for the dog and used her own money(more than $200)to buy him. She took him to a vet . The vet scanned the dog for a microchip .The vet found our phone number in the microchip and called my mum.

Context: The passengers on the subway who caught a glimpse of me may have thought I was strange. In particular a gentleman sitting opposite me was always staring at me, looking at the cheese bread on the floor in front of me and then staring back at me. A passenger probably dropped it by mistake and got off at a previous stop, but the gentleman might not think so. ""Next stop, St. Patrick Station"" -- my stop was quickly coming up. I had few minutes to either take the cheese bread, which nobody else was claiming, or left it there.
In those few minutes I felt my pride getting in the way. ""What would others on the subway think of me if I took the cheese bread? Would they think that I was poor and hungry? Would they think that I was stealing?"" The ignorant thing to do was say ""yes"" to any of those _ questions. Actually, they were just my own thoughts. Though I would leave the subway, walk a block to my office, get settled at my desk, and sit comfortably in my office for the whole day, I couldn't get rid of the enormous sense of guilt and regret.
My thoughts once pushed me towards pride and ignorance, but finally I had to admit I was wrong. This missing cheese bread could be a gift for a homeless person who suffered from cold and hunger. So why not overcome a little bit of my pride and pass along so much kindness?
Just as the doors opened at my stop, I grabbed the cheese bread and left the subway. It felt awesome, but I didn't care if people were looking at me or what they were thinking. Instead of going directly to my office as usual, I walked a few more blocks up to Queen's park, where I often saw a homeless man sitting outside. I always wanted to give him something, but only today I walked toward him, who wrapped himself in a sleeping bag. I was full of satisfaction, and so did the homeless man, I thought. 
 Question:Why did the author grab the cheese bread when he got off? 
A. He noticed that no one was looking at him. 
B. He didn't want to see the cheese bread to go to taste. 
C. He valued kindness more than his own pride. 
D. He remembered a homeless man at that very moment.

Fu was very sad and angry and he decided to fight back for his father's death. He trained his army strictly until it was very strong.

Context: It seems that some people go out of their way to get into trouble. That's more or less what happened the night that Nashville Police Officer Floyd Hyde was on duty.
""I was on the way to a personal-injury accident in West Nashville. As I got onto Highway 40, blue lights and sirens   going, I fell in behind a gold Pontiac Firebird that suddenly seemed to take off quickly down the highway. The driver somehow panicked at the sight of me. He was going more than a hundred miles an hour and began passing cars on the shoulder. ""
But Hyde couldn't go after him. Taking care of injured people is always more important than worrying about speeders, so the officer had to stay on his way to the accident. But he did try to keep the Firebird in sight as he drove, hoping another nearby unit would be able to step in and stop the speeding car. As it turned out, keeping the Firebird in sight was not that difficult. Every turn the Pontiac made was the very turn the officer needed to get to the accident scene.
Hyde followed the Pontiac all the way to his destination. At that point he found another unit had already arrived at the accident scene. His help wasn't needed. Now he was free to try to stop the driver of the Firebird, who by this time had developed something new to panic about.
""Just about that time,"" Hyde says, ""I saw fire coming out from under that car, with blue smoke and oil going everywhere. He'd blown his engine. Now he had to stop. ""
""After I arrested him, I asked him why he was running. He told me he didn't have a driver's license.""
That accident cost the driver of the Firebird plenty -- a thousand dollars for the new engine -- not to mention the charges for driving without a license, attempting to run away, and dangerous driving. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is true? 
A. Someone else was taking care of the injured person. 
B. The Pontiac reached its destination at the accident scene. 
C. Hyde knew where he was going by following the right car. 
D. The policeman was running after a speeder on Highway 40.

Context: ""Well, what did I say?Buck's a real fighter, all right,"" said Francois the next morning when he discovered that Spitz had disappeared and that Buck was covered in blood.
""Spitz fought like a wolf,"" said Perrault, as he looked at the bites all over Buck.
""And Buck fought like ten wolves,"" answered Francois. ""And we'll travel faster now. No more Spitz,no more trouble.""
Francois started to harness the dogs. He needed a new lead-dog, and decided that Solleks was the best dog that he had. But Buck jumped at Solleks and took his place.
""Look at Buck!"" said Francois,laughing. ""He's killed Spitz,and now he wants to be lead-dog.Go away, Buck!""
He pulled Buck away and tried to harness Solleks again.Solleks was unhappy too. He was frightened of Buck, and when Francois turned his back,Buck took Solleks' place again. Now Francois was angry.
""I'll show you! "" he cried,and went to get a heavy club from the sledge.
Buck remembered _ ,and moved away. This time,when Solleks was harnessed as lead-dog,Buck did not try to move in.He kept a few meters away and circled around Francois carefully. But when Francois called him to his old place in front of Dave, Buck refused.He had won his fight with Spitz and he wanted to be lead-dog.
For an hour the two men tried to harness him.Buck did not run away,but he did not let them catch him.Finally,Francois sat down,and Perrault looked at his watch.It was getting late. The two men looked at one another and smiled. Francois walked up to Solleks,took off his harness, led him back and harnessed him in his old place.Then he called Buck. All the other dogs were harnessed and the only empty place was now the one at the front. But Buck did not move.
""Put down the club,"" said Perrault.
Francois dropped the club, and immediately Buck came up to the front of the team.Francois harnessed him, and in a minute the sledge was moving.
Buck was an excellent leader. He moved and thought quickly and led the other dogs well. A new leader made no difference to Dave and Solleks; they continued to pull hard.But the other dogs had had an easy life when Spitz was leading.They were surprised when Buck made them work hard and punished them for their mistakes. Pike,the second dog,was usually lazy;but by the end of the first day he was pulling harder than he had ever pulled in his life. The first night in camp Buck fought Joe,another difficult dog,and after that there were no more problems with him.The team started to pull together,and to move faster and faster.
""I've never seen a dog like Buck!"" cried Francois, ""Never! He's worth a thousand dollars. What do you think, Perrault? ""
Perrault agreed.They were moving quickly,and covering more ground every day. The snow was good and hard,and no new snow fell.The temperature dropped to 45degC below zero, and didn't change.
This time there was more ice on the Thirty Mile River, and they crossed in a day.Some days they ran a hundred kilometers,or even more. They reached Skagway in fourteen days; the fastest time ever. 
 Question:What did Francois think of Buck at the end of the passage? 
A. annoying 
B. admirable 
C. aggressive 
D. average

Context: John once told me a story about his friend, Michael. Michael happened to be on a train sitting next to a young man who seemed worried. Finally the young man told the friend that he was a convict   returning home from a prison far away. What he did had brought shame   on his family, and they had neither visited him nor written to him. He hoped, however, that this was only because they were too poor to travel and too busy to write.
When he was set free he had written to tell them he wanted to go home. To make matters easy for them, however, he had asked them to put up a signal   for him when the train passed their little farm. If the family had forgiven   him, they were to put up a white ribbon   in the big apple tree near the railway. If they didn't want him back, they were to do nothing, and he would stay on the train, and go far away.
As the train neared his hometown his _ became so great that he was afraid to look out of the window. He asked Michael to watch for the big apple tree. They changed seats. In a minute, Michael put his hand on the young convict's shoulder, ""There it is,"" His eyes was filled with sudden tears. ""It's all right. The whole tree is white with ribbons.""

Context: The prisoner had waited many months for help, but none had come. Now he felt he would do something to gain his freedom, to be free again to go about the world as he wished. But he could think of no way to run away.
He spent many hours thinking of his life before he was captured, regretting the mistakes he had made and dreaming of the joys he had known. And over and over he said to himself that he was being punished for no reason. He was guilty of no crime, but he had not been given a chance to explain the events which made him guilty.
Then one night the guard who sat outside the prisoner's door fell asleep. When he noticed this, the prisoner was struck by a feeling of hope. Perhaps he could steal the keys while the guard was sleeping.
Silently the prisoner moved toward the guard. Very gently he lifted the ring of keys from the guard's belt. Then he turned and crawled toward the door. Could he work the lock from the inside? The key turned and the door was opened. Within two minutes he had crossed the yard and climbed the wall. Then he ran across the field, free at last, a smile of joy beginning to spread across his face.

Context: On an August afternoon last year, Pamela Rivers, 40, and her friend Rita Graham, 38, were stopped at a red light on Cobb's Creek Parkway in South Philadelphia when a white SUV traveling in the opposite direction turned across traffic in front of them. It then jumped the curb   and rushed through a grassy expanse   before plunging down an embankment   toward Cobb's Creek. Pamela quickly pulled over, jumped out of her car, and dialed 911.
Kenny Gibson, 23, and his friend Taron Green, 25, were driving home from a job when Rita flagged them down. Kenny stopped, and the men got out of the car and looked over the cliff. The SUV had landed upside down in five feet of water. A woman's leg could be seen swinging out the driver's side window.
""I have a fear of water,"" Kenny said now. ""I almost drowned when I was nine."" Even so, he and Taron hurried down the 50-foot embankment into the muddy water. ""I couldn't just leave her,"" he adds.
The men waded out to the car and saw that the woman, Cheryl Allison, 61, was partially in water. Kenny tried unsuccessfully to open the door. Then he broke the window. But when he reached in to pull out Cheryl, he found she was trapped by the seat belt.
""Run back to the truck and grab a box cutter ,"" Kenny yelled to Taron. Meanwhile, Kenny tried in vain to push the car onto its side to create an air pocket for Cheryl.
That's when mechanic Marcell Porter approached the site. ""I flipped into rescue mode,"" he said. When Taron returned, Kenny cut through the seat belt with the box cutter. He and Marcell tried to pull Cheryl out, but she wouldn't come out.
Marcell broke the rear window with a rock, hoping to rescue her from the back. Then he saw that she was still strapped in by her shoulder belt. Marcell reached for the box cutter and cut the remaining strap in two. Kenny leaned in, grabbed Cheryl by the waist, and pulled her out feet first. Marcell grasped Cheryl's legs, and they managed to drag her lifeless body onto a rock.
""Give her CPR!"" Pamela yelled down to them. But the two men had no idea what to do. ""Put your mouth on her mouth and breathe,"" she shouted to Marcell. And to Kenny, ""Pump her chest!""
""We tried three times,"" said Marcell. Finally, Cheryl brought up water and started moving her fingers. The men rolled her over onto her stomach to let out more water.
Soon an ambulance arrived and transported Cheryl to the hospital, where doctors treated her. They never discovered what caused her to pass out, but she assumes it had something to do with the burning summer heat.
Over the next few days, they took turns visiting Cheryl in the hospital, where they shared hugs and tears. ""We couldn't believe she was all right,"" said Pamela.
""It's just amazing that these people came together,"" said Cheryl. She stays in touch with her ""angels"" via frequent phone calls. ""They are really beautiful people,"" she said.

Enough laws have been made to fight against pollution. The cities in Australia have little air or water pollution. The sky is blue and the water is clean. You can clearly see fish in the rivers. Plants grow very well.
Last month we visited Perth, the biggest city in Western Australia, and went to a wild flower _ . There we saw large numbers of wild flowers on show, most of which we had never seen before. We had a wonderful time. Perth is famous for its beautiful wild flowers. Every year in spring Perth has wild flower exhibitions. After visiting Perth, we spent a day in the countryside. We sat down and had a rest near a path at the foot of a hill. It was quiet and we enjoyed ourselves very much. When we heard bells ringing at the top of the hill, we looked up, but what we saw made us pick up all our things and run back to our car as quickly as we could. There were about three hundred sheep coming towards us along the path.
Australia is famous for its sheep and kangaroos . After a short drive from any town, you will find yourself among the white sheep. Sheep, sheep, everywhere you can see sheep.

Context: Father was a hardworking man who delivered bread as a living to support his wife and three children. He spent all his evenings after work attending classes, hoping to improve himself so that he could one day find a better paid job. Except for Sundays, Father hardly ate a meal together with his family. He worked and studied very hard because he wanted to provide his family with the best that money could buy. 
   Whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else. 
   The day came when the examination results were announced. To his joy, Father passed, and with distinctions too! Soon after, he was offered a good job as a senior supervisor which paid handsomely.
   Like a dream come true, Father could now afford to provide his family with life's little luxuries like nice clothing, fine food and vacation abroad.
   However, the family still did not get to see Father for most of the week. He continued to work very hard, hoping to be promoted to the position of manager. In fact, to make himself a worthily candidate for the promotion, he took another course in an open university.
   Again, whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else.
   Father's hard work paid off and he was promoted. Happily, he decided to hire a maid to relieve his wife from her domestic tasks. He also felt that their three-room flat was no longer big enough. It would be nice for his family to be able to enjoy the facilities and comfort of a condominium.    Having experienced the rewards of his hard work many times before, Father resolved to further his studies and work at being promoted again. The family still did not get to see much of him. In fact, sometimes Father had to work on Sundays entertaining clients.
   Over again, whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else.
   As expected, Father's hard work paid off again and he bought a beautiful condominium overlooking the coast of Singapore. On the first Sunday evening at their new home, Father declared to his family that he decided not to take any more courses or pursue any more promotions. From then on he was going to devote more time to his family, and it was a promise. 
   Father did not wake up the next day.

Context: Change Has Come to America
November, 04, 2008, Barack Obama
Hello, Chicago.
If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.
It's the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen.
A little bit earlier this evening, I received an extraordinarily gracious call from Sen. McCain. Sen. McCain fought long and hard in this campaign. And he's fought even longer and harder for the country that he loves. He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine. We are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader.
I congratulate him; I congratulate Gov. Palin for all that they've achieved. And I look forward to working with them to renew this nation's promise in the months ahead.
I want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart, and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on the train home to Delaware, the vice president-elect of the United States, Joe Biden.
And I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last 16 years the rock of our family, the love of my life, the nation's next first lady Michelle Obama.
Sasha and Malia I love you both more than you can imagine. And you have earned the new puppy that's coming with us to the new White House.
To my sister Maya, my sister Alma, all my other brothers and sisters, thank you so much for all the support that you've given me. I am grateful to them.
And to my campaign manager, David Plouffe, the unsung hero of this campaign, who built the best -- the best political campaign, I think, in the history of the United States of America.
To my chief strategist David Axelrod who's been a partner with me every step of the way.
To the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics you made this happen, and I am forever grateful for what you've sacrificed to get it done.
But above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to. It belongs to you. It belongs to you. 
 Question:Why did Sen. McCain make a phone call to the writer? 
A. To inform the writer of something important. 
B. To share his happiness with the writer. 
C. To congratulate the writer on his success. 
D. To give him some good ideas on making a successful speech.. 
 Answer: C
Context: The new mayor of Hillsdale, Michigan, is a man of the people, ready to listen to their problems, but only until 6 p.m. Then he has to do his homework. Michael Sessions, 18, beat former mayor Douglas Ingles, 51, by just two votes and became the new mayor of Hillsdale. He is America's youngest mayor.
As Sessions was too young to enter the election in the spring of 2005, he registered- to vote on Sept. 22, one day after his 18-year-old birthday. The day after that he started his write-in campaign, which means he should persuade voters to remember his name and write it by hand on the voting ballots .
To help get his name known, Sessions earned$700 by selling apples over the summer. He spent the money on posters and put them on the Hillsdale's lawns.
Sessions' month-long campaign included going door to door, explaining his ideas of the town's future in the kitchens of his neighbors. ""They'd look at me, and say'How old are you again? How much experience do you have?'And I say'I'm still in high school', ""he said. Sessions promised Hillsdale's voters he would renew local economy. ""I was hopeful the whole time, ""he explained. One day he spent so long out on the streets knocking on the doors that he ended up in a hospital emergency room.
Sessions said that his schoolwork will not get in the way of his job as a mayor. ""From 7:50 a.m. to 2:30p.m., I'11 be a student. From 3 to 6, I'11 be the mayor of Hillsdale,"" he said.
""He did a very brave thing that couldn't have been easy for him to do, ""said Jack Vettel, a councilman in Hillsdale, a city of 8,200 about 75 miles southwest of Detroit. ""He does care about this town. He's been here all his life. ""
Sessions will receive$3, 600 a year during his four-year term, and will work out of his bedroom since the town does not provide the mayor with an office. 
 Question:What can we infer from the passage? 
A. American mayors usually work from 3 p. m. to 6 p. m. 
B. In America, young people are encouraged to get involved in politics. 
C. All teenagers are allowed to enter political elections. 
D. American mayors receive a salary of 3, 600 a year during their 4-year term. 
 Answer: B
Context: It all began with a stop at a red light.
Kevin Salwen was driving his 14-year-old daughter, Hannah, back from a sleepover in 2006 . While waiting at a traffic light, they saw a black Mercedes Coupe on one side and a homeless man begging for food on the other.
""Dad, if that man had a less nice car, that man there could have a meal.""Hannah protested. The light changed and they drove on, but Hannah was too young to be reasonable. She pestered  her parents about _ insisting that she wanted to do something.
""What do you want to do?"" her mom responded. ""Sell our house?""
Warning! _ . Hannah seized upon the idea of selling the luxurious family home and donating half the proceeds to charity, while using the other half to buy a more modest replacement home.
Eventually, that's what the family did. The project --crazy, impetuous   and utterly inspiring -- is written down in detail in a book by father and daughter scheduled to be published next month: ""The Power of Half."" It's a book that, frankly, I'd be nervous about leaving around where my own teenage kids might find it. An impressionable child reads this, and the next thing you know your whole family is out on the street.
At a time of enormous needs in Haiti and elsewhere, when so many Americans are trying to help Haitians by sending everything from text messages to shoes, the Salwens offer an example of a family that came together to make a difference -- for themselves as much as the people they were trying to help. In a column a week ago, it described neurological evidence from brain scans that unselfishness lights up parts of the brain normally associated with more primary satisfaction. The Salwens' experience confirms the selfish pleasures of selflessness.
Mr. Salwen and his wife, Joan, had always assumed that their kids would be better off in a bigger house. But after they downsized, there was much less space to retreat to, so the family members spent more time around each other. A smaller house unexpectedly turned out to be a more family-friendly house. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage? 
A. Mercedes Coupe is only an ordinary car which is quite cheap. 
B. Unselfishness has nothing to do with people's primary satisfaction. 
C. Hannah asked her parents to do something charitable and they sold their house. 
D. The writer's children asked him to sell their house.

Context: We're trying to decide where to go on our vacation this summer.  We usually go to Lake Arrowheads for a few weeks, but we'd like to go somewhere else this year. We're tired of doing the same thing summer after summer. Some friends of ours suggested us go to Hawaii. That would be wonderful. I' m sure we would enjoy a trip like that, but of course it's impossible. First, it would be rather expensive, and second, there would not be enough time. If we're lucky enough to save some money between now and next summer, and if I'm lucky enough to get four weeks of vacation instead of two weeks, maybe we can go to Hawaii next year. In fact, if we wanted to plan a trip like that, it would be good to stay home and not to go to any place. That's one way we could begin to save some money for next year's trip. Also, if we were to stay here, I would like to work instead of taking two weeks off: then maybe my boss would suggest that I should be given four weeks' vacation instead of two weeks. 
 Question:If they had decided to go to Hawaii this summer, the writer  _ 
A. would go there , too 
B. would go to Lake Arrowhead 
C. would stay home or work 
D. would stop them going there. 
 Answer: C

Context: The Wilsons decided to go overseas for vacation. They had a family meeting to plan the vacation. ""First,"" Mr. Wilson said, ""we should decide where we are going.""
""I don't agree,"" Mrs. Wilson said, ""I think we should decide when we are going first. We don't want to go to places when they are cold."" [:Zxxk.Com]

Context: Father was a hardworking man who delivered bread as a living to support his wife and three children. He spent all his evenings after work attending classes, hoping to improve himself so that he could one day find a better paid job. Except for Sundays, Father hardly ate a meal together with his family. He worked and studied very hard because he wanted to provide his family with the best that money could buy. 
   Whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else. 
   The day came when the examination results were announced. To his joy, Father passed, and with distinctions too! Soon after, he was offered a good job as a senior supervisor which paid handsomely.
   Like a dream come true, Father could now afford to provide his family with life's little luxuries like nice clothing, fine food and vacation abroad.
   However, the family still did not get to see Father for most of the week. He continued to work very hard, hoping to be promoted to the position of manager. In fact, to make himself a worthily candidate for the promotion, he took another course in an open university.
   Again, whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else.
   Father's hard work paid off and he was promoted. Happily, he decided to hire a maid to relieve his wife from her domestic tasks. He also felt that their three-room flat was no longer big enough. It would be nice for his family to be able to enjoy the facilities and comfort of a condominium.    Having experienced the rewards of his hard work many times before, Father resolved to further his studies and work at being promoted again. The family still did not get to see much of him. In fact, sometimes Father had to work on Sundays entertaining clients.
   Over again, whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else.
   As expected, Father's hard work paid off again and he bought a beautiful condominium overlooking the coast of Singapore. On the first Sunday evening at their new home, Father declared to his family that he decided not to take any more courses or pursue any more promotions. From then on he was going to devote more time to his family, and it was a promise. 
   Father did not wake up the next day. 
 Question:Father worked and studied very hard because   _  . 
A. he had to support his family 
B. he wanted to bring his family a better life

 Answer: B
Context: Peter, a high school student, was pretty busy with school, and he was on the soccer team. High school was hard, because everyone wanted to have nice clothes, hang out, drive cars, and all these cost money. Peter's father was the sort of guy that believed you had to earn whatever you got, so he wasn't just about to hand over lots of money for Peter to use to have fun. So, he had to get a job.
During his freshman year summer vacation, his classmate got him a job working on a hay   farm. He threw hay up into wagons as the tractor drove around fields, and then they stacked   it in the hot barn. It was a hot, lowpaying job.
He once worked a few nights a week at a grocery store. He put things on the shelf. It was a lot of lifting and carrying, and his arms were strong from this and the previous job. It was dull and didn't pay much.
He took some time off when soccer got serious, but the following summer he tried working at a lumber yard. It was hot outside, but he got a lot of exercise lifting and carrying things like boards and drywall. He also learned a lot about building supplies. It still didn't pay well.
From there, he spent a year doing some tutoring for a friend of the family, but that was piecemeal. His first real job came the last year at school, when he fixed registers and worked on computers at a big box store. It was his favorite job yet, but it still didn't pay well.
What Peter realized with all of these jobs was that he needed a better paying job! The only way to get that was to get trained or educated. He could go to school and get a 2year degree in an office or technical position. His other choices were going to a 4year college or joining the army. He wasn't sure what he was going to do yet, but he knew he had to do something. Jobs were a lot of work, money was hard to earn, but he liked staying busy and being able to buy things. Peter wanted the most out of life, and that meant education. 
 Question:All the jobs Peter had taken had one thing in common:  _  . 
A. They were done during his vacation 
B. They were dull and tiresome 
C. They needed hard labour 
D. They didn't pay well

A learning population is healthier, more tolerant(,), independent and fulfilled. Learning can take place in a range of styles: anytime, anywhere, anyhow.
None of us learn in isolation(,). There are a whole range of factors that can affect us in learning. The key factors affecting people's learning include: *their resources *their image of learning *the rewards associated with any learning activity *the availability of information about learning opportunities *the climate created by government and employers in which learning takes place

Context: I went through a training program and became a literacy volunteer last surnmen The training
I received, though excellent, did not tell me how it was to work with a real student, however. When I began to discover what other people's lives were like because they could not read, I realized the true importance of reading.
My first student Marie was a 44-year-old single mother of three. In the first lesson, I found out she walked two miles to the nearest supermarket twice a week because she didn't know which bus to take. When I told her I would get her a bus schedule, she told me it would not help because she could not  read it. She said she also had difficulty once she got to the supermarket,because she couldn't always remember what she needed. Since she did not know words, she could not write out a shopping list. Also, she could only recognize items by sight, so if the product had a different label, she would not recognize it as the product she wanted.
As we worked together, learning how to read built Marie's self-confidence,which encouraged her to continue her studies. She began to make rapid progress and was even able to take the bus to the supermarketelt. After this successful trip, she reported how self-confident she felt. At the end of the program, she began helping her youngest son,Tony, a shy first grader with his reading. She sat with him before he went to sleep and together they would read bedtime stories. When his eyes became wide with excitement as she read, pride was written all over her face. As she described this experience, I was proud of myself as well. I found that helping Marie to build her self-confidence was more rewarding than anything I had ever done before.
As a literacy volunteer, I learned a great deal about teaching and helping others. In fact, I may have learned more from the experience than Marie did. 
 Question:How did Marie use to find the goods she wanted in the supermarket? 
A. She knew where the goods were in the supermarket 
B. She asked others to take her to the right place 
C. She managed to find the goods by their looks 
D. She remembered the names of the goods

Context: When someone gives you advice, listen without judgment, try to find value in what you're hearing, and say: ""Thank you"". This wise advice is easy to understand yet hard to practice. I'll give you an example from my life when I totally  _ in terms of practicing what I teach.  
In my work I travel constantly. I always put off going to the airport until the last second. My wife, Lyda, was sitting next to me in the front seat. I was racing along and not paying much attention. Lyda cried out: ""Look out! There is a red light up ahead. ""  
Being a trained behavioral science professional--who teaches others the value of encouraging advice--I naturally screamed at her: ""I know there is a red light up ahead! Don't you think I can see?"" When we arrived at the airport, Lyda didn't speak to me. I wondered why she seemed mad at me.  
During the flight to prefix = st1 /New York, I did a cost-benefit analysis. I asked myself: ""What was the cost of just listening when Lyda called out the warning? Zero."" I then reasoned: ""What was the potential benefit? What could have been saved?"" Several potential benefits came to mind, including her life, my life, and the lives of other people.  
I landed in New Yorkfeeling ashamed of myself. I immediately called Lyda and told her my cost-benefit story. I convinced her: ""The next time you help me with my driving, I am just going to say, 'Thank you.'""  
A few months passed, and I had long forgotten the incident. Again, I was racing off to the airport, when Lyda cried out: ""Look out for the red light!"" I was embarrassed, and then shouted: ""Thank you!""  
I'm a long way from perfect, but I'm getting better. My suggestion is that you get in the habit of asking the important people in your life how you can do things better. And be ready for an answer. Some people may tell you things like ""Look out for the red light."" When this happens, remember that there is possibly some potential benefit. Then just say: ""Thank you."" 
 Question:The purpose of the passage is to advise people to_. 
A. do a cost-benefit analysis in daily life 
B. treasure others' suggestions 
C. learn from the author's experiences 
D. discover potential benefits

Context: My friend Alice decided to be a nurse when she was four years old. She always to play at ""doctors and nurses"" with her playmates. When she left school last year, she still wanted to be a real nurse. 
Late September she started her studies in a big hospital in Newcastle. She had to work very hard. She went to classes every day and studied late at night. Then a really important day came: her first day in a ward  . At last she was really helping sick people, not just sitting in classes or learning from books. 
At first, student nurses do lots of odd jobs in the ward. They help to serve meals, or wash the patients. They also keep the ward tidy and make the beds. But they cannot give injections or help the doctors. 
One of Alice's first jobs was in a ward of old people. She was told to clean all the patients' false teeth. She collected all the teeth and took them to the bathroom. Instead of cleaning each set of teeth one by one, she put them all into a big bowl. 
""It'll be quicker this way,"" she said to herself. ""Then I can give back everyone's teeth in a few minutes."" 
Give back everyone's teeth! Alice stood in the middle of the ward with her big bowl of teeth. She had no idea which teeth belonged to which old man! You can imagine the confusion  of the next half-hour when each patient came to find his own teeth!

C. to wash the patients 
D. to keep the ward tidy

It all started when Charlene, one of my co-volunteers at the library, asked if I could do her duty on Tuesday since her doctor appointment had been unexpectedly changed. I agreed, which meant I  was home on Friday instead of volunteering as previously planned.
My daughter, Mary, managers a book store in town. Mid-morning, she called to ask me for help. Would I buy a fifty dollar gift card, birthday card, and cake for one of Mary's assistant managers, Cindy?

Cindy insisted that it was just fine. But that was not what Mary thought, so she gathered enough money from other employees to throw a surprise party for Cindy. Since neither Mary, nor any of the other employees, could leave to pick up the _ , they were turning to me for help. Days later, Mary told me the wonderful rest of the story, ""Cindy cried and cried when we surprised her.

Context: A recent survey by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) found that about a third of nurses inprefix = st1 /UKplanned to give up their jobs in the next two years because of the amount of worries and unhappiness with their pay.
   Among those under 40, the percentage of nurses planning to leave their employers increased from 32% in 2005 to 36% in 2007.
The survey also found that 71% of nurses believed they could be paid more for less effort if they left nursing, compared to 60% in 1997.
   The research was published as the RCN hosted a meeting for nurse leaders to deal with the growing concerns of the nurses.
   Josie Irwin, an RCN expert, said, "" Many nurses say that changes in junior doctors' hours have resulted in an increase in their workload. Nurses are under more and more pressure.""
   Ms Irwin added, ""Only 22% of all nurses disagree that they are under too much pressure.""
   She also said that 27% of nurses had a second job, with the main reason that they needed some extra income.
   ""Nurses have made it clear that while they enjoy their work, they have more to do than ever and are not being paid enough to do it."" She added. "" For this reason, the RCN is calling for a pay increase for nurses to bring their pay into line with others.""
   The survey of 4,795 nurses found that some important changes to the profession had taken place in recent years. The average age of the nurses questioned was 42 ---compared to an average of 33 in 1987. The RCN said that the age increase was because people were now becoming nurses later. In the 1960s, the average age of a nurse on the completion of training was 21, but over the last 5 years it has been an average of 29. 
 Question:From the passage we know  _  . 
A. 27% of the nurses have another job for extra income. 
B. Only 27% of all nurses agree that they are under too much pressure. 
C. people are envious of the nurses' job 
D. Few changes to the profession of the nurses have taken place in recent years.

Context: I was eleven years old, waiting for my exam at Saraswati Vidyalaya, my school in Nagpur. ""No. 12, please come forward."" Kirti, a very fat girl from my class, stepped ahead. I heard my classmates laughing and so I tried to stop them with my eyes. But my good intentions were mistaken. The next morning, my teacher, Mrs. Kamble, told me, ""Ashwini, I've received a complaint about you."" I was shocked. The girl I was protecting thought I'd been laughing at her.
I tried to explain but the teacher refused to hear me out. She punished me by making me stand by the door. I knew I was right. Such punishment to a class topper was simply unheard of. But, slowly, my pride disappeared. Instead of being angry, I understood the other students who have been punished at times. For the first time, I felt humbled  .
Three years later, I was in the math class. Mr. Prabhuraman, wrote an equation   -- one he'd taught us the day before -- on the blackboard. ""Anyone who doesn't know how to solve this,"" he said, ""please leave the class at once."" I knew I could solve only the first two steps. But my pride made me stay there. Unfortunately, the one who was asked to solve it was me. I just stood there, chalk in hand, trying not to look foolish. I prepared myself for a good talking-to  , but Mr. Prabhuraman told me kindly, ""Go back to your seat.""
Today, two decades later, those incidents have made me think. One teacher punished me for something I didn't do; the other forgave me for something I did wrong. Both experiences had an effect on me. They remind me that no matter what you accomplish  , you must always be humble. 
 Question:When the very fat girl appeared, Ashwini   _  . 
A. took no notice of her 
B. laughed at her 
C. said hello to her 
D. tried to stop others making fun of her

Context: When I was at university,  I studied very hard. But a lot of my friends did very little work. Some did just enough to pass exams. Others didn't do quite enough. Fred Baines was one of them. He spent more time drinking in the Students' Union than working in the library. Once, at the end of the term, we had to take an important test in chemistry. The test had a hundred questions. Beside each question we had to write ""True"" or ""False"". While I was studying in my room the night before the test, Fred was watching television.

""Oh good,"" he said, ""Have you got the results of the test?""
The professor looked at him and smiled.
""Ah, it's you, Baines, just a minute.""

Ten minutes before the bus was to arrive, he asked me to take him in my car. I complained about it being at the last minute. I said ""no"" at first. He begged me again and I finally agreed.

We walked into his school together. He remembered where his new classroom was and recognized his teacher from the ice cream social party they had the day before. He sat down at his desk and chatted with a few of his classmates. He took a few photos of them (with a camera phone because I didn`t allow him to bring the real camera) and then he said in a very serious manner, ""Mom, you can go home now. I`ll be OK."" And so he was.

Context: Mr. Smith is well known in Washington because of his many social blunders. He always likes to attend the various social functions because he wants to expand his circle of friends. Whenever he is invited, he goes, unless he is ill.
Recently he received an invitation to a fashionable banquet. Although he did not know the hostess, he accepted the invitation. He was secretly very pleased, because he felt that his reputation as a desirable guest was growing.
When he arrived at the banquet hall, he found that about one hundred people had been invited. He began to move a-round the hall. He spoke to other guests whether he knew them or not. He soon realized that he had never met any of the other people present, although they seemed to know each other.
At dinner he was seated beside a very dignified woman. The woman tried to be friendly even though she had never met Mr. Smith before. She spoke politely whenever he spoke to her. Between the first and the second course of the meal, she, turned to Mr. Smith and said, ""Do you see that gray-haired man at the end of the table? The one with glasses.""

""He's the Secretary of the Interior!"" she replied.
Mr. Smith said, ""So that's the secretary of the Interior! I' m afraid that I find very little to admire about him, although he is the Secretary.""
The woman stiffened and did not reply. Mr. Smith continued in spite of her coldness. ""I really can't see how he received his appointment unless he is perhaps a relative of the President.""
""It hardly matters whether you like the Secretary or not,"" she said. ""He was chosen because the President thought he was the man for the job. If he does the job well, you should have no complaint.""
""That's just it,"" persisted Mr. Smith. ""No one does the things he does, unless he is a complete fool!""
""Sir!"" said the woman in all her dignity. ""Do you know who I am?"" ""No,"" replied Mr. Smith.
""I am the Secretary's wife,"" she said coldly. Mr. Smith was shocked, but he went on in spite of his embarrassment. ""Madam, do you know who I am?""
""No, I don't,"" the woman replied.
""Thank goodness!"" exclaimed Mr. Smith, as he quickly left the table.

Context: One evening last fall, while Marcos Ugarte did his homework and his father, Eduardo, a teacher, prepared lesson plans, they heard shouting outside. Eduardo, 47, and Marcos, 15, stepped onto the balcony  of their two-story home. Immediately, Marcos' s eye was caught by a flame from one of their neighbors' houses.
""Dad, the house is on fire!"" Marcos cried. Dressed only in shorts, the barefoot teen
dashed towards the Mas' home with his dad. Grandmother Yim Ma, mother Suzanne Ma, and son Nathan Ma were gathered on the front grassland shouting for help. When the Ugartes got there, they saw through the open front door that father Alex Ma was falling down the stairs, coughing, his face black with dirt.
""Is anyone else in the house?"" Eduardo asked.
""My son!"" Alex managed to say, pointing to the second floor.
Eduardo started up the stairs, but thick, black smoke, swirling ash, and extreme heatforced him to his knees. He inched upstairs and down the hall where Alex said he would find Cody, eight, who had locked himself in a bedroom. ""I'd never seen smoke like that,"" says Eduardo. ""My glasses immediately turned black from the ash.""
As the fire spread across the hall, Eduardo banged on the bedroom door and tried to turn the handle. But Cody didn't respond, and Eduardo made his way back downstairs. At the same time, Marcos saw Yim and Suzanne pulling an aluminum  ladder out of the garage. ""Cody was standing at the window, screaming for help,"" says Marcos.
""I knew I had to do something."" He grabbed the ladder, positioned it near the window, and climbed towards the boy. When Marcos reached the window, he pushed the screen into the room and persuaded Cody out. ""It's OK,"" Marcos told him. ""I've got you."" Holding Cody with one arm, Marcos moved down the ladder. Halfway down, he handed the boy to a neighbor.
The day after the fire, Alex visited Marcos. ""Thank you for saving my son,"" Alex said. ""You are his hero forever.""

Context: Stacey Hillman, who is 10 years old, was reading a magazine about police dogs needing bulletproof vests  . She thought that someone should start raising money for the police dogs.
After she got permission from Chief LaBrusciano, she went to the County Sheriff Don Eslinger. She got busy visiting all the police dogs and telling the departments about her new charity. She made ""collection boxes"" by using bottles and put a picture of her with a police dog on it. She put these bottles in vet's offices and pet stores.
The Chief from her hometown police department helped make Stacey's idea an official charity -- Pennies to Protect Police Dogs. The more money she collected, the more popular she became, and the more people offered to donate and help her with her goal   of giving every police dog effective protection. 
Stacey travels all around her state to raise money and tell people how important the police dogs are. She speaks at schools, and they donate to her charity, too. Since Stacey started her charity, she has bought bulletproof vests for the police dogs with all the 140 thousand dollars she has raised. But she has many more K-9 friends that still need to be protected and she promises to keep doing her charity until every police dog in the whole country has a bulletproof vest.
Each vest costs $700, and every police dog should have one. There are not always tax dollars to provide K-9s with these vests, and very few departments have them. The police dogs save lives just like police officers do, and often the police dogs are the first to go in. Stacey depends on donations from everyone to provide the dogs with bulletproof vests. 
 Question:How many bulletproof vests has Stacey bought for the police dogs? 
A. 100. 
B. 140. 
C. 200. 
D. 700. 
 Answer: C
Context: Kathy started at my nursery school at the age of three. She settled into the group easily, and would be first on the slide and highest up the climbing frame. She could put on her coat without help and not only fasten her own buttons but other children's too.
She was a lovely child but unfortunately a scratcher. If anyone upset her or stood in her way, her right hand would flash out fast and scratch down the face of her playmates. Children twice her age would fly in fear from her.
This must have been very rewarding for Kathy but obviously it had to be stopped. All the usual ways failed and then I remembered and account by G. Atkinson of prefix = st1 /HighfieldSchool, of how fights in the playground had been stopped. No punishment had been given, but the attacker had been ignored and the victims rewarded. So I decided to try this out on Kathy.
With a pocketful of Smarties I followed Kathy around. She was so quick that it was impossible to prevent her scratching, but I was determined to stay within arm's length all afternoon.
All was peaceful but then I saw Kathy's hand moved and heard the scream. Gently I gathered up the little hurt one in my arms and said ""Nice, nice sweetie"" and I put a Smartie into her mouth. Kathy opened her mouth, expecting a Smartie and then looked puzzled when she got nothing.
Soon came another scream, this time from John. While holding him in my arms, I said, ""Look, Kathy, a nice Smartie for John"" and put it into John's mouth.
A smile of understanding flashed across Kathy's face, Minutes later, she came to me and said loudly, ""Give me a Smartie! I have hurt my finger!""
""No,"" I replied, ""you'll get it if someone hurts you.""
On purpose, she turned and scratched a nearby boy. Tom, and waited quietly while I mothered and rewarded him, then she walked away.
She has never scratched a child since.
Parents who find older children  _ younger brothers and sisters might do well to replace shouting and punishment by rewarding and more attention to the injured ones. It's certainly much easier and more effective. 
 Question:From the passage, we know that Kathy is_. 
A. sensitive but slow 
B. smart but a bit rude 
C. independent but selfish 
D. quick but sort of passive 
 Answer: B
Context: First aid is the aid or the help which can be given to an injured person first, that is, before any other help comes. Nowadays there is usually a telephone not far away and the first we should do, if a serious accident happens, call the phone for an ambulance. Sometimes our quick action may save someone's life.
Shock. People often suffer from shock after receiving an injury, sometimes even when the injury is very tiny. The face turns grey, and the skin becomes damp   and cold. They breathe quickly. They should be kept warm. Cover them with a blanket and give them a warm drink.

Context: Rabbit Shiny and tortoise  Smily were neighbours. One day they were reading a story about their great grandfathers: Shiny's and Smily's great grandfathers decided to have a race. While Shiny's great grandfather went to sleep during the race, Smily's great grandfather won the race by slowly walking towards the finish line.
Smily said, ""If your great grandfather didn't go to sleep, my great granddad might never win. So his win was not a real win.""
The next day there was a notice in the jungle  newspaper. It said that there would be a race and the winner would win many prizes. The race started from the bear's house. From there, the runners had to cross the river. But most of the animals could not both run fast and swim fast. So they didn't know what to do. Shiny and Smily made a plan.
Shiny ran, while smily was sitting on his back. He and other animals, like the deer, reached the river side at the same time. But they saw the swift water and stood there because they were worried. None of them liked the idea of crossing the river. Smily quickly got into the water and Shiny sat on his back. Smily started swimming. Soon they reached the other side of the river. Shiny got down from Smily's back and Smily climbed on Shiny's back again. Shiny ran fast. They reached the finish line first.
""Both of them are the winners."" The president of the jungle said, ""Shiny and Smily helped each other during the race and they won. So let's give them a big hand.""

Context: Once a 10-year-old boy decided to learn judo   though he had lost his left arm in a car accident.
The boy began lessons with an old Japanese sensei, a judo teacher. Three months later, he was still practising with the same move. So he asked, ""Sensei, shouldn't I be learning more moves?""
""This is the only move you know, but this is the only move you'll ever need to know,"" the sensei replied.
The boy kept training. Months later, the sensei took him to his first match.
Surprisingly, the boy easily won his first two matches. The third match was more difficult, but after some time, his opponent   became impatient. The boy used his one move to win the match and now was in the final.
This time, his opponent was bigger, stronger, and more experienced. For a while, the boy seemed to lose the game. Being worried that the boy might get hurt, the referee   called a break. Just before the referee wanted to end the match, the sensei came to him.
""No,"" the sensei said, ""let him go on."" Soon after the match began, his opponent made a big mistake: he dropped his guard  . Suddenly, the boy won the match.
On the way home, the boy and the sensei talked about every move in each match. Then the boy gathered the courage to ask, ""Sensei, how did I win the match with only one move?""
""You won for two reasons,"" the sensei answered. ""First, you've learned one of the most difficult throws in all of judo. Second, the only known guard for that move is for your opponent to catch your left arm."" 
 Question:From the passage we can infer that   _  . 
A. disabled people are the best ones in learning judo

Context: While watching the Olympics the other night, I came across an unbelievable sight. It was not a gold medal, or a world record broken, but a show of courage.
The event was swimming and started with only three men on the blocks. For one reason or another, two of them false started, so they were disqualified. That left only one to compete. It would have been difficult enough, not having anyone to race against, even though the time on the clock is important.
I watched the man dive off the block and knew right away that something was wrong. I'm not an expert swimmer, but I can tell a good dive from a poor one, and this was not exactly medal quality. When he resurfaced, it was evident that the man was not out for gold - his arms were waving in an attempt at freestyle. The crowd started to laugh. Clearly this man was not a medal competitor.
I listened to the crowd begin to laugh at this poor man who was clearly having a hard time. Finally he made his turn to start back. It was pitiful. He made a few desperate strokes and you could tell he was worn out.
But in those few awful strokes, the crowd had changed.
No longer were they laughing, but beginning to cheer. Some even began to stand and shout ""Come on, you can do it!"" and he did.
A clear minute past the average swimmer, this young man finally finished his race. The crowd went wild. You would have thought that he had won the gold, and he should have. Even though he recorded one of the slowest times in Olympic history, this man gave more heart than any of the other competitors.
Just a short year ago, he had never even swum, let alone race. His country had been invited to Sydney.
In a competition where athletes remove their silver medals feeling they have somehow been cheated out of gold, or when they act so proudly in front of their competitirs, _ . 
 Question:From the passage we can learn that the young man  _  . 
A. made his turn to start back pitifully 
B. was skillful in freestyle in the game 
C. swam faster than the average swimmer 
D. was not capable enough to win the medal

Context: In 2006, young businessman Blake Mycoskie went to Argentina on vacation. He went back to America with a business plan that would help thousands of children. While on vacation, Mycoskie saw children who couldn't afford even one pair of shoes. Their feet suffered cuts, and he wanted to help. He noticed the shoes that Argentinean farmers wore. Inspired by those simple shoes with rope bottoms, he had an idea. Mycoskie wanted to give these children the shoes they needed. He gave his new plan a name --- TOMS. For every pair of shoes he sold, he would give a new pair to a needy child. One for one.
  It was a slap  in the face to traditional business practices. How could he make a profit by giving so much away? However, he started selling shoes out of his apartment. When he had sold 10,000 pairs of shoes, he returned to Argentina with 10,000 pairs to give away.
  Although often taken for granted, shoes play an important role. Children without shoes easily injure their feet. They can catch a disease through soil that could make them sick or slow down their growth. Some children can't attend school without shoes because they are part of the uniform.
  TOMS, together with other charity organizations, continues to find communities that will get benefit. Since that first ""shoe drop"" in Argentina, TOMS has contributed new shoes to communities in Asia, Africa, and Central and South America.
  Mycoskie's special principle is all about giving. This has attracted a lot of media attention, saving money on marketing. When people hear about TOMS' purpose, they buy the shoes and then share the story with a slogan of ""shoes for a better tomorrow"". 
 Question:When he was on vacation, Blake Mycoskie   _  . 
A. created a new kind of shoes with rope bottoms 
B. wanted to donate money to people in need 
C. found children suffering from a lack of shoes 
D. gave 10,000 pairs of shoes to Argentineans

Context: Ellen and Bill County are both teachers. They met in college and became good friends because of their shared love for children. Two years after the couple got married, Ellen saw a huge change in the life of one of her students, a 9 - year - old girl. Three years earlier both of the little girl's parents had died and there was no one to take care of her. She was taken away to live in a government office. But finally she was taken in and adopted by a family and became their daughter. Ellen said that she noticed the difference in the child's life after she was placed in a permanent home and thought that maybe she and her husband could help a child in a similar way.
They decided to become temporary parents and to take a child into their home just on the weekends when the real parents could not take care of him or her. The pair planned to have their own children in a few years, but decided that this would be a way to give to the community in the meantime.
The couple quickly grew to love one of the children they looked after. When he became legally available, Billy became the first child they took in permanently. Six months after adopting Billy, Ellen was told by her doctor that she was unable to have children naturally. Ellen says she knew then that adoption was the way she was meant to have a family.
Since adopting Billy, now 17, Ellen and Bill have adopted five more children -- Rose, 16; Albert, 11; Joshua, 5 and in June 2003, they added biological brother and sister Tyler and Rylee to the County family. The County family has been recognized for their work on adoption, and has received many awards for their efforts.  Last June,  the family was even interviewed on  the television show, ""Adoption Stories"".
Ellen says she would like to encourage other families to adopt children. She adds that the best part of being a mother of six is: ""Giving Josh a bath, putting a band-aid on a cut knee or just the everyday Mom things, that makes motherhood such an honor and a privilege."" 
 Question:Why did Ellen and Bill first decide to adopt a child? 
A. Because they had always loved students very much. 
B. Because they saw the benefits of adoption for a child. 
C. Because they were not able to have children of their own. 
D. Because they want to receive awards for their community work. 
 Answer: B
Context: Stepfamilies are commonplace in the United States and their number continues to grow.While stepfamilies differ widely in their make-up, they all consist of a parenting couple and children, one or more of whom is of a previous union.Such combinations of his kids, her kids, and then, possibly, kids of the new union make for complicated and often trying difficulties, more challenging than those of traditional families.
Since stepfamilies involve more people and, consequently, more potential problems from the start than do childless new marriage, it is wise for the couple to do some careful planning prior to (=before) marriage.Not only do the prospective  marital partners need agreement about their own carriers, life goals, finance and special interests, they must also prepare for new relationship with their children and attempt to accommodate their individual needs and feelings.Furthermore, there are often the rights of other relatives to consider.
As for any family, the basic ingredient  of a successful stepfamily are affection, kindness and mutual  respect.However, love alone is not enough.Certainly love is the cornerstone upon which the foundation of any family is built, but there are also many other important ingredients involved in building a successful stepfamily.
Surveys reveal that successful families regard the ability to communicate openly as the most important factor in their success.Communication is what keeps families on track and functioning as a unit.Although healthy communication is easier for some people than for others, this skill can be learned and improved.Healthy communication involves speaking clearly and listening carefully.
By their very nature, stepfamilies often are complicated by past events that give rise to ambivalent  loyalties, lingering  hurts, fears,feelings of guilt and unrealistic dreams.The difficulties that arise within the stepfamilies are human and understandable.However, there are ways to confront  and resolve them.For example, support groups and professional counselors  are available in most communities to provide help and guidance when communications stopped and problems seem overwhelming .
Planning and building a stepfamily is not a responsibility to take lightly.It can be a very trying and, at times, seemingly impossible effort.Many potential troubles can arise and threaten to destroy the stepfamily.Nevertheless, meeting and mastering these special challenges can bring unexpected satisfactions and rewarding depths of family closeness and affection. 
 Question:It is natural for a stepfamily to be     . 
A. unrealistic 
B. complicated 
C. ambivalent 
D. guilty 
 Answer: B
Context: When couples get married, they usually plan to have children. Sometimes, however, a couple can not have a child of their own. In this case, they may decide to adopt  a child. In fact, adoption is very common today. There are about 60 thousand adoptions each year in the United States alone. Some people prefer to adopt _ , others adopt older children, some couples adopt children from their own countries, and others adopt children from foreign countries. In any case, they all adopt children for the same reason ---- they care about children and want to give their adopted child a happy life.
Most adopted children know that they are adopted. Psychologists  and child-care experts generally think this is a good idea. However, many adopted children or adoptees have very little information about their biological parents. As a matter of fact, it is often very difficult for adoptees to find out about their birth parents because the birth records of most adoptees are usually sealed. The information is secret so no one can see it. Naturally, adopted children have different feelings about their birth parents. Many adoptees want to search for them, but others do not. The decision to search for birth parents is a difficult one to make. Most adoptees have mixed feelings about finding their biological parents. Even though adoptees do not know about their natural parents, they do know that their adopted parents want them, love them and will care for them. 
 Question:What can we infer from the passage? 
A. Early adoption makes for closer parent-child relationship. 
B. Most people prefer to adopt children from overseas. 
C. Understanding is the key to successful adoption. 
D. Adoption has much to do with love. 
 Answer: D
Context: Most people are aware of what the adoption process is because it has become rather common in our society. Adoption is where a child is legally placed with guardians   or parents (or perhaps a single parent) other than the birth mother or father. Once an adoption is finalized, all parental rights are turned over to the adoptive parents and there is no legal difference between adoptive parents and natural birth parents. There are generally two types of adoption, which are closed adoption and open adoption.
When an adopted person has access to his or her adoption file and original records, it is referred to as an open adoption. The term is also used to describe any contact that may be between the adoptive family, the birth parents, and the adopted child. The level of openness can change greatly in such contact depending on each individual relationship. There can be indirect contact between the natural birth parents and the child through the form of letters and photographs, or there can be actual physical contact.
A semi-open adoption is where the birth parents may have contact with the adoptive parents before the birth of the child, either once or several times. After the birth there is no more contact. A semi-open adoption may remain as it is or it can become either open or closed.
A closed adoption is where only the medical and historical information about the biological parents is given to the adoptive family. Typically, the birth and adoptive parents do not know each other's identities. The record of the birth parents is kept sealed  . A closed adoption is usually only effective in the adoption of babies. The adoption of an older child who already knows his or her birth parents cannot be kept closed. 
 Question:From the passage, we know adoption is   _  . 
A. where a child is brought up by the government 
B. where a child is legally sent abroad by the birth parents 
C. where a child is legally placed with adoptive parents 
D. where a child is sent to live with the children whose parents have died

Context: Our listener question this week comes from Abdullahi Farah, who wants to know about the life and work of Doctor Benjamin Carson.
Doctor Carson is an internationally recognized doctor at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. He has been the director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at the hospital for twenty-five years. At the age of thirty-three, he became one of the youngest doctors in the United States to hold that position. And he was the first African-American to have that position at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
Ben Carson is known for his work as a brain surgeon for children. For example, in nineteen eighty-seven, he led a team of seventy doctors and nurses in an operation to separate two babies joined at the head. Earlier attempts by other
on other babies had failed. Doctor Carson successfully performed the operation. Both babies were able to survive independently.
Doctor Carson has written four books. His first book, ""Gifted Hands,"" tells the story of his life. Benjamin Carson was born in nineteen fifty-one in Detroit, Michigan.
As a boy, Ben was not a good student. In fact, he was the worst in his class. When his mother learned of his failing grades she asked her sons to read two library books every week. She limited the amount of time they watched television. And she told them to respect every person.
Ben Carson soon became the top student in his class. He went on to study at Yale University, one of the best universities in the country, and later to medical school at the University of Michigan.
Doctor Carson has received many awards and honors. Last year he received the nation's highest civilian honor. Former President George W. Bush presented Benjamin Carson with the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a ceremony at the White House.

Context: To the Editor,
Re Why a Fallen Angel Is a Centerfold (Sunday Review, Nov. 6): I first met Lindsay Lohan in 1997 when she was 11 and I was the casting director   of the film The Parent Trap.  I was struck by her talent, fresh charm and innocence the moment I caught sight of her. She was, and remains, a gifted actress and a good human being.
It is not for me to judge Ms Lohan's choices, or whether fame has been less than kind to her, but I have been greatly saddened by the way the media have chosen, with all gloves off and seemingly going with what could please them, to record her efforts and failures.  She is a sentient   human being, not a thing, not a product, not anything else to be sold.
Charles McGrath makes several attractive points in his news analysis about the public demand which is impossible to satisfy, in a 24/7 news cycle forever changed by the Internet, to gossip about, and give nearly complete access to, celebrity or famous persons' lives. Perhaps people do feel better knowing that wealth and fame do not lead to a perfect life for everyone.  Perhaps we admire famous people only to reject them without any pity or mercy when their behavior disappoints us.
I find it ironic   that Ms Lohan's decision to pose for Playboy for a monetary reward is considered to be morally questionable, while journalists and photographers gain profit by writing about and capturing images of her and other famous people.
Perhaps when reporting on and reading about famous people who have lost their way, we will remember that those people are also very human people who, like us, make mistakes, endure misfortune and have a chance--in spite of media coverage--to begin a completely new life tomorrow.

Context: When Taylor Swift first came to the attention of the public,she was a 17yearold newcomer who loved singing to her guitar.She seemed far more enthusiastic than skillful.
Four years later,Swift became a multiaward winner.This month,she was crowned ""Woman of the Year"" by Billboard magazine,the youngest singersongwriter ever to receive the honor.""Aged only 21,Taylor has already made a maior impact on music and has been an unbelievable role model for hopeful artists and young women everywhere,"" said Bill Werde,Billboard's director.
 _ Unlike many pop singers,especially those who do not write their own material,Swift has the power of turning her ideas into lyrics that will set people thinking.""Hidden beneath Taylor Swift's notagirl,notyetawoman sweetness is a very skillful songwriting technique,"" wrote Leah Greenblatt in an American magazine.
Songwriting,as Swift explains,is to cope with issues.""I tend to write about things that really impact me most."" There certainly seems to be something true and honest running through every one of the 14 songs on her album,Speak Now,about ""the lessons and confusion and heartbreak and all the different things that go along with being 18,19 and 20.""
""For the audience too young to have experienced real passion or heartbreak,Swift's songs are like a potential road map,promising things will work out OK,"" commented Dorian ynskey in a British newspaper.
Now Swift is getting ready to go further and has so far written about 10 songs for her 2012 album,which is about feelings of growing up and becoming an adult.""They're sad,if I'm being honest.""""They're about my heartbreaks and my moving on.But more importantly,they are about achieving contentment.You're not always going to be perfectly happy as you grow up."" 
 Question:What is the best title for the passage? 
A. Swift comes to people's attention 
B. Swift rises to fame 
C. Swift wins many awards 
D. Swift experiences real passion

Context: The statistics I've cited and the living examples are all too familiar to you. But what may not be so familiar will be the increasing number of women who are looking actively for advancement of for a new job in your offices. This woman may be equipped with professional skills and perhaps valuable experience. She will not be content to be Executive Assistant to Mr. Seldom Seen of the Assistant Vice President's Girl Friday, who is the only one who comes in on Saturday.
She is the symbol of what I call the Second Wave of Feminism. She is the modern woman who is determined to be.
Her forerunner was the radical feminist who interpreted her trapped position as a female as oppression by the master class of men. Men, she believed, had created a domestic, servile role for women in order that men could have the career and the opportunity to participate in making the great decisions of society. Thus the radical feminist held that women through history had been oppressed and dehumanized, mainly because man chose to exploit his wife and the mother of his children. Sometimes it was deliberate exploitation and sometimes it was the innocence of never looking beneath the pretensions of life.
The radical feminists found strength in banding together. Coming to recognize each other for the first time, they could explore their own identities, realize their own power, and view the male and his system as the common enemy. The first phases of feminism in the last five years often took on this militant, class-warfare tone. Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, Germaine Greer, and many others hammered home their ideas with a persistence that aroused and intrigued many of the brightest and most able women in the country. Consciousness-raising groups allowed women to explore both their identities and their dreams--and the two were often found in direct conflict.
What is the stereotyped role of American women? Marriage. A son. Two daughters. Breakfast. Ironing. Lunch. Bowling, maybe a garden club of for the very daring, non-credit courses in ceramics. Perhaps an occasional cocktail party. Dinner. Football or baseball on TV. Each day the same. Never any growth in expectations--unless it is growth because the husband has succeeded. The inevitable question: ""Is that all there is to life?""
The rapid growth of many feminist organizations attests to the fact that these radical feminists had touched some vital nerves. The magazine ""Ms."" was born in the year of the death of the magazine ""Life."" But too often the consciousness-raising sessions became ends in themselves. Too often sexism reversed itself and man-hating was encouraged. Many had been with the male chauvinist.
It is not difficult, therefore, to detect a trend toward moderation. Consciousness-raising increasingly is regarded as a means to independence and fulfillment, rather than a ceremony of fulfillment itself. Genuine independence can be realized through competence, through finding a career, through the use of education. Remember that for many decades the education of women was not supposed to be useful. 
 Question:What does the word ""militant"" mean? 
A. Aggressive. 
B. Ambitions. 
C. Progressive. 
D. Independent. 
 Answer: A
Context: Pride and Prejudice for the Modern Woman
Let us imagine how Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen's most famous work, might be updated, 200 years on.
Austen's popularity is rooted in her intelligence. But today she would certainly have had a very different life, as would her characters. Here's my own suggestion. . .
It is a truth finally and universally acknowledged that a single woman with brains deserves to have equal opportunities to men, however disadvantaged she may feel by sexism.
"" My dear husband,"" said his hopeful wife one day, "" have you heard that the local store, standing empty for so long, is taken over by a bright young businesswoman?""
Her dull and indifferent   husband replied that he had not. ""But it is, it is,"" she replied excitedly. Mr Dull-Husband made no reply.
""Don't you want to know her plans?"" she cried with some impatience.
""Well, clearly you think it matters to your silly little head. .. so I'd better listen. ""
""Well, my dear, the rumour   is that she has already set up a string of successful businesses in northern England, though _ She will move in herself next month. "" ""What is her name?"" ""Bingley. ""
""Is she married or single?""
""What a question! And none of your business. But her coming will be a fine thing for our five boys. "" ""How so? How can it possibly affect them? ""
""My dear love; those lazy boys need something to wake them up. There are bound to be jobs going. ""
"" Is that her point in settling here? Surely as a woman she has simply taken a fancy to the place. ""
"" Nonsense, my love, how little you've noticed the world has changed. She's got a first-rate degree and some sort of business qualification, I'm told. She surely needs one of our boys! Perhaps you might give her a call. ""
"" Me? No. Perhaps you can take an interest. You still have your looks, after all. She may even offer you a job. "" ""Oh, that's not likely. These new chances belong to the younger generation. But now you mention it, I think I'll go along all the same. ""
And Mrs Bennet went along. That was 10 years ago. She is now managing director of a FTSE-listed company.
... It would remain the case, of course, that Mrs Bennet would be one of very few women on the company board, that her salary would be lower than her male colleagues, her bonus of a more ""female"" dimension and her lifespan   among the city's business leaders shorter than theirs. Still, she'd no doubt have enjoyed Davos--and might even have hobnobbed   with influential figures. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? 
A. Austen was born 200 years ago. 
B. Austen rewrote Pride and Prejudice. 
C. Austen's success lies in her wisdom. 
D. Austen's updated work gains popularity.

Context: After I made it to the city center, I started to feel it might be easy for a foreigner to deal with the great size of Beijing. With growing confidence, I decided to take the subway to the hotel, not realizing that the network didn't go that far. Impressed with the cleanliness of the station, I bought a ticket and boarded the first train that came along.
After a few minutes I asked in English of course a young man seated next to me where I should get off closest to the Friendship Hotel. Wearing a smart business suit and tie, he would surely speak English, wouldn't he? Unfortunately, he couldn't understand me but seemed very friendly. I showed him the room card with all the information of the Friendship Hotel in Chinese characters. He looked at it, and then his eyes moved quickly to the carriage   subway map. Next, he raised three fingers of his right hand.
In Australia, raising fingers at someone is not usually nice, but this man wasn't smiling. At the next station he showed me two fingers. Now in   Australia, that's really rude, but I got the message. When we stopped at the third station, he didn't just point to the door, but got up, took me out of the train, and led me to the top of the stairs, and out onto the street. Then he stopped a taxi and told the driver where to take me.
All this came from a man who couldn't speak my language, and I couldn't speak his. I was now speechless, especially when he refused my offer of money. I felt a little embarrassed having even thought he would accept a tip.
This experience made it clear I had to learn some Chinese quickly or my adventures might start turning into bad luck.

Context: My conscience was pricked again on a tour of Venice in 2010. I had taken refuge  from the crowds in a quiet canal-side cafe. Outside the cafe was an old woman kneeling on the ancient cobbled stones, begging. Steady streams of tourists were walking past her. A lone young back-packer stood away from the throng drinking something, but I noticed he was also observing the woman.
A tourist group glanced at the woman and walked on. Another group of tourists arrived and, again, walked past her. The backpacker watched. Then, as I prepared to leave, I stopped at the sight of the backpacker stepping forward and placing some money in the woman's cup. He did this rather ostentatiously , just before the arrival of another tourist group. I watched as the leader of the group stopped and put some money in the cup. Having been shown the way, other tourists followed suit and added more coins to the woman's cup.
The young backpacker repeated this process in front of the next tour party going past. Once again, the subtle peer  pressure worked on the tourists, who all added coins to the cup. His work done, the young man walked over to the old beggar woman, patted her shoulder and said, ""I hope that helps a bit.""
I don't know if the woman understood his English or realized what had just happened, but I did. I placed some money in the woman's cup and continued my travels, light-hearted after witnessing such an astute act of caring. 
 Question:We can infer from the passage that   _  . 
A. people can do kind acts due to peer pressure 
B. people usually have pity on an old beggar

Context: Jane was running late. Jane, 25, had a lot to do at work, plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Jane felt weak and tired---maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks.
Several yards away, Tom, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying.
But when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, ""Oh, my God, she fell in!"" Tom didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. ""No! Not you!"" his girlfriend screamed after him.
She was right to be alarmed. By the time Tom reached Jane, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station.
It was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the grins and drag her away from the edge. That was where Jane briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse.
Jane thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in.
Police and fire officials soon arrived, and Tom told the story to an officer. Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40-minute train ride downtown-just as he had been seconds after the rescue, which made her think about her reaction at the time. ""I saw the train coming and I was thinking he was going to die,"" she explained. 
 Question:Why did Jennifer try to stop her boyfriend? 
A. Because they would miss their train. 
B. Because he didn't see the train coming. 
C. Because she was sure Jane was hard to lift. 
D. Because she was afraid the train would kill him.

Context: When it comes to President Obama, most of his personal business is already known by the public. Personal information about his children, Malia and Sasha, however, has been kept a little more _ .
The New York Timesrecently released a list of rules that Michelle Obama has mentioned over the years that Malia and Sasha must follow during their time in the White House, as well as in general. See how the first family educates their children:
The girls must write reports about what they've seen on their trips, even if it's not required by their school.
Malia may use her cell phone only on the weekends, and she and her sister cannot watch television or use a computer for anything but homework during the week.
Malia and Sasha have to play two sports: one they choose and one selected by their mother.
Malia must learn todo laundry  before she leaves for college.
The girls have to eat their vegetables, and if they say they are not hungry, they cannot ask for cookies or chips later.
While these might be shocking to some, Michelle said, ""They're not little princess. It's just basic rules, boundaries, and expectations that we would have normally.""
Michelle also mentions another set of rules:
The girls must do their chores , though the White House has a large staff. Malia and Sasha have chores of their own.
They must play a team sport, because it's about learning how to play on a team, how to lose and how to win gracefully.
...
It sounds like Michelle and Barack want the best for their kids and to make them as well-rounded as possible. What are your thoughts on the Obama family rules?

A. The first family daily life. 
B. The first family rules. 
C. How to be good parents. 
D. How to be good students.

Context: Goals can help you do, be and experience everything you want in life. Instead of just letting life happen to you, goals allow you to make your life happen.
Successful and happy people have an idea of how their life should be and they set lots of goals to help them succeed. By setting goals you are taking control of your life. It's like having a map to show you where you want to go. Think of it this way. There are two drivers. One has a destination in mind which is laid out for her on a map. She can drive straight there without any wasted time or wrong turns. The other driver has no goal or destination or map. She starts off at the same time from the same place as the first driver, but she drives without an aim around, never getting anywhere, just using up gas and oil. Which driver do you want to be?
Winners in life set goals and follow through on them. Winners decide what they want in life and then get there by making plans and setting goals. Unsuccessful people just let life happen by accident. Goals aren't difficult to set--and they aren't difficult to reach. It's up to you to find out what your goals and ideals really are.
Research tells us that when we write a goal down, we are more likely to achieve. Written goals can be reviewed regularly,and have more power. Like a contract with yourself, they are harder to neglect or forget. Also when you write your goals in a particular way, you are able to make yourself be continuously alert to situations that will further your goals. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? 
A. Goals can make you gain everything you want in life 
B. Only successful people can be happy 
C. If you want to succeed,you need a set long-term goals instead of short-term Goals 
D. When we put our goal down on papers, we are more likely to succeed

Context: COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A group of black parents and civil rights activists presented a petition  Thursday calling for officials to drop charges against a 16-year-old South Carolina high school student who was videotaped being dragged from her desk and thrown to the floor by a police officer in her classroom.
The group said it was unfair and unacceptable that the student and her 18-year-old classmate at Spring Valley High School who taped the incident were the only people charged that day when authorities already knew Richland County Deputy Ben Fields had tossed the girl from her desk to the ground.
They also said their petition had hundreds of thousands of names from around the country asking prosecutor Dan Johnson to drop the ""disturbing schools"" charges against the teens. The students in the case are black; Fields is white.
Johnson issued a statement Wednesday saying he won't do anything with the case until the FBI finishes its investigation into Fields, who was fired after the video became public. ""I do not simply decide cases based upon feelings, public opinion or sentiment, nor do I decide them based on political pressure,"" Johnson said in the statement.
Disturbing schools is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or 90 days in jail. The students' lawyer did not respond to telephone messages.
The video spread quickly across the country, prompting questions about when police officers should get involved with classroom discipline. Fields was called to the classroom after the student refused to stop using her cellphone, and then she would not leave the classroom for a teacher or administrator.
In the days after the incident, the teacher turned her class over to a substitute and the administrator was placed on leave. Richland two officials didn't respond to an email asking about their current status. The students were allowed back in school.
Organizers of the protest said they plan to be at South Carolina's Statehouse next year, calling for legislators to change the law that allows police officers to arrest students for misbehaving at schools. Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott blamed that law for escalating the situation. ""Let's find a way where we don't saddle students with arrest records,"" said EfiaNwangaza from the Malcom X Center for Self Determination. ""Let's get ahead of the schoolhouse-to-jailhouse train in South Carolina."" 
 Question:What is Don Johnson's attitude towards the case? 
A. Indifferent 
B. Ambiguous 
C. Subjective 
D. Cautious 
 Answer: D

Context: When she was a girl of sixteen and before she began to work in the store , Alice had dated a young man. The young man, named Ned Currie, was older than Alice. He was employed on the local newspaper and for a long time he went to see Alice almost every evening. Together the two walked under the trees through the streets of the town and talked of what they would do with their lives. Alice was then a very pretty girl and one night Ned took her into his arms and kissed her. He became excited and said things he did not intend to say and Alice, betrayed by her desire to have something beautiful come into her narrow life, also grew excited. She also talked. The outer crust of her life , all of her natural shyness and reserve, was torn away and she gave herself over to the emotions of love.
When,late in the fall,Ned went away to Cleveland to try to get a place on a city newspaper and rise in the world , she wanted to go with him.  _ she told him what was in her mind. ""I will work and you can work,she said. ""I don't want to tie you to a needless expense that will stop you making progress. Don't marry me now. We'll get along without that and we can be together. Even though we live in the same house, no one will say anything. In the city we'll be unknown and people will pay no attention to us.""
Ned was puzzled by his sweetheart's determination and was also deeply touched. He had wanted a girlfriend just to relieve the boredom of his life but had changed his mind. He now wanted to protect her and care for her. ""You don't know what you're talking about,he said sharply; ""I'll let you do no such thing. As soon as I get a good job , I'll come back. For the present you'll have to stay here. It's the only thing we can do.
On the evening before he left Winesburg, Ned went to call on Alice. They walked about through the streets for an hour and then went for a drive in the country. The moon came up and they found themselves unable to talk. They stopped at a place where a long meadow ran down to the bank of Wine Creek and there in the dim light he kissed her and promised he would love her forever. When they returned to town, it did not seem to them that anything in the future could blot out  the wonder and beauty of that evening. ''Now we will have to stick to each other; whatever happens, we will have to do that,"" Ned said as he left the girl at her father's door.
He did not succeed in getting a place on a Cleveland newspaper and went west to Chicago. For a time he was lonely and wrote to Alice almost every day. Then he was caught up by the life of the city ;he began to make friends and found  new interests in life. In Chicago he boarded at a house where there were several women. One of them attracted his attention and he forgot Alice in Winesburg. At the end of a year he had stopped writing letters, and only once in a long time when he was lonely or when he went into one of the city parks and saw the moon shining on the grass as it had shone that night on the meadow by Wine Creek did he think of her at all. 
 Question:Which of the following words can BEST describe Ned? 
A. Protective 
B. Changeable 
C. Greedy 
D. Faithful

Context: It was something she had dreamed of since she was five. Finally, after years of training and intensive workouts, Deborah Duffey was going to compete in her first high school basketball game. The goals of becoming an outstanding player and playing college ball were never far from Deborah's mind.
The game was against Mills High School. With 1 minute and 42 seconds left in the game, Deborah's team led by one point. A player of Mills had possession of the ball,and Deborah ran to guard against her. As Deborah was running to block the player, her knee went out and she fell down on the court in burning pain. Just like that, Deborah's season was over.
After suffering the bad injury, Deborah found that, for the first time in her life, she was in a situation beyond her control. Game after game, she could do nothing but sit on the sidelines watching others play the game that she loved so much.
Injuries limited Deborah's time on the court as she hurt her knees three more times in the next five years. She had to spend countless hours in a physical clinic to receive treatment. Her frequent visits there gave her a passion and respect for the profession.  And Deborah began to see a new light in her life.
Currently as a senior in college, Deborah focuses on getting a degree in physical treatment. After she graduates, Deborah plans to use her knowledge to educate people how to best take care of their bodies and cope with the feelings of hopelessness that she remembers so well.

Context: Linda was kind of late. Linda, 25, had a lot to do at work, plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Linda felt weak and tired -- maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks.
Several yards away, Frank, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying.
But when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, ""Oh, my God, she fell in!""Frank didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. ""No ! Not you ! ""his girlfriend screamed after him.
She was right to be alarmed. By the time Frank reached Linda, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station.
It was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the arms and drag her away from the edge. That was where Linda briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse.
Linda thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in.
Police and fire officials soon arrived, and Frank told the story to an officer. Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40minute train ride downtown--just as he had been seconds after the rescue, which made her think about her reaction at the time. ""I saw the train coming and I was thinking he was going to die, "" she explained. 
 Question:How did Frank save Linda? 
A. By helping her rise to her feet. 
B. By lifting her to the platform. 
C. By pulling her along the ground. 
D. By dragging her away from the edge.

Context: On a cold evening I was waiting for a taxi in New York. About 5 minutes later, I was picked up by a driver, and he said how terrible some people were. I knew there was a part of me that wanted to be silent, but I had to listen out of kindness.
The man told me that he had just come from JFK Airport without a customer. During the taxi ride, what started as anger changed slowly and he mentioned that he had read an article which said that the happiest people are the ones that give, so he hoped he'd have more chance to give in his life. I was really starting to enjoy being with this man.
As we arrived at the place where I wanted to go, I paid my money by credit card. I pulled out an extra $20 and said, ""Sir, since we've been talking about giving this whole time, I want to share that feeling with you. I've already paid my money, but here's an extra little bit. You can tell the next passenger in this taxi that their ride is a gift from another.""
I thought I was pretty cool at this point, but he turned toward me, tears in his eyes, and said, ""Sir, I have a better idea. You give that $20 to a homeless person around here and I will give the next passenger a free ride myself.
It was a great honor meeting that man and learning the lesson of how everyone gives and adds joy to another with their generosity.

Context: Jack thought himself a basketball fan. He watched quite a lot of American NBA basketball games. Not only did he watch them, he spent much of his free time playing on the court too. Then came the final year of his middle school. All of his regular teammates stopped showing up on the court because they were simply too busy preparing for the high school entrance exam to play. He was, of course, under much stress himself, like everyone else. A good exam result meant a good high school; a mediocre score meant a mediocre school. _ . However, he loved basketball so much that he still found time to play, this time with a group of guys who were said to have skipped classes before.
Some of his teachers started worrying about him. They asked his mother to go to school to let her know that Jack was hanging out with problem kids. When his mother returned home that day, she wanted to talk to Jack. Knowing the purpose of her visit to the school, Jack thought his mother would punish him for befriending those bad guys. To his surprise, his mother was not angry with him at all. She wanted to hear her son's side of the story. So Jack told his mother about what he knew of Simon and Peter. Simon's parents were badly ill; Peter's father had lost his job. They both seemed to Jack to be normal kids. Jack's mother thought for a moment, then went on to say that she was OK with her son playing with them and that she and her son should think of ways to help these kids. Soon Jack's mum introduced some part-time jobs to Simon and Peter, which they accepted. She believed in her son and cared about those who were less lucky.
Jack's basketball friends and he have left for different places, but they still keep in touch. He knows Peter is now a manager of a local bank. Simon is currently a freshman at a university. Sadly, it is impossible to get together to play basketball again, but whenever they get on the phone, they talk about it all the time. 
 Question:The main idea of the passage is to  _  . 
A. make friends with problem kids 
B. keep in touch with friends all the time 
C. try to understand children and help problem kids 
D. give up hobbies before the high school entrance exam

Wentworth Girls' School
Beachside
July 20th
Dearest Mom and Dad,
I'm afraid I have some very bad news for you. I have been very naughty and the school principal is very angry with me. She is going to write to you. You must come and take me away from here. She does not want me in the school any longer.
The trouble started last night when I was smoking in bed.  This is against the rules, of course. We are not supposed to smoke at all.
As I was smoking, I heard footsteps coming towards the room. I did not want a teacher to catch me smoking, so I threw the cigarette away.
Unfortunately, the cigarette fell into the waste-paper basket, which caught fire.
There was a curtain near the waste-paper basket which caught fire, too. Soon the whole room was burning.
The principal phoned for the fire department. The school is a long way from the town and by the time the fire department arrived, the whole school was in flames. Many of the girls are in the hospital.
The principal says that the fire was all my fault and you must pay for the damage. She will send you a bill for about a million dollars.
I'm very sorry about this.
Much love,
Sarah

Context: Donald was shaken by thunder on the bed before he could count ""one thousand one"". Then he heard the smoke alarm go off. He went downstairs quickly to investigate. When he opened the door to the basement  , flames exploded out.
Donald fled   back upstairs to call 911 but the phone didn't work. When he tried to go downstairs, he was stopped by a wall of flames. He had to use a towel to cover his mouth. His house was three miles off the main road and so well hidden by trees that Donald knew calling for help would be useless. Actually, he didn't even try to do that.
About one mile away lived Donald's closest neighbor, Jeremie. When he heard some sounds, Jeremie jumped out of bed, holding a phone and a flashlight, and went towards the noise. He dialed 911 the instant he saw the flames. When he came close to the house, Jeremie knew he'd better wait until rescuers came. But he didn't want Donald to die in the fire.

He saw Donald on the second-floor balcony, but there was no way to get to him. Suddenly, he noticed a ladder. He dragged it over to the balcony and pulled Donald down just when the second floor fell down.
Within the year, Donald built a new two-story wood house at the site of the fire. Jeremie and Donald don't run into each other regularly, but Donald knows that if he ever needs help, Jeremie will be there.

Context: At 10 years old, Flynn Mc Garry became sick of the meals his mother cooked for him. So the Los Angeles native took matters into his own hands and started making his own dinners. One of his specialties? Trout with braised leeks .
Now 13, the young chef is being praised as a ""food prodigy "". He will spend his summer apprenticing with some of the best chefs at LA's famous restaurants, MSNBC Nightly New reports.
Mc Garry began making a name for himself in the culinary  world when John Sedlar, owner of the trendy Playa Restaurant, let Mc Garry take over the kitchen for a special nine-course meal. The meal sold out almost instantly.
""Flynn is a very unusual young man, and he's very, very passionate,"" owner John Sedlar told MSNBC.
By usual teenage boy standards, it's true. So strong is his passion for cooking that the young man has turned his bedroom into an experimental kitchen laboratory.
Instead of video game consoles, baseball trophies and movie posters, Mc Garry's room is lined with mixers, pots and pans, cutting boards and a stainless steel worktable. It's where Mc Garry cooks his monthly pop-up dinners, which are served from his family's dining room, a monthly supper club he calls Eureka.
Mc Garry is deft  and confident in the kitchen, with skills he's been practicing since he was a child. What started out as a means of self-preservation from his mom's unsatisfactory cooking has turned into a passion that the teen hopes to develop into a career.
""My goal? Michelin three stars, a restaurant in the top 50 list,"" he told MSNBC. ""Hopefully the top five."" Meanwhile, Mc Garry's 13-year-old resume is already richer and more impressive than most cooks many times his age.
Mc Garry isn't the only talented young prodigy to surprise experts in his field in recent years. At just 17 years old, physicist Taylor Wilson is already teaching graduate-level courses in physics and has built a functioning nuclear reactor. 
 Question:Compared with many adult chefs, Mc Garry   _  . 
A. has the best cooking equipment in his kitchen 
B. is inventive and has many new specialties to his name 
C. has much and impressive cooking experience for his young age 
D. wants to open his own Michelin three-star restaurant

And what if you were able to give them a treat while you were away?"" Martin explained her idea.
Now Martin and her family have set up a company. They've had investments   from businessmen and asked a factory to make the product. They expected to sell 8,000 products by the end of 2015.
Martin is satisfied  with her success. ""A year ago, I never thought that I would be able to start a business, or even having an idea for a business,"" she said. ""I've learned that we are supposed to hold on to your dreams.""

Context: An Outstanding Teacher  
Ben put the white envelope into the mailbox. He felt proud, excited, and happy--and also a little nervous about whether his essay would win.
Ben's local newspaper had advertised a contest inviting students to submit essays in honor of a remarkable teacher. The newspaper would choose the five best essays and print them in the paper. As soon as Ben heard about the contest, he knew he wanted to write about Mrs. Gruen.
Mrs. Gruen was always so friendly and patient, and she always had something encouraging to say to her students. Even more importantly, she knew how to make science interesting and enjoyable. Before being in her class, Ben would have said he was uninterested in science, but now science was his favorite subject.
At first, Ben had struggled with his essay. After he finished his first draft, he asked his older sister, Hannah, to review it. Eventually, after many more revisions, the essay was ready to mail. As Ben stood before the mailbox, he imagined how surprised Mrs. Gruen would be  to open the newspaper and see her name in print. 
When the big day finally came, Ben opened the newspaper and eagerly studied the columns of print for the essay he had written. He did not see his essay anywhere. He turned through all of the pages, but it was not there! Instead, he saw five other essays talking about five other teachers. Ben felt like a balloon that had suddenly lost all its air.
A few days later in science class, Mrs. Gruen asked Ben to stay after class for a few minutes. ""Your sister stopped by yesterday,"" Mrs. Gruen told Ben. ""She brought me the most wonderful gift."" Ben saw that Mrs. Gruen was holding a copy of his essay. ""You have no idea how much it means to me that you enjoy my class and think I'm a good teacher. No reward or honor could ever be greater than this essay,"" said Mrs. Gruen.
""OK,"" Ben said, ""I meant everything I wrote."" Then he stepped into the hallway with his head held high. 
 Question:What did Mrs. Gruen think of Ben's essay? 
A. It built up her reputation. 
B. It was a great honor to her. 
C. It helped Ben make progress. 
D. It deserved to win an award.

 Answer: C
Context: When I was growing up, I was embarrassed to be seen with my father. He was badly crippled  , and when we would walk together, his hand on my arm for balance, people would stare, I would be ashamed of the unwanted attention. If ever noticed or bothered, he never let on.
It was difficult to walk together--and because of that, we didn't say much as we went along. But as we started out, he always said, ""You set the pace. I will try to follow you.""
Our usual walk was to or from the subway, which was how he got to work. He went to work sick, and even in bad weather. He almost never missed a day, and would make it to the office even if others could not. It was a matter of pride for him.
When snow or ice was on the ground, it was impossible for him to walk, even with help... Such times my sister or I would pull him through the streets of Brooklyn, N.Y., on a child's sleigh to the subway entrance. Once there, he would try to grasp handrail until he reached the lower steps that the warmer tunnel air kept ice free. In Manhattan the subway station was the basement of his office building, and he would not have to go outside again until we met him in Brooklyn on his way home. w.w.w.k.s.5.u.c.o.m
When I think of it now, I am surprised at how much courage it must have taken for a grown man to suffer from shame and disability. And I am also surprised at how he did it--without bitterness or complaint.
He never talked about himself as an object of pity, not did he show any envy of the more fortunate or able. What he looked for in others was a ""good heart"", and if he found one, the owner was good enough for him.
Now that I am older, I believe that is a proper standard by which to judge people, even though I still don't know exactly what a ""good heart"" is. But I know the times I don't have one myself.
He has been away for many years now, but I think of him often. I wonder if he sensed my reluctance to be seen with him during our walks. If he did, I am sorry I never told him how sorry I was, how unworthy I was, how I regretted it. I think of him when I complain about my troubles, when I am envious of another's good fortune, when I don't have a ""good heart"". 
 Question:How did the father get to work usually? 
A. By subway. 
B. By bus. 
C. By wheelchair. 
D. By bike

Context: Life is filled with challenges. As we get older, we come to realize that those challenges are the very things that shape us and make us who we are. It is the same with the challenges that come with friendship. When we are faced with a challenge, we usually have two choices. We can try to beat it off, or we can decide that the thing presenting the challenge isn't worth the trouble and call it quits. Although there are certainly times when calling it quits is the right thing to do, in most cases all that is needed is commitment and communication.
When we are committed to something, it means that no matter how painful or how uncomfortable something is, we will always choose to face it through instead of running away from it. Communication is making a space for discussion and talking about how you feel as opposed to just saying what the other person did wrong. If you can say to a friend, ""I got my feelings hurt"", rather than ""You hurt my feelings"", you are going to be able to solve the problem much faster.
In dealing with many challenges that friendship will bring to you, try to see them for what they are: small hurdles you need to jump or get through on your way through life. Nothing is so big that it is impossible to get over, and hurt only serves to make us stronger. It is all part of growing up, it happens to everyone, and some day you will look back on all of this and say, ""Hard as it was, it made me who I am today. And that is a good thing."" 
 Question:If your friend hurts your feelings, you are advised to   _  . 
A. point out your friend's mistake 
B. calm yourself down 
C. start a proper conversation 
D. run away from it

I'm sorry that I hurt you so much yesterday. But here is something I really need to tell you. I never thought the quarrel we had yesterday was as serious as you thought.

I don't want to be with you all the time because sometimes I need to have my own time. I want to spend some time with my other friends and my brother. Please try to make more friends. You will feel much happier if you have more friends. And remember,I'm your best friend forever!

Context: An Outstanding Teacher  
Ben put the white envelope into the mailbox. He felt proud, excited, and happy--and also a little nervous about whether his essay would win.
Ben's local newspaper had advertised a contest inviting students to submit essays in honor of a remarkable teacher. The newspaper would choose the five best essays and print them in the paper. As soon as Ben heard about the contest, he knew he wanted to write about Mrs. Gruen.
Mrs. Gruen was always so friendly and patient, and she always had something encouraging to say to her students. Even more importantly, she knew how to make science interesting and enjoyable. Before being in her class, Ben would have said he was uninterested in science, but now science was his favorite subject.
At first, Ben had struggled with his essay. After he finished his first draft, he asked his older sister, Hannah, to review it. Eventually, after many more revisions, the essay was ready to mail. As Ben stood before the mailbox, he imagined how surprised Mrs. Gruen would be  to open the newspaper and see her name in print. 
When the big day finally came, Ben opened the newspaper and eagerly studied the columns of print for the essay he had written. He did not see his essay anywhere. He turned through all of the pages, but it was not there! Instead, he saw five other essays talking about five other teachers. Ben felt like a balloon that had suddenly lost all its air.
A few days later in science class, Mrs. Gruen asked Ben to stay after class for a few minutes. ""Your sister stopped by yesterday,"" Mrs. Gruen told Ben. ""She brought me the most wonderful gift."" Ben saw that Mrs. Gruen was holding a copy of his essay. ""You have no idea how much it means to me that you enjoy my class and think I'm a good teacher. No reward or honor could ever be greater than this essay,"" said Mrs. Gruen.
""OK,"" Ben said, ""I meant everything I wrote."" Then he stepped into the hallway with his head held high. 
 Question:What did Mrs. Gruen think of Ben's essay? 
A. It built up her reputation. 
B. It was a great honor to her. 
C. It helped Ben make progress. 
D. It deserved to win an award.

Context: A story happened when the telegraph was the fastest method of long-distance communication. One day, a young man went to an interview for a job as a Morse code operator .
Answering the ad in the newspaper, he went to the office address. When he arrived, he walked into a large, busy office filled with noise, including the sound of the telegraph. An office worker asked him to wait until he was called to go into the inner office. Seven other people were already in the waiting area for the interview. The young man sat down and waited with them. After a few minutes, the young man stood up, crossed the room to the door of the inner office, and walked right in. Naturally the other people wondered what was going on. They were sure that the young man made a mistake and would be refused.
A few minutes later, however, the boss came out of the inner office with the young man and said to the other people,""Gentlemen,thank you very much for coming, but the young man has got the job.""
The other people were surprised, and one of them said, ""Wait a minute. I don't understand. He was the last to come in, and we never even got a chance to be interviewed. Yet he got the job. That's not fair!""
The boss said, ""I'm sorry, but all the time you've been sitting here, the telegraph has been sending out the following message in Mores code: 'If you understand this message, then come right in. The job is yours.' None of you heard it or understood it. This young man did. The job is this."" 
 Question:How many people went fot the job interview that day? 
A. 7 
B. 8 
C. 9 
D. 10 
 Answer: B
Context: A full stop is used at the end of an idea or thought, and is an important rule in proper grammar. But text messages are changing the rules, as a new study finds digital messages ending with one aren't sincere. The results suggest skipping punctuation altogether, as it indicates you are answering naturally and heartfelt.
Binghamton University's Harpur College observed 126 students, who read a series of messages displayed as texts on a screen or handwritten notes on loose-leaf paper . In the 16 experimental exchanges, the sender's message contained a statement followed by an invitation phrased as a question such as, ""Dave gave me his extra ticket. Wanna come?"" The receiver then gave a one-word response like ""Okay"", ""Sure"", ""Yeah"" or ""Yup"". Half of the participants' responses were with a full stop and the other half did not use it. Based on the responses, text messages that ended with a full stop were rated less sincere than those that did not end with one. The students who read the notes on the paper reported that full stop or not, they felt the message was sincere. These results suggest that punctuation can misconstrue or influence the meaning of text messages. The study concludes, "" _ ""
""Texting is lacking many of the social cues used in actual face-to-face conversations"", said Celia Klin, associate professor of psychology at Binghamton University's Harpur College. ""When speaking, people easily convey social and emotional information with eye gaze, facial expressions, tone of voice, pauses, and so on. People obviously can't use these mechanisms when they are texting. Thus, it makes sense that texters rely on what they have available to them -- emoticons, deliberate misspellings that mimic speech sounds  and, according to our data, punctuation. ""
Recently, Klin's team conducted a follow-up study and found that text response with an exclamation mark  is interpreted as more sincere. ""That's not surprising, but it broadens our claim,""saidKlin. ""Punctuation is used and understood by texters to convey emotions and other social and practical information. Given that people are wonderfully good at communicating complex information in conversations, it's not surprising that as texting evolves, people are finding ways to convey the same types of information in their texts. "" 
 Question:Compared with face-to-face conversations, which of the following can text messages rely on to convey their meaning? 
A. Eye contact 
B. Tone of voice 
C. Emoticons 
D. Gestures

Context: One evening after dinner, Mr. and Mrs. Tisich called a family meeting. ""We've had to make a difficult decision,"" Mr. Tisich announced. ""You see, your mother has been offered a post as co-director of a television station in Chicago. Unfortunately, the station is not here. After thinking long and hard about it, we've concluded that the right decision is to move to Chicago."" Marc looked shocked, while his sister Rachel breathlessly started asking when they'd be moving. ""It's surprising, but exciting!"" she said. Marc simply said, ""We can't go--I can't leave all my friends. I'd rather stay here and live with Tommy Lyons!""
The Tisichs hoped that by the time they moved in August, Marc would grow more used to the idea of leaving. However, he showed no signs of accepting the news, refusing to pack his belongings. When the morning of the move arrived, Marc was nowhere to be found. His parents called Tommy Lyon's house, but Mrs. Lyons said she hadn't seen Marc. Mrs. Tisich became increasingly concerned, while her husband felt angry with their son for behaving so irresponsibly.
What they didn't know was that Marc had started walking over to Tommy's house, with a faint idea of hiding in Lyons's attic  for a few days. But something happened on the way as Marc walked past all the familiar landscape of the neighborhood: the fence that he and his mother painted, the tree that he and his sister used to climb, the park where he and his father often took evening walks together. How much would these mean without his family, who make them special in the first place? Marc didn't take the time to answer that question but instead hurried back to his house, wondering if there were any moving cartons the right size to hold his record collection. 
 Question:The reason for Marc's going home was that  _  . 
A. he did not want to be left behind 
B. he realized his family was important to him 
C. he hoped to reach an agreement with his parents 
D. he wished to be a more responsible person

 Answer: D
Context: A young man learns what's most important in life from the guy next door. It had been some time since Jack had seen the old man. College, girls, career, and life itself got in the way. In fact, Jack moved clear across the country in pursuit of his dreams. There, in the rush of his busy life, Jack had little time to think about the past and often no time to spend with his wife and son. He was working on his future, and nothing could stop him. 
Over the phone, his mother told him, ""Mr. Belser died last night. The funeral is Wednesday."" Memories flashed through his mind like an old newsreel as he sat quietly remembering his childhood days. 
""Jack, did you hear me?""
""Oh, sorry, Mom. Yes, I heard you. It's been so long since I thought of him. I'm sorry, but I honestly thought he died years ago,"" Jack said. 
""Well, he didn't forget you. Every time I saw him he'd ask how you were doing. He'd reminisce about the many days you spent over 'his side of the fence' as he put it,"" Mom told him. 
""I loved that old house he lived in,"" Jack said.
""You know, Jack, after your father died, Mr. Belser stepped in to make sure you had a man's influence in your life,"" she said 
""He's the one who taught me carpentry,"" he said. ""I wouldn't be in this business if it weren't for him. He spent a lot of time teaching me things he thought were important...Mom, I'll be there for the funeral,"" Jack said. 
As busy as he was, he kept his word. Jack caught the next flight to his hometown. Mr Belser's funeral was small and uneventful. He had no children of his own, and most of his  s had passed away. 
The night before he had to return home, Jack and his Mom stopped by to see the old house next door one more time.
Standing in the doorway, Jack paused for a moment. It was like crossing over into another dimension, a leap through space and time. The house was exactly as he remembered. Every step held memories. Every picture, every piece of furniture....Jack stopped suddenly. 
""What's wrong, Jack?"" his Mom asked.
""The box is gone."" he said. 
""What box?"" Mom asked. 
""There was a small gold box that he kept locked on top of his desk. I must have asked him a thousand times what was inside. All he'd ever tell me was 'the thing I value most'."" Jack said. 
It was gone. Everything about the house was exactly how Jack remembered it, except for the box. He figured someone from the Belser family had taken it. 
""Now I'll never know what was so valuable to him."" Jack said.
""I better get some sleep. I have an early flight home, Mom."" 
It had been about two weeks since Mr. Belser died. Returning home from work one day, Jack discovered a note in his mailbox ""Signature required on a package. No one at home. Please stop by the main post office within the next three days."" the note read. 
Early the next day Jack retrieved the package. The small box was old and looked like it had been mailed a hundred years ago. The handwriting was difficult to read, but the return address caught his attention. ""Mr. Harold Belser"" it read. Jack took the box out to his car and ripped open the package. There inside was the gold box and an envelope. Jack's hands shook as he read the note inside. 
""Upon my death, please forward this box and its contents to Jack Bennett. It's the thing I valued most in my life."" A small key was taped to the letter. His heart racing, as tears filling his eyes, Jack carefully unlocked the box. There inside he found a beautiful gold pocket watch. 
Running his fingers slowly over the finely etched casing, he unlatched the cover. Inside he found these words engraved:
""Jack, Thanks for your time! -Harold Belser."" 
""The thing he valued most was...my time""
Jack held the watch for a few minutes, then called his office and cleared his appointments for the next two days. ""Why?"" Janet, his assistant asked. 
""I need some time to spend with my son,"" he said, ""Oh, by the way, Janet, thanks for your time!"" 
 Question:Why did Jack say he needed some time to spend with his son? 
A. He was very tired of his work and wanted to have a good rest. 
B. He had promised to spare more time to stay with his son. 
C. He had missed his son and his family for days. 
D. He came to realize the importance of the time with his family.

She worked hard all day, but just before the exams she was working so hard that her sister was worried about her. She was staying up too late . The night before the first exam, Barbala insisted that she should have an early night and take a sleeping pill. She promised to wake her in the morning.
As she was falling asleep, Kate was worried in case she over-slept. Her mind kept jumping from subject to subject. At last, with the help of the pill, she fell asleep. she was sitting in the examination hall, looking at the paper. She couldn't answer any of the questions.

Context: The girl was hanging by her hands from the railings of a balcony . The balcony was on the twelfth floor of the high-rise block next to his. His flat was on the ninth floor and he had to look up to see her. It was half-past six in the morning. He had been awakened by the sound of an aircraft flying dangerously low overhead, and had got out of bed to look. His sleepy eyes, moved from the blue sky which was empty of cloud, empty of anything but the bright disappearing arrow of the aircraft, and then rested on the hanging figure.
He really thought he must be dreaming, for this sunrise time was the hour for dreams. Then, when he knew he wasn't, he decided it must be a scene in a film. There were cameramen down there, a whole film unit, and all the correct safety precautions had been taken. Probably the girl wasn't even a real girl, but a dummy . He opened the window and looked down. The car park, paved courts, grass spaces between the blocks, all were deserted. On the balcony rail one of the dummy's hands moved, desperately. He had to believe then what was obviously happening. The girl was trying to kill herself. She had lost her courage and now was trying to stay alive. All these thoughts and conclusions of his occupied about thirty seconds. Then he acted. He picked up the phone and dialed the emergency number for the police.
The arrival of the police cars and the rescue of the girl became the focus of talk for the people of the two blocks. Someone found out that it was he who had called the police and he became an unwilling hero. He was a modest, quiet young man, and was in relief when the talk began to die away. Again he was able to enter and leave his flat without being pointed at as a kind of St George and sometimes even congratulated.
About a fortnight after that morning, he was getting ready to go to the theatre, just putting on his overcoat, when the doorbell rang. He didn't recognize the girl who stood outside. He had never seen her face. She said, ""I'm Lydia Simpson. You saved my life. I've come to thank you."" 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that   _  . 
A. the man disliked to be talked about 
B. the girl was unwilling to be rescued 
C. the police arrived quickly on the scene 
D. the girl was actually an actress in a film 
 Answer: A
Context: Jane was running late. Jane, 25, had a lot to do at work, plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Jane felt weak and tired---maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks.
Several yards away, Tom, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying.
But when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, ""Oh, my God, she fell in!"" Tom didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. ""No! Not you!"" his girlfriend screamed after him.
She was right to be alarmed. By the time Tom reached Jane, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station.
It was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the grins and drag her away from the edge. That was where Jane briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse.
Jane thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in.
Police and fire officials soon arrived, and Tom told the story to an officer. Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40-minute train ride downtown-just as he had been seconds after the rescue, which made her think about her reaction at the time. ""I saw the train coming and I was thinking he was going to die,"" she explained. 
 Question:Why did Jennifer try to stop her boyfriend? 
A. Because they would miss their train. 
B. Because he didn't see the train coming. 
C. Because she was sure Jane was hard to lift. 
D. Because she was afraid the train would kill him. 
 Answer: D
Context: She is a cute ,quiet girl. As a daughter, she has no secrets from her mother, who is very pleased with her. But these days she has become not so open as before. She has diary that she keeps under lock and key. Her mother cannot help  worrying about her: what if she falls in love, which is too early for her age. After all, she is reaching the ""dangerous time"". These thoughts have caused trouble in the mother's mind.
One weekend the girl came to tell her mother that she was going to the cinema with her schoolmate and would return late. This was the first time her mother agreed, and she couldn't help worrying because her daughter had never been away at night before. The mother waited till nine. She decided to go out to meet her daughter. Just at that time the noise of a car pulling up drew her to the window and---there was her daughter, waving goodbye to a boy. Her heart missed a beat. When the girl came in, the mother was watching TV, just like nothing had happened. ""Mum, I'm back."" ""Yeah."" ""Sorry to be late. Still sitting up?"" ""Yes. Oh, that ... Who's that boy? "" The daughter fell silent for some time. ""Ah. It's my monitor . He gave me a lift on his way home. Mum, I'm going to bed."" ""All right. Go to sleep early.""
The next morning when the mother went to the daughter's room to do some cleaning, she found her diary left on the bed. After a few minutes' thinking, she at last opened it to the page of the night before. It reads: Mum, It's love that made you ask, but it would show your understanding of me if you hadn't.

Context: My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn't wonderful,but we had everything we needed(beds,blankets,food),and we were pleased to be out of the city and in the fresh air.
On Saturday morning we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron had come along with two friends,Kevin and Simon,while sisters Carole and Lynn had come with Amanda. There were some other members I didn't know. We had come from different places and none of us knew the area.
We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors,but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing and then we changed at lunchtime.

Context: One day, Mary asked her mother, ""Mum, what do people mean by saying they have a skeleton in the closet ?"" Her mother paused thoughtfully and said, ""Well, it's something that you would rather not have anyone else know about. For example, if in the past, someone in Dad's family had been arrested for stealing a horse, it would be a skeleton in his family's closet. He really wouldn't want any neighbor to know about it.""
""Why pick my family?"" Mary's father said with anger. ""Your family history isn't so good, you know. Wasn't your great-great-grandfather a prisoner who was transported to Australia for his crimes?""  ""Yes, but people these days say that you are not a real Australian unless your ancestors arrived as prisoners."" ""Gosh, sorry I asked. I think I understand now."" Mary cut in before things grew worse.
After dinner, the house was quiet. Mary's parents were quite angry with each other. Her mother was ironing clothes and every now and then she glared at her husband, who hid behind his newspaper pretending to read. When she finished, she gathered the freshly pressed clothes in her arms and walked to Mary's closet. Just as she opened the door and reached in to hang a skirt, a bony arm stuck out from the dark depths and a bundle of white bones fell to the floor. Mary's mother sank into a faint , waking only when Mary put a cold, wet cloth on her forehead. She looked up to see the worried faces of her husband and daughter.
""What happened? Where am I?"" she asked. ""You just destroyed the school's skeleton, Mum,"" explained Mary. ""I brought it home to help me with my health project. I meant to tell you, but it seemed that as soon as I mentioned skeletons and closets, it caused a problem between you and Dad."" Mary looked in amazement as her parents began to laugh madly. ""They're crazy,"" she thought. Ks5u

Context: When my son, Mark, was in the third grade, he saved all his pocket money for over three months to buy holiday presents. The third Saturday in December Mark said he had made his list and had twenty dollars in his pocket.
I drove him to a nearby supermarket. Mark picked up a hand basket and went in while I waited and watched in the car. It took Mark over 45 minutes to choose his presents. Finally he came to the checkout counter   and reached into his pocket ... Mark stood there holding his basket, tears falling down his face.
Then a surprising thing happened. A woman came up to Mark and took him in her arms. ""You would help me a lot if you let me pay for you,"" said the woman. ""It would be the most wonderful gift you could give me. I only ask one day you will pass it on. When you grow up, I would like you to find someone you can help. When you help others, I know you will feel as good about it as I do now.""
Mark took the money, dried his tears and ran back to the checkout counter as fast as he could. That year we all enjoyed our gifts almost as much as Mark enjoyed giving them to us.
I would like to say ""thank you"" to that very kind woman, and tell her that four years later, Mark went house to house collecting blankets and clothes for the homeless people in the fire. And I want to promise her that Mark will never forget to keep passing
on.

Context: It's just a small, white envelope stuck among the branches of our Christmas tree. No name, no address. It has peeked through the branches of our tree for the past 10 years.
It all began because my husband Mike hated Christmas. He didn't hate the true meaning of Christmas, but the commercial aspects of it; overspending, running around at the last minute to get a tie for Uncle Harry and powder for Grandma...
Knowing he felt this way, I decided one year to bypass the usual shirts, sweaters, ties and so forth. I reached for something special for Mike. The inspiration came in an unusual way.
Our son Kevin, at 12 that year, was wrestling at the junior level at the school he attended and before Christmas, there was a non-league match against a team sponsored by an inner-city church, mostly black.
As the match began, I was alarmed to see that the other team was wrestling without headgear to protect a wrestler's ears. They obviously could not afford.
Mike shook his head sadly, ""I wish just one of them could have won,"" he said. ""They have a lot of potential, but losing like this could _ .""
Mike loved kids--all kids--and he knew them, having coached little league football, baseball and lacrosse. That's when the idea for his present came.
That afternoon, I went to a local sporting goods store and bought an assortment of wrestling headgear and shoes and sent them anonymously to the inner-city church.
On Christmas Eve, I placed the envelope on the tree, the note inside telling Mike what I had done and that this was his gift from me. His smile was the brightest thing about Christmas that year. For each Christmas, I followed the tradition.
The envelope became the highlight of our Christmas. It was always the last thing opened on Christmas morning and our children, ignoring their new toys, would stand with wide-eyed anticipation as their dad lifted the envelope from the tree to reveal its contents.
The tradition has grown and someday will expand even further with our grandchildren standing around the tree with wide-eyed anticipation watching as their fathers take down the envelope. Mike's spirit, like the Christmas spirit, will always be with us. 
 Question:What can we infer from the passage? 
A. The tradition of sending presents will pass from generation to generation. 
B. The children were eager to get their new toys ignoring the envelope. 
C. With the presents, the poor kids will surely win the match one day. 
D. Mike's spirit, like the Christmas spirit, will always be with us.

Context: It was the summer of 1965. DeLuca, then 17, visited Peter Buck, a family friend. Buck asked DeLuca about his plans for the future. ""I'm going to college, but I need a way to pay for it,"" DeLuca recalls saying. ""Buck said, 'You should open a sandwich shop.'""
That afternoon, they agreed to be partners. And they set a goal: to open 32 stores in ten years. After doing some research, buck wrote a check for $1000. DeLuca rented a storefront   in Connecticut, and when they couldn't cover their start-up costs, Buck kicked in another $1000.
But business didn't go smoothly as they expected. DeLuca says, ""After six months, we were doing poorly, but we didn't know how badly, because we didn't have any financial controls."" All he and Buck knew was that their sales were lower than their costs.
DeLuca was managing the store and going to the University of Bridgeport at the same time. Buck was working at his day job as a nuclear physicist in New York. They'd meet Monday evenings and brainstorm ideas for keeping the business running. ""We convinced ourselves to open a second store. We figured we could tell the public, 'We are so successful, we are opening a second store.'"" And they did--in the spring of 1966. Still, it was a lot of learning by trial and error.
But the partners' learn-as-you-go approach turned out to be their greatest strength. Every Friday, DeLuca would drive around and hand-deliver the checks to pay their suppliers. ""It probably took me two and a half hours and it wasn't necessary, but as a result, the suppliers got to know me very well, and the personal relationships established really helped out,"" DeLuca says.
And having a goal was also important. ""There are so many problems that can get you down. You just have to keep working toward your goal,"" DeLuca adds.
DeLuca ended up founding Subway Sandwich, the multimillion-dollar restaurant chain. 
 Question:What contribute most to their success according to the author? 
A. Learning by trial and error. 
B. Making friends with suppliers. 
C. Finding a good partner. 
D. Opening chain stores.

Context: ""Find a job you love, and you'll never work a day in your life."" Do you agree with this old saying? Joanne Gordon does. She is the author of Be Happy at work and other books about careers . Gordon believes that about 30% of employees  in North America do not like their jobs, and she thinks that is terrible. She wants to help people who do not feel satisfied with their jobs find work that is good for them. Joanne says, ""There are no happy jobs, only happy workers."" She believes that happy workers share three main characteristics.
First, happy workers enjoy the daily activities of their jobs, and they look forward to the workday. Take Tony Hawk, for example. At age 14, he became a professional skateboarder. Now he is a businessman working on projects related to skateboarding--films and video games, but he still skates every day. He once said, ""My youngest son's pre-school was recently asked what their dads do for work. My son said, 'I've never seen my dad do work.'"" Tony agrees that his job doesn't look like work. He has found a way to spend each day doing a job he enjoys.
Second, happy workers like the people they work with. Sally Ayote says, ""I work with the coolest people in the world."" She and her group cook for almost 1,200 people in Antarctica. Most of these people are scientists who are doing research. Sally loves to sit and talk with them. She says, ""There is no television here, no radio, so I get to know the scientists and what they're studying."" Sally thinks she has a great job, and the best part about it is the people.
Third, happy workers know that their work helps others. Caroline Baron's work helps people who have had to leave their home countries because of war or other dangers. She is a filmmaker who started an organization called FilmAid, which shows movies in refugee  camps around the world. Caroline believes that movies can be very helpful in these camps. For one thing, entertaining movies let refugees forget their troubles for a little while. Movies can also teach important subjects like health and safety. For example, in one camp, thousands of refugees saw a movie about how to get clean water. Caroline knows that is helping other people, and this makes her feel proud and happy about her work.
Tony Hawk, Sally Ayote, and Caroline Baron all get great satisfaction from their work. Tony Hawk says, ""Find the thing you love. If you are doing what you love, there is much more happiness there than being rich or famous."" Joanne Gordon would agree. She encourages people to find something they enjoy doing, find people they like to work with, and find ways to help others. Then they can be proud of what they do, and they will probably be happy at work. 
 Question:Who is the book, Be Happy at Work, written for? 
A. Joanne Gordon herself. 
B. Tony Hawk, Sally Ayote, and Caroline Baron. 
C. People who do not feel satisfied with their jobs. 
D. The workers who agree with the author's ideas. 
 Answer: C
Context: Our listener question this week comes from Abdullahi Farah, who wants to know about the life and work of Doctor Benjamin Carson.
Doctor Carson is an internationally recognized doctor at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. He has been the director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at the hospital for twenty-five years. At the age of thirty-three, he became one of the youngest doctors in the United States to hold that position. And he was the first African-American to have that position at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
Ben Carson is known for his work as a brain surgeon for children. For example, in nineteen eighty-seven, he led a team of seventy doctors and nurses in an operation to separate two babies joined at the head. Earlier attempts by other
on other babies had failed. Doctor Carson successfully performed the operation. Both babies were able to survive independently.
Doctor Carson has written four books. His first book, ""Gifted Hands,"" tells the story of his life. Benjamin Carson was born in nineteen fifty-one in Detroit, Michigan.
As a boy, Ben was not a good student. In fact, he was the worst in his class. When his mother learned of his failing grades she asked her sons to read two library books every week. She limited the amount of time they watched television. And she told them to respect every person.
Ben Carson soon became the top student in his class. He went on to study at Yale University, one of the best universities in the country, and later to medical school at the University of Michigan.
Doctor Carson has received many awards and honors. Last year he received the nation's highest civilian honor. Former President George W. Bush presented Benjamin Carson with the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a ceremony at the White House.

Context: Our cat has a sweet nature, and she can let us know what she wants. When we fail to meet her needs, she gently leads us in the proper direction. When I forget to fill her water bowl early in the morning, she runs after my legs, and then pushes me in the direction of her bowl. She doesn't get irritated  ; instead, she expresses her wishes in the best way. And I always understand what she is telling me.
One day I found myself envying   her simple expression. How many times had I expected my husband or my children to know my wants without my ever giving voice to them? How many times had I been disappointed that they couldn't understand when I needed a hug, a compliment   or a chocolate bar?
After a pleasant afternoon with my husband, I wanted to stop somewhere nice and have dinner, but he didn't understand my hints  . ""Couldn't you see that I wanted to go out to dinner?"" I complained when he pulled into our driveway.
""Why didn't you say so? I can't read your mind,"" he answered in impatience. _ . Had I expected him to read my mind? Why hadn't I expressed my desire more clearly? I realized I had fallen into the female trap of ""If you love me, you can read my mind.""
Now, I state my needs clearly and directly. I look at my cat and know she agrees. 
 Question:What will the author do if she wants something from her husband now? 
A. She will give him her hints. 
B. She lets him guess what she wants. 
C. She tells him her needs directly. 
D. She buys what she wants herself.

Context: One evening after dinner, Mr. and Mrs. Tisich called a family meeting. ""We've had to make a difficult decision,"" Mr. Tisich announced. ""You see, your mother has been offered a post as co-director of a television station in Chicago. Unfortunately, the station is not here. After thinking long and hard about it, we've concluded that the right decision is to move to Chicago."" Marc looked shocked, while his sister Rachel breathlessly started asking when they'd be moving. ""It's surprising, but exciting!"" she said. Marc simply said, ""We can't go--I can't leave all my friends. I'd rather stay here and live with Tommy Lyons!""
The Tisichs hoped that by the time they moved in August, Marc would grow more used to the idea of leaving. However, he showed no signs of accepting the news, refusing to pack his belongings. When the morning of the move arrived, Marc was nowhere to be found. His parents called Tommy Lyon's house, but Mrs. Lyons said she hadn't seen Marc. Mrs. Tisich became increasingly concerned, while her husband felt angry with their son for behaving so irresponsibly.
What they didn't know was that Marc had started walking over to Tommy's house, with a faint idea of hiding in Lyons's attic  for a few days. But something happened on the way as Marc walked past all the familiar landscape of the neighborhood: the fence that he and his mother painted, the tree that he and his sister used to climb, the park where he and his father often took evening walks together.

Context: My conscience was pricked again on a tour of Venice in 2010. I had taken refuge  from the crowds in a quiet canal-side cafe. Outside the cafe was an old woman kneeling on the ancient cobbled stones, begging. Steady streams of tourists were walking past her. A lone young back-packer stood away from the throng drinking something, but I noticed he was also observing the woman.
A tourist group glanced at the woman and walked on. Another group of tourists arrived and, again, walked past her. The backpacker watched. Then, as I prepared to leave, I stopped at the sight of the backpacker stepping forward and placing some money in the woman's cup. He did this rather ostentatiously , just before the arrival of another tourist group. I watched as the leader of the group stopped and put some money in the cup. Having been shown the way, other tourists followed suit and added more coins to the woman's cup.
The young backpacker repeated this process in front of the next tour party going past. Once again, the subtle peer  pressure worked on the tourists, who all added coins to the cup. His work done, the young man walked over to the old beggar woman, patted her shoulder and said, ""I hope that helps a bit.""
I don't know if the woman understood his English or realized what had just happened, but I did. I placed some money in the woman's cup and continued my travels, light-hearted after witnessing such an astute act of caring. 
 Question:We can infer from the passage that   _  . 
A. people can do kind acts due to peer pressure 
B. people usually have pity on an old beggar 
C. tourists can be cheated by beggars

Context: Being able to count at least ten people as friends makes us happy, but those with five or fewer are likely to be miserable, researchers say. Their study of hundreds of men and women also found t hat people who feel satisfied with their lives always have lots of close friends and regularly make new ones. While it is not clear whether our friends make us happy or we make friends because we are happy, the researchers say it is clear that we should maintain our friendships. Psychologist RichardTunney said, ""Whatever the reason is, actively working on friendships in the same way as to maintain a marriage is a prerequisite  to happiness. ""Dr. Tunney, of Nottingham University, quizzed more than 1,700 people about their satisfaction  with their lives and the state of their friendships. Those with five friends or fewer had just a 40 percent chance of being happy.  In other words they were more likely to be unhappy than happy. Ten was the first number at which people were more likely to be happy than unhappy. The happiest people were those with dozens of friends, according to the study, which was carried out for the National Lottery .
For women, this meant having 33 friends;for men, the number was 49. Dr. Tunney said,""People who were extremely satisfied with their lives had twice the number of friends of people  who were extremely dissatisfied. "" Women tended to have fewer friends than men but formed tighter relationships. Interestingly, the study found that childhood friends are no more likely to make us happy than people we become close to later in life. Lottery winners, however, have a differentopinion on life. They are always happier than others despite spending their time with asmall circle of old friends. This could be because they trust people they've known for along time. 
 Question:What's the best title for this passage? 
A. The Secret to Happiness Is to Make New Friends 
B. Having at Least 10 Good Friends Makes People Happy 
C. Why Most People Like to Make Friends Regularly 
D. Men's and Women's Friends Are Different 
 Answer: B
Context: Happiness is contagious  , as researchers reported on Thursday.
People with the most social connections -- spouses, friends, neighbors and relatives -- were also the happiest, the data showed. ""Each additional happy person makes you happier,"" Christakis said.
""Imagine that I am connected to you and you are connected to others and others are connected to still others. It is this fabric of humanity, like an American patch quilt.""
Each person sits on a different colored patch. ""Imagine that these patches are happy and unhappy patches. Your happiness depends on what is going on in the patch around you,"" Christakis said.
""It is not just happy people connecting with happy people, which they do. Above and beyond, there is this contagious process going on.""
And happiness is more contagious than unhappiness, they discovered.
""If a social contact is happy, it increases the likelihood that you are happy by 15 percent, "" Fowler said. ""A friend of a friend, or the friend of a spouse or a sibling  , if they are happy, increases your chances by 10 percent,"" he added.
A happy third degree friend -- the friend of a friend of a friend -- increases a person's chances of being happy by 6 percent.
""But every extra unhappy friend increases the likelihood that you'll be unhappy by 7 percent,"" Fowler said.
The finding is interesting and it is useful, too, Fowler said.
""Among other benefits, happiness has been shown to have an important effect on reduced mortality  , pain reduction, and improved cardiac   function. So better understanding of how happiness spreads can help us learn how to develop a healthier society,"" he said.
The study also fits in with other data suggested in 1984 that having $ 5,000 extra increased a person's chances of becoming happier by about 2 percent.
""A happy friend is worth about $ 20,000,"" Christakis said. 
 Question:Which of the following will increase your chances of becoming happier most? 
A. Being in a party with a happy atmosphere. 
B. A happy experience of your brother or your parents. 
C. A happy trip to a foreign country of your friends. 
D. Happiness of your friend's friend. 
 Answer: A
Context: Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver, and the other gold.
This song expresses a nice rule: increasing friends. Sometimes things actually work out that way. I've met adults who've said, ""We've been friends since kindergarten!"" A friend who has known you forever is a treasure. But friendships don't always last -- especially for children.
When I was growing up, my family moved about every three years. The advantage of this was that I got to see different parts of the world, and it made my family very close. I also learned to be pretty good at making new friends, and, to keep in touch with old friends, I became a great letter writer. But I always admired those kids who stayed in one place and kept their friends for a long time. I didn't learn that children's friendships can disappear even when no one moves until I was much older, with children of my own.
Sometimes friendships end in quarrels and hurt feelings. But perhaps the most painful end to a friendship is the one-sided rejection -- one friend turns away, or chooses someone else as a close friend, and the other child is left feeling sad and wondering why this thing happened. The end of a friendship is often sad, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. Often the end of one friendship makes more room for other friendships to grow. 
 Question:When his family moved often, the author couldn't  _  . 
A. make friends easily 
B. become a good letter writer 
C. stay with his friends for a long time 
D. see many different places 
 Answer: C
Context: Family relationship, love and friendship are the three most important emotions in the world. Family relationship is the inborn connection, which you can't avoid or choose at will. Love, for a student, is not always within our reach and as for friendship, personally, it's most important. Nowadays, it is common to see friendship in colleges or middle schools. What is difficult is how to deal with personal contacts between different sexes. The key is to know how to tell love from friendship.
The term, friend, covers a much wider range of meanings. It can be a nodding acquaintance, a comrade, a confident  , a partner, a playmate, a brother, etc. Everyone needs friendship. No one can sail the ocean of life single handed. We need help from, and also give help to, others. In the modern age, people attach more importance to relations and connections. Without stars, the night sky won't be so beautiful; without friendship, our life won't be meaningful. With friendship, life is happy and harmonious. So, friendship may be a quiet walk in the park with the one you trust if possible, while love is the company you are always feeling like keeping. And friendship is when someone gazes into your eyes, you feel only care and calm while love is when someone gazes into your eyes, you will not keep calm.
Love is not a word spoken out easily. In a way, love is selfish, while friendship is selfless and extensive. Love is not necessarily to be returned. But friendship needs something in exchange. You can't wish ""let there be love in our hearts"", for love needs enough time to sow, to water and to take good care of and also needs a rosy, calm, relaxed, emotional and private atmosphere. With such heavy feelings of high pressure and nervousness, do you think the schoolyard the proper field for us middle school students to sow our love? 
 Question:In the writer's opinion,   _  . 
A. family relationship can be chosen 
B. love is more important than friendship 
C. friendship is the most important for students 
D. social development is based on friendship

Context: To win an Oscar is an achievement at any age. To do so at 22, as Jennifer
Lawrence has, is just amazing. Recently, the American star won Best Actress at this year's Academy Awards for her role in the film The Silver Linings Playbook. According to Time magazine's Richard Corliss, Lawrence is that rare young actress who ""lends a mature intelligence to any role"".
Though Lawrence has found great success through her big screen work, Lawrence wasn't sure what she really liked doing before the age of 14. She thought she'd go to college and maybe find a career as a doctor or a travel agent.
Lawrence's two brothers were star athletes and one of them was a straight-A student. Unlike them, she suffered through school, never quite finding where she belonged. However, during a trip to New York, Lawrence suddenly realized that she wanted to be an actress. When she was enjoying the beautiful city, a model seeker asked if he could take her picture, and the next day he called her in for an audition  .
""I read the script and it was the first time I had that feeling like I understand this,"" Lawrence said.
""Within 20 minutes, in the cab ride from the hotel room, I decided I didn't
want to be a model. In fact, I wanted to be an actress."" Having appreciated
this young lady's performance, the agency was so impressed with her reading
that they signed her on the spot. But she insisted on finishing high school so

Context: The light from the campfire brightened the darkness, but it could not prevent the damp cold of Dennis's Swamp   creeping into their bones. It was a strange place. Martin and Tom wished that they had not accepted Jack's _ . They liked camping, but not near this swamp.
""So,"" Martin asked as they sat watching the hot coals. ""How did this place get its name?""
""Are you sure you want to hear it ? It's a scary story,"" warned Jack.
""Of course!"" cried out Tom. ""If there were anything to be scared of, you wouldn't have chosen this place!""
""Ok, but don't say I didn't warn you,"" said Jack, and he began this tale.
""Way back in time, a man called Dennis tried to start a farm here. He built that cottage over there to live in. In those days, the area looked quite different ---- it was covered with tall trees and the swamp was a crystal-clear river. After three hard years, Dennis had cleared several fields and planted crops. He was so proud of his success that he refused to listen to advice.
""'You are clearing too much land,' warned one old man. ' The land is a living thing. It will hit back at you if you abuse it. '
""'Silly fool,' said Dennis to himself. 'If I clear more land, I can grow more crops. I'll become wealthier. He's just jealous!'""
""Dennis continued to chop down trees. Small animals that relied on them for food and shelter were destroyed. He was so eager to expand his farm that he did not notice the river flowing slowly towards his door. He did not notice salt seeping to the surface of the land. He did not notice swamp plants choking all the native plants.""
""What happened?"" Martin asked. It was growing colder. He trembled, twisting his body closer to the fire.
""The land hit back ---- just as the old man warned,"" Jack shrugged. ""Dennis disappeared. Old folks around here believe that swamp plants moved up from the river and dragged him underwater. His body was never found.""
""What a stupid story,"" laughed Tom. ""Plants can't ..."" Before he had finished speaking, he screamed and fainted  . The other two boys jumped up with fright, staring at Tom. Suddenly, they burst out laughing. Some green swamp ivy   had covered Tom's face. It was a while before Tom could appreciate the joke. 
 Question:Why did Dennis ignore the warning of the old man? 
A. The old man envied him. 
B. The old man was foolish 
C. He was too busy to listen to others. 
D. He was greedy for more crops.

What did they choose to sell? Some sold newspapers; some chose bottled water; some sold environmentally friendly shopping bags and bamboo baskets.
Huqi's team decided to sell educational books in front of the Children Activity Centre. They thought parents would like to buy books for their children. But unfortunately , they came across urban management officers . The officers asked them to leave. ""We played hide-and-seek with the officers for the whole morning,"" said Hu. ""Finally we gave up and moved to other place.

Context: Topping the class academically was certainly an advantage. For Nigel, studying was a piece of cake. The reward was certainly much bigger compared to the little effort Nigel had made. It all began when he was selected to help the teachers in the computer laboratories. And the peak of his school career came not when he topped the class but when he was selected for the nationwide competition. 
Unlike everyone else, Nigel wanted to join in the contest because he liked playing with the Lego sets  and making something out of them. Nigel spent two months building his robot. It was during the time that Nigel found out about the big prize for the competition as well as a competitive rival , Alicia, from a neighboring school. His early intentions were forgotten. Getting the thousand-dollar prize was more important than anything else. Nigel decided to make friends with Alicia. Unaware of his intentions, she told him all about the robot that she had been building for the competition. He even helped her to put the finishing touches  to her robot. He was glad with the way things had progressed. His robot looked even better than Alicia's and it was able to play a ball with its arm, something Alicia had failed to do. 
On the day of the competition, he saw Alicia. Everything became clear the minute she saw him among the competitors. She stared at him, puzzled at first, then angry and finally a look of helplessness came over her. 
The flashbulbs   of the camera exploded in Nigel's face. The robot had performed actions so unique and different that the specialists' judgments were the same. Nigel was so pleased with himself that he did not even notice the girl standing a few feet away from him. Without her, he would never have won the competition. 
 Question:What is the author's attitude towards Nigel's actions? 
A. Favorable 
B. Critical 
C. Doubtful 
D. Sympathetic

Context: The drug store was closing for the night and Alfred Higgins was about to go home when his new boss approached him.
""Empty your pockets please, Alfred,"" Sam Carr demanded in a firm voice.
Alfred pretended to be shocked but he knew he had been caught. From his coat he withdrew a make-up kit, a lipstick and two tubes of toothpaste.
""I'm disappointed in you, Alfred!"" said the little gray-haired man.
""Sorry, sir. Please forgive me. It's the first time I've ever done such a thing,"" Alfred lied, hoping to gain the old man's sympathy.
Mr Carr's brow furrowed as he reached for the telephone, ""Do you take me for a fool? Let's see what the police have to say. But first I'll call your mother and let her know her son is heading to jail.""
""Do whatever you want,"" Alfred shot back, trying to sound big. But deep down he felt like a child. He imagined his mother rushing in, eyes burning with anger, maybe in tears. Yet he wanted to come quickly before Mr. Carr called the police.
Mr. Carr was surprised when Mrs. Higgins finally arrived . She was very calm, quiet and friendly. ""Is Alfred in trouble?"" she asked.
""He's been stealing from the store,"" the old man coolly replied.
Mrs. Higgins pulled out her hand and touched Mr. Carr's arm with great gentleness as if she knew just how he felt. She spoke as if she did not want to cause him any more trouble. ""What do you want to do, Mr.Carr?""
The woman's calm and gentle manner _ the once-angry store-owner, ""I was going to get a cop. But I don't want to be cruel. Tell your son not to come back here again and I will let it go."" Then he warmly shook Mrs. Higgins' hand.
Mrs. Higgins thanked the old ma for his kindness, then mother and son left. They walked along the street in silence. When they arrived home his mother simply said, ""Go to bed, you fool.""
In his bedroom, Alfred heard his mother in the kitchen. He felt no shame, only pride in his mother's actions. ""She was smooth!"" he thought. He went to the kitchen to tell her how great she was, but was shocked by what he saw.
His mother's face looked frightened, broken. Not the cool, bright face he saw earlier. Her lips moved nervously. She looked very old. There were tears in her eyes.
This picture of his mother made him want to cry. He felt his youth ending. He saw all the troubles he brought her and the deep lines of worry in her grey face. It seemed to him that this was the first time he had ever really seen his mother. 
 Question:What was the mother's attitude towards Alfred? 
A. She felt disappointed with him. 
B. She was strict with him. 
C. She was supportive of him. 
D. She was afraid of him.

 Answer: C
Context: How do you design a pay plan that motivates people to do their best work? A new study by three Harvard researchers suggests a novel answer: Shortly after you hire new workers, give them a raise.
""Previous research has shown that paying people more than they expect may elicit reciprocity  in the form of greater productivity,"" notes Deepak Malhotra, a Harvard business-administration professor who worked on the study. What he and his colleagues found, however, was that the connection between more pay and extra effort depends on presenting the increase ""as a gift--that is, as something you've chosen to do purely as a nice gesture, with no strings attached.""
Malhotra and his team studied 267 people hired by oDesk, a global online network of freelancers, to do a one-time data-entry project for four hours. All of the new hires were people in developing countries, for whom hourly wages of $3 and $4 were higher than what they had been making in previous jobs.
The researchers split the group up into three equal parts. One group was told they would earn $3 an hour. A second group was initially hired at $3 an hour but, before they started working, they got a surprise: The budget for the project had expanded unexpectedly, they were told, and they would now be paid $4 an hour. The third group was offered $4 an hour from the start and given no increase.
Even though the second and third groups were eventually paid the same amount, the second group worked harder and produced more--about 20% more--than either of the other two. People in the second group also showed the most _ , maintaining their focus all the way through the assigned task and performing especially well toward the end of the four hours. Interestingly, the more experienced employees in the high-performing group were the most productive of all, apparently because their previous work experience led them to appreciate the rarity of an unexpected raise.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, Malhotra points out that higher pay, in and of itself, didn't promote productivity: People who made $4 an hour from the beginning worked no harder than those who were hired at $3 and were then paid $3.
To get the most impact from their pay plans, he adds, companies might consider not only what to pay new hires, but when to pay it.
""The key thing is how you present [the reason for an increase],"" he says. Doling out extra money could promote productivity most ""if you make it clear that the pay raise is something you're choosing to do just because you can. Our theory is that people will reciprocate. If you do something nice, they'll do something nice back."" 
 Question:Which of the following is true about the research? 
A. None of the participants earned more than $4 an hour in previous jobs. 
B. 89 of the participants got a $1 wage raise for their high productivity. 
C. It was so important that the budget for it was increased in the process. 
D. Stamina shown in it was positively related to the amount of money paid. 
 Answer: A
Context: John and Bobby joined the same company together just after they completed their university studies the same year. Both of them worked very hard. Several years later, however, the boss promoted  Bobby to manager but John was still a worker. John could not take it, and gave his resignation  to the boss. He complained that the boss did not think much of those who were hard -working, but promoted only those who flattered him.
The boss knew that John had worked very hard for the years. He thought a moment and said, ""Thank you for what you said, but I hope you will do one more thing for our company before you leave""
John agreed. The boss asked him to go and find anyone selling watermelons in the market. John went and returned soon. He said he had found a man selling watermelons. The boss asked how much they cost every kilogram. John shook his head and went back to the seller to ask and returned to tell the boss $1.2 every kilogram.
The boss told John to wait a second, and he called Bobby to come to his office.  He asked Bobby to go and find anyone selling watermelons in the market.

Several years later, however, the boss promoted  Bobby to manager but John was still a worker. John could not take it, and gave his resignation  to the boss. He complained that the boss did not think much of those who were hard -working, but promoted only those who flattered him.
The boss knew that John had worked very hard for the years. He thought a moment and said, ""Thank you for what you said, but I hope you will do one more thing for our company before you leave""
John agreed. The boss asked him to go and find anyone selling watermelons in the market. John went and returned soon. He said he had found a man selling watermelons. The boss asked how much they cost every kilogram. John shook his head and went back to the seller to ask and returned to tell the boss $1.2 every kilogram.

Context: When I asked my daughter which item she would keep; the phone, the car, the cooker, the computer, the TV, or her boyfriend, she said""the phone"". Personally, I could do without the phone entirely, which makes me unusual. Because the telephone is changing our lives more than any other piece of technology.
Point 1 The telephone creates the need to communicate, in the same way that more roads create more traffic. My daughter comes home from school at 4:00 pm and then spends an hour on the phone talking to the very people she has been at school with all day. If the phone did not exist, would she have anything to talk about?
Point 2 The mobile phone means that we are never alone. ""The mobile saved my life,""says Crystal Johnstone. She had an accident in her Volvo on the A45 between Otley and Skipton. Trapped inside, she managed to make the call that brought the ambulance  to her rescue.
Point 3 The mobile removes our secret. It allows marketing manager of Haba Deutsch, Carl Nicolaisen, to ring his sales staff all round the world at and time of day to ask where they are , where they are going, and how their last meeting went.
Point 4 The telephone separates us. Antonella Bramante in Rome says, ""We worked in separate offices but I could see him through the window. It was easy to get his number. We were so near----but we didn't meet for the first two weeks!""
Point 5 The telephone allows us to reach out beyond our own lives. Today we can talk to several complete strangers simultaneously ( ) on chat lines (at least my daughter does. I wouldn't know what to talk about). We can talk across the world. We can even talk to astronauts (if you know any) while they're space-walking. And, with the phone line hooked up to the computer, we can access  the Internet, the biggest library on Earth. 
 Question:Which of the following best shows people's attitude towards mobile phones? 
A. Mobile phones help people deal with the emergency. 
B. Mobile phones bring convenience as well little secret to people. 
C. Mobile phones are so important and should be encouraged. 
D. Mobile phones are part of people's life.

Context: Many television programmes are very realistic. One who watches TV often feels that whatever happened in the film could well happen to him. With only a little imagination, every man in the street becomes a thief, a spy or a murderer. Jane had been watching a spy film at her friend's house. In it, a young girl had been followed and murdered. She felt a little frightened, walking to the station. She took a train back to the centre of the city. There were a lot of people traveling with her, so she felt much safer.
A man sitting opposite her, reading a newspaper, glanced at her. She thought nothing of it until she saw him staring at her. Remember the film and feeling very uncomfortable, she got off the train and went to the bus stop. When he got on the same bus as she did, she found that he was following her. As long as she had been with other people she wasn't frightened. But when she got off the bus, the streets were almost empty. She walked as quickly as she could. She could hear footsteps following her but she didn't dare to look around. After what seemed to have been hours, she was unable to find them, because she was so frightened. The footsteps stopped behind her. She felt a hand on her shoulder. Instead of feeling hands round her neck, however, she heard a pleasant voice. ""I apologize if I frightened you. I'm your new neighbour. I thought I recognized you in the train, but I wasn't sure."" 
 Question:The man put his hand on her shoulder. He meant to   _   Jane. 
A. kill 
B. be friendly to 
C. frighten 
D. play a joke on 
 Answer: B
Context: It was a very foggy day in London. The fog was so thick that it was impossible to see more than a foot or so. Buses, cars and taxis were not able to run and were standing by the side of the road. People were trying to find their way about on foot but were losing their way in the fog. Mr. Smith had a very important meeting at the House of Commons and had to get there but no one could take him. He tried to walk there but found he was quite lost. Suddenly he bumped into a stranger. The stranger asked if he could help him. Mr. Smith said he wanted to get to the Houses of Parliament. The stranger told him he would take him there. Mr. Smith thanked him and they started to walk there. The fog was getting thicker every minute but the stranger had no difficulty in finding the way. He went along one street, turned down another, crossed a square and at last after about half an hour's walk they arrived at the Houses of Parliament. Mr. Smith couldn't understand how the stranger found his way. ""It is wonderful,"" he said. ""How do you find the way in the fog?""
""It is no trouble at all to me,"" said the stranger, ""I am blind."" 
 Question:According to the passage, we can infer that ""bump into"" means   _  . 
A. knock off 
B. meet by chance 
C. strike 
D. traffic accident 
 Answer: B
Context: How much empathy do you feel towards other people? If you saw someone fall off their bike in traffic,would you stop and help--or just walk away? Many people would give in to coldness,go about their business and just do nothing.So it was a big surprise when about  100 bystanders got together recently to move a bus in east London to help a cyclist trapped under it.A video of the incident went viral on social media.
According to Zoheb,a driver who stopped his car to take part in the rescue,about five  people gathered to move the bus.He says:""There was no chance we could do it,it was more  an invitation for other people to help,really.""
The initiative paid off.Diners from nearby restaurants joined in.There wasn't much coordination but it didn't take long to develop a collective understanding of what the  objective was.
Spontaneous cooperation among strangers doesn't happen often.People in a  crowd are not sure what to do--they don't have a plan.It's one of the reasons bystanders often do nothing,according to Dr Mark Levine,professor of social psychology at Exeter University in Britain.""The presence of others can prevent you from helping"",he says.
The key to positive group behaviour,Levine explains,""is building a sense of shared identity"".Action has to be decided quickly,Levine says.""The longer you leave it,the harder it is to make a decision.If you don't immediately act then you kind of think'Well,actually I probably couldn't have done anything anyway'.""
But the people who took the initiative like Zoheb might make a difference.The cyclist ended up in hospital and the images of the collective effort might inspire others to more acts of unity. 
 Question:Why do people give in to coldness when they should be helping according to Levine? 
A. They don't know how to give first aid. 
B. Nobody wants to be the first to offer help. 
C. Strangers seldom cooperate with each other. 
D. They are forbidden from helping. 
 Answer: C
Context: The sun had gone behind a cloud. I was very tired and wanted nothing in the world so much as to be at home. At last I got to the gate of Hide Park. But this was worse than ever; there were buses there--high and terribly red cars, taxis and still more buses in an endless line. Everywhere there were people hurrying past or waiting to get into the buses, while I stood lost in the middle of them.
I was ready to cry. In despair, I crossed the street on to an ""island"", where I found a policeman. I took my last bit of courage in both hands and said, ""Please, sir, where is Addison Road?"" He began to explain, but when he saw that I couldn't understand he became helpless, too. ""Are you French at school?"" A few minutes later, he smiled and raised his hand. How wonderful! The traffic stopped. Even the red buses stood still and waited until I had crossed the road. 
 Question:That  _  is the most probable reason why she was tired out. 
A. it had been very hot by then 
B. the writer had been standing lost for a long time

Context: I used to hate my mother because she worked a lot and didn't spend much time with me. Then one Friday morning I took part in a three-day self-help program for teenagers. Whether you believe it or not, that weekend changed my life.
About 100 other teenagers were there. During the first two days I met a lot of great people. I was glad because I made so many friends there.
On Sunday, the leader did an interesting exercise called ""Chocolate or Toys"". He asked a girl which she liked better, chocolate or toys. She chose chocolate. Then he asked her to choose again between chocolate and chocolate. Of course, she didn't have a choice.
This exercise told us that sometimes we don't have a choice in life, and that sometimes we have to accept something, rather than complaining .
A girl stood up and started talking about her mom who was a drug addict  and how much she hated her mother.
""I want a new mom,"" she cried.
""Unluckily, you can't have one,"" the leader replied.
""You have to accept the mother that you have.""
This hit me hard. I realized that, for better or worse, my mom was my mom. I couldn't choose another mom, but I could try to make the best of the situation.

 Answer: B
Context: Self-control can make you happier not only in the long-run, but also in the moment.
The research showed that self-control isn't about giving up desires, but more about managing conflicting goals. Since most people consider highly self-controlled ones as being more task-centered, the scientists decided to find out the connection between self-control and people's happiness to determine if being self-disciplined leaves people feel less joyful.
Through a set of tests-including one that assessed 414 middle-aged participants on self-control and another that randomly interviewed volunteers on their smart phones about their mood and any desires they might be experiencing, researchers found a strong connection between higher levels of self-control and satisfaction.
The smart phone experiment also showed how self-control may improve mood. Those who showed the greatest self-control reported more good moods and fewer bad ones. But this didn't appear to be linked to being more able to resist temptation --it was because they exposed themselves to fewer situations that might inspire desires in the first place. They were doing a number of things that bring them happiness and avoiding problematic desires and conflicts.
That became clear in the study's last experiment, which looked into how self-control affects the way people handle goals that conflict with one another. In particular, the researchers were interested in how self-disciplined and less-disciplined people differed when it came to choosing among ""virtues"" and ""vices"" like the pleasure of eating sugar cookie vs. the pain of gaining weight. Participants were asked to list three important goal conflicts they experienced regularly and were also questioned on how they managed to balance the goals.
The highly self-controlled showed an obvious difference from those with less discipline over their lives. They tended to avoid creating situations in which their goals would conflict, and reported fewer instances of having to choose between short-term pleasure and long-term pain. As a result, they experienced fewer negative emotions.
And self-control doesn't always mean _ : it may mean saving now to get big payoff later. For dieters, it means making choices to avoid entering a bakery since you are more likely to buy a cupcake. Granted, self-control isn't the best way to instant satisfaction, but it may bring something even better: long-term contentment. 
 Question:Different from the less-controlled ones, the highly self-controlled people  _  . 
A. rarely prefer pleasures 
B. often create conflicting goals 
C. like to put up with pain 
D. stay away from negative emotions

Context: Danger-junkie orangutans  in Borneo climb dead trees and shake then until they begin to fall. They scream with excitement as they cling to the falling tree. Just before the tree hits the ground the orangutans leap to another tree or vine, narrowly escaping death. While no one cab ask orangutans if they enjoy it as a person playing an extreme sport, one animal behaviorist sees this monkey fun as a bit of harmless thrill-seeking.
A growing number of scientists agree that animals are conscious and capable of experiencing basic emotions , such as happiness, sadness, boredom or depression. A few scientists even see the possibility for higher animal emotions like love, jealousy and spite.
Five years ago, behaviorist and animal-rights activist Dr. Jonathan Balcombe stood on a Virginia hotel balcony watching two crows intimately groom   each other in the comfort of an abandoned billboard. He felt that the birds liked what they were doing, even if engaged in a natural, beneficial act, such as picking parasites   off the other's feathers. That moment changed the way he would view animals forever and led to a book, ""Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good"", which is filled with hundreds of examples of animals living it up thanks to developed senses of touch, taste, sight, sound and smell.
Balcombe recounts a favorite example of Kenyan hippos   having high-end spa treatment in a fresh water spring. They splay their toes, open their mouths wide and wait for a school of cleaner fish to remove parasites and slough off dead skin, he recalls. Balcombe knows that the hippos and the fish both benefit from this arrangement. ""My interpretation is that it is also enjoyable for them ,"" he says. 
 Question:We can conclude from the passage that   _  . 
A. only a few animals have emotions 
B. Balcombe's theory is not supported by other scientists 
C. Balcombe has watched a lot of animals showing emotions 
D. Balcombe can understand animal language 
 Answer: C
Context: There is a famous English saying ""You are what you eat"", and _ means what you put in your mouth will become part of you. Many experts   use it to tell people it's important to have a good eating habit. For example, too much sweet food makes a person overweight . To avoid being fat, kids are told to keep off sweet food. But, a team of American scientists have found something new about eating sweet food.
""When we say some people 'sweet', we mean they are kind and friendly to us. Perhaps  this word can help us learn more about people's feelings and acts."" said Brian Meier, a scientist from the study team. ""Taste is something we experience every day. What we have done is to find whether we can know someone's character  and behavior  depending on their taste.""
In one of their experiments ,  students were asked questions about their character-whether, for example, they were soft-hearted or not. Then they were asked to make a list of their favorite food. According to their answers, the scientists found that the students who liked sweet food were nicer.
In their another experiment, the scientists found that people who preferred sweet food such as cookies and chocolate were more willing to help other people in need, and those who ate non-sweet food such as chips weren't. For example, people with a sweet tooth were more likely to volunteer to clean up their city, visit sick children in the hospital and so on.
The result of the experiments is that people's helpfulness or being nice has something to do with their taste for sweet food. So eating sweet food is a useful way to make people nice and helpful. Next time, try some ice-cream.
,. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the followings is NOT true? 
A. There is some relationship between someone's character and their taste. 
B. Kids are told to keep away from sweet food to be fat. 
C. What you put in your mouth will show your character. 
D. If people want to be kind or friendly, they can try some sweet food.

Context: I was born in Minneapolis. The city is in my blood. But I live in the country, and have been forced to deal with things that are difficult. One thing I've always had trouble with is birds. How could anyone enjoy staring out of the window for hours at these creatures? My mother had always been one of those ridiculous birdwatcher types. She tried to raise her children to have respect for wildlife, but with little effect on me.
One evening, a bird had been sitting on the same perch  , as if frozen, for ten minutes. My mother got a ladder and took the bird from his perch. She inspected him. It seemed that his tongue was hurt, and that he was unable to drink from the feeder. My mother handed him to me while she went inside for an eyedropper  .
Never in my life had I felt as frightened as when I was holding that tiny life in my hands. I placed the eyedropper inside the long beak. At first, the bird only trembled, but finally he managed to swallow. After a few minutes, he glided   to a tree nearby and returned again. He flew to the tree and then back to me again and again. It didn't take me long to realize that he was sending me a message, a sort of ""SOS"".
I walked toward the tree, where I found the tiny creature trembling in the evening air. I slowly reached into the grass to pick up the bird. ""Please, be okay."" He had asked me for help. Now he owed me a favor in return and I was asking him to stay alive.
However, what I saw was another dead bird lying besides the bird. It must have been a very sad picture: a child wiping her face with her one free hand, while the other palm was cupped around a tiny, dying creature. Fate was taking its own course. Its pulse was hardly noticeable, and the body was growing colder.
I realized there were some things I could change and some I must simply accept. In either way, the two worlds sometimes collide   and strangers must ask for, and be willing to receive, help from others. Without this, survival is not only impossible, but meaningless. 
 Question:Why did the bird fly to the author again and again? 
A. To thank her for saving him. 
B. To look for food to feed the dying bird. 
C. To warn her of danger. 
D. To ask for help for the dying bird.

Context: Every morning, the newspaper chief editor  holds a meeting with the reporters. They discuss the main events  of the day. Reporters are then sent to cover the events.
As soon as the reporters know what to write about, they get down to work. They telephone people and fix a time for a face-to-face interview with them. Sometimes they do telephone interviews. Checking information is very important. They go to the newspaper's own library to look up any information that they need. This is called ""doing one's homework"".
At the same time, the picture editor decides which photographs will be used for the next day's paper. All the people who work on a newspaper must be able to work fast. Reporters have to stop working on one story and start working at once on the important new one. They must find out the new information as quickly as possible. Later in the day, everything is put together at the news desk. Reporters return, type their stories into the computer and hand them to the editor.
The chief editor decides which will be the most important story on the front page. Sometimes this will have to be changed if something more important happens late in the day. Other editors read the stories which the reporters have written and make any necessary changes.
Finally, there is no more time left for adding new stories, and the time for printing  the newspaper has come. This is done on fast-moving printing machines. The newspapers are then delivered  by truck, plane or rail. Speed is important. People want to buy the latest newspaper; nobody wants to buy yesterday's. 
 Question:The best title for this passage is ""  _  "". 
A. How a newspaper is produced 
B. How newspapers are delivered

Context: Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was one of the most private women in the world, yet when she went to work as an editor in the last two decades of her life, she revealed herself as she did nowhere else.
After the death of her second husband, Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, Jacqueline's close friend and former White House social secretary Letitia Baldrige made a suggestion that she consider a career in publishing. After consideration, Jacqueline accepted it. Perhaps she hoped to find there some idea about how to live her own life. She became not less but more interested in reading. For the last 20 years of her life, Jacqueline worked as a publisher's editor, first at Viking, then at Doubleday, pursuing a late-life career longer than her two marriages combined. During her time in publishing, she was responsible for managing and editing more than 100 successfully marketed books. Among the first books were In the Russian Style and Inventive Paris Clothes. She also succeeded in persuading TV hosts Bill Moyer's and Jose Campbell to transform their popular television conversations into a book, The Power of Myth. The book went on to become an international best-seller. She dealt, too, with Michael Jackson as he prepared his autobiography , Moonwalk.

Her choices, suggestions and widespread social relations were of benefit both to the publishing firms and to Jacqueline herself. In the books she selected for publication, she built on a lifetime of spending time by herself as a reader and left a record of the growth of her mind. Her books are the autobiography she never wrote. _ the end, was overshadowed by her performance as an editor. However, few knew that she had achieved so much.

Context: An Outstanding Teacher  
Ben put the white envelope into the mailbox. He felt proud, excited, and happy--and also a little nervous about whether his essay would win.
Ben's local newspaper had advertised a contest inviting students to submit essays in honor of a remarkable teacher. The newspaper would choose the five best essays and print them in the paper. As soon as Ben heard about the contest, he knew he wanted to write about Mrs. Gruen.
Mrs. Gruen was always so friendly and patient, and she always had something encouraging to say to her students. Even more importantly, she knew how to make science interesting and enjoyable. Before being in her class, Ben would have said he was uninterested in science, but now science was his favorite subject.
At first, Ben had struggled with his essay. After he finished his first draft, he asked his older sister, Hannah, to review it. Eventually, after many more revisions, the essay was ready to mail. As Ben stood before the mailbox, he imagined how surprised Mrs. Gruen would be  to open the newspaper and see her name in print. 
When the big day finally came, Ben opened the newspaper and eagerly studied the columns of print for the essay he had written. He did not see his essay anywhere. He turned through all of the pages, but it was not there! Instead, he saw five other essays talking about five other teachers. Ben felt like a balloon that had suddenly lost all its air.
A few days later in science class, Mrs. Gruen asked Ben to stay after class for a few minutes. ""Your sister stopped by yesterday,"" Mrs. Gruen told Ben. ""She brought me the most wonderful gift."" Ben saw that Mrs. Gruen was holding a copy of his essay. ""You have no idea how much it means to me that you enjoy my class and think I'm a good teacher. No reward or honor could ever be greater than this essay,"" said Mrs. Gruen.
""OK,"" Ben said, ""I meant everything I wrote."" Then he stepped into the hallway with his head held high. 
 Question:What did Mrs. Gruen think of Ben's essay? 
A. It built up her reputation. 
B. It was a great honor to her. 
C. It helped Ben make progress. 
D. It deserved to win an award.

Context: As a group of young African immigrants struggle to adapt to life in the United States, an after-school drama program at White Oak Middle School aims to make their lives easier by first making them a little harder.
Project X is a program that uses drama, dance, poetry and other creative outlets to help students discuss the tough and sometimes painful problems they face as pre-teen immigrants with language barriers. A final unveiling of their creation will be performed for friends and family at the end of the year at Imagination Stage.
Wanjiru Kamau, coordinator of White Oak's African Club said it's important to give troubles to group members to help them find their place at the school. ""It comforts those who are uncomfortable, and it discomforts those who are comfortable,"" Kamau said of Project X.
Kamau teamed up with Imagination Stage after she noticed that many African students seemed uncomfortable talking about problems, such as being laughed at by their fellow students about how they look and talk. When most of the kids join the club, they speak little or no English, Kamau said. Each week, the club typically draws five to ten students who are originally from Africa for discussion sessions and the Project X programme.
""We are going to express ourselves through our words and our actions, and that's powerful,"" said teaching artist Meg Green as she introduced fill-in-the-blank poems the students wrote about their identities.
One student, Frank Ketchouang, 13, wrote, ""I am from the world; I am love,"" which drew oohs and aahs from the group. Ketchouang has been in the United States for less than a year, said Program Coordinator Chad Dike. When Ketchouang started attending Project X, he had been in the United States for two months and spoke no English. Now he's one of the group's most outgoing members and helps translate instructions from English to Creole for the group's newest member, who is from Haiti.
Many people will give up when there's a language barrier, ""but these students prove them wrong"". Kamau said. ""You do have something to give. You are important. When TV, media, etc. are bringing them down, this program is bringing them up."" 
 Question:The passage is written mainly to  _  . 
A. introduce the Project X program 
B. inspire immigrants to never give up 
C. advocate White Oak'S African Club

Context: My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn't wonderful,but we had everything we needed(beds,blankets,food),and we were pleased to be out of the city and in the fresh air.
On Saturday morning we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron had come along with two friends,Kevin and Simon,while sisters Carole and Lynn had come with Amanda. There were some other members I didn't know. We had come from different places and none of us knew the area.
We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors,but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing and then we changed at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves  first. Climbing out was harder than going in,but after a good deal of pushing, we were out at last. Though we were covered with mud,we were pleased and excited by what we'd done.

Context: Few of us act alone in the real world. Most things are done with the help or ideas of other people. Group projects are great practice for high school, college, and real life, when you will probably have a job that requires working with others. Right now, group projects can be fun and they often allow you to do a bigger, more interesting project than you could alone. With group work, you can actually learn more in less time.
Group projects also give you a chance to get to know kids you might not otherwise know or talk with. Group projects are also a great way to practice skills you're not so sure of. For example: working on a deadline, staying organized, or being patient. And if you're a little nervous talking in front of a group, a joint project can help you become more comfortable with it. Maybe your group will pick you to tell the whole class about your project. If so, you'll know your whole group is _ you!
One of the most important things about group work is talking and meeting together. It's a good idea to continually check with everybody on their progress to see if anyone needs help. You might think the first step is to figure out who will do what, but actually it's getting to know another a little. Take a few minutes to chat. Even if you know each other well, it can help to take a minute to think about your skills and share your strengths and weaknesses. The second step is to go over ground rules from your teacher and any that you want to create together as a group. 
 Question:Group projects can give you a chance to do the following EXCEPT   _  . 
A. get to know more friends 
B. learn more than you do alone 
C. work in an organized way 
D. get rid of shyness forever

Context: When John Weston awoke that morning, he remembered that his mother was going into hospital. He hadn't worked out quite what was wrong with her. He knew, though that she hadn't been well for some time now, and it had become almost familiar to him to see her eyes narrowed in a sudden attack of pain, and her hand pressing against her heart. Their own doctor, who she had finally gone to for advice, had sent her to an expert who knew all about these things. He had told her that just as soon as there was a bed for her, she would have to come into his hospital where he could look after her himself.
During the weeks since then the pains had come even more frequently, and the narrowed eyes became an almost permanent part of her expression. Always rather sharp, she began losing her temper over little things so that John's father kept his thoughts to himself more and more. John, as ready as possible to make allowances, tried to think what it would be like to have toothache all the time and how bad-tempered that would make you.
So his mother would go into hospital for a few days. He was going to stay with his Aunt Daisy till she came back, and his father would stay on at home by himself. John's cousin, Mona, was to come in and make the bed and wash the pots and dust round now and again. That was the arrangement, and John didn't care much for it. Apart from missing his mother(and he was glad she was going away because they would make her better), he wasn't very fond of his Aunt Daisy because she was even more bad-tempered than his mother. 
 Question:how did John react to his mother's bad temper? 
A. he tried to imagine himself in her place. 
B. He tried not to notice it. 
C. He pretended that he had toothache. 
D. He behaved himself as well as possible.

Context: I'm not so sure I like my friends any more. I used to like them-to be honest. We'd have lunch, talk on the phone or exchange emails, and they all seemed normal enough. But then came Face Book, and I was introduced to a sad fact: many of my friends have dark sides that they had kept from me.
Today my friends show off the more unpleasant aspects of their personalities via FaceBook. No longer hidden, they're thrown in my face like TV commercials -unavoidable and endless advertisements for the worst of their personalities.
Take Fred. If you were to have lunch with him, you'd find him warm, and self-effacing .Read his FaceBook and you'll realize he's an unbearable, food-obsessed boring man. He'd pause to have a cup of coffee on his way to save a drowning man-and then write about it.
Take Andy. You won't find a smarter CEO anywhere, but now he's a CEO without a company to run. So he plays Mafia Wars on FaceBook. He's doing well-level 731. Thanks to FaceBook, I know he's playing about 18 hours a day. Andy, you've run four companies-and this is how you spend your downtime? What happned to golf?What happened to getting another job?
Take Liz. She is positive that the flu vaccine will kill us all and that we should avoid it. And then comes Chris who likes to post at least 20 times a day on every website he can find, so I get to read his thoughts twice, once on FaceBook and once on Twitter.
In real life, I don't see these sides of people. Face to face, my friends show me their best. They're nice, smart people. But face to FaceBook, my friends is like a blind date which goes horribly wrong.
I'm left with a dilemma. Who is my real friend?Is it the Liz I have lunch with or the anti-vaccine madman on FaceBook? Is it the Fred I can grab a sandwich with or the Fred who weeps if he's at a party and the wine isn't up to his standard? 
 Question:According to the text, FaceBook tends to   _  . 
A. present another side of people 
B. offer some foods for free 
C. show endless advertisements

She doesn't have any pets. I happened to see her outside on a -30 degree morning walking a dog. I felt sorry for Mary, out there walking a dog that's not hers in such cold weather. I thought maybe she was saying to herself, ""Yeah, this is why I don't have any pets! I hate walking dogs.""
Later that day I saw Mary and said, ""I saw you out there walking a dog this morning. Are you unhappy because you had to walk it on such a cold day?"" To my surprise, she said that she enjoyed getting out there and walking the dog and that she got good exercise because of the dog. She also said she had talked to her brother, the dog's owner, who was on holiday in Orlando, Florida with his family. He said his children were enjoying Disney World and the resorts  . His four-year-old son had breakfast with Mickey Mouse and said it was the best day in his life. Mary said, ""If I can help my brother and his family have a wonderful time relaxing for a week, knowing that their pet is being loved and cared for, what more could I ask for?"" She added, ""It's worth it for me to make the sacrifice   so that they can go and have fun.""

Context: When middle-aged Alex quit his job and made up his mind to become a self-employed writer, no one could tell for sure whether he would succeed or not.He found a cold storage room in a building, set up a used typewriter and settled down to work.
After a year or so, however, Alex began to doubt himself.He found it was difficult to earn his living by selling what he wrote.But Alex determined to put his dream to the test--even though it meant living with uncertainty and fear of failure.This is the shadowland   of hope, and anyone with a dream must learn to live there.

After Alex got off the phone, he pulled out everything he had: two cans of vegetables and 18 cents.Alex put the cans and cents into a paper bag, saying to himself,"" There's everything you've made of yourself so far.I'm not sure I ever felt so low.""
Finally his work was published in 1970.Instantly he had the kind of fame and success that few writers ever experience.The shadows had turned into focus of attention.
Then one day, Alex found a box filled with things he had owned years before.Inside was a paper bag with two cans and 18 cents.Suddenly he pictured himself working in that cold storage room.It reminds Alex, and anyone with a dream, of the courage and persistence   it takes to stay the course   in the shadowland.

Context: Maxwell had not held a steady job in almost two years. Today was a big day, because he was going to a job interview that he felt good about. The secretary he had talked to on the phone sounded friendly and encouraging. 
Maxwell was a typist. His fingers danced on the keyboard. However, his people skills were not nearly as good as his typing skills. Sometimes his mouth got in the way of his employment. At his last steady job, his boss had told him to start making coffee every morning. Maxwell laughed. ""I'm not making coffee,"" he said. ""It's not part of my job description."" 
""Read the employee manual again,"" his boss said. ""Your job description is anything I say it is."" 
""That's a woman's job,"" said Maxwell. ""Do it yourself."" 
His boss was still yelling as Maxwell walked out of the building. He felt great about telling off the boss. A few days later, the reality of not having a job hit home. He had to pay the rent and utility bills, and he had to eat. What was he going to do? 
He thought about apologizing and asking for his job back. But how would that look? Then again, who cares how it looks when you're almost broke? After thinking about it for another week, he finally called his boss and apologized. His boss accepted his apology, but said that he had already hired a replacement. 
Maxwell contacted a temporary job agency, which provided him enough occasional work to pay his bills. But none of the companies that he was sent to were hiring. So Maxwell was excited about finally getting an interview for a steady job. 
Maxwell's drive to the interview was disappointing. The traffic was  _ and the neighborhood looked rough. It took him 45 minutes to get there. The building was covered with graffiti.  
The interview started 30 minutes late. Not bothering to apologize, the manager lit a cigarette and took a sip from his coffee cup. He leaned back in his chair and put his feet up on his desk. He asked Maxwell a lot of questions. Maxwell thought that each question was stupider than the preceding question. The final question was, ""Where would you like to be 10 years from now?"" 
What does that have to do with typing? Maxwell wondered. Stupid questions from a rude man in a lousy neighborhood! Where would he like to be 10 years from now? 
""Anywhere but this dump!"" Maxwell said angrily, as he stood up and walked out. 
 Question:After the interview, we can infer that   _  . 
A. Maxwell will celebrate his big day. 
B. The manager will apologize to Maxwell. 
C. Maxwell will finally get this post. 
D. Maxwell will have to find another job interview.

Context: Impossible cases are not forever. While it is impossible for one person, it is possible for another. In a word, everything is possible.
Someone says, ""Success belongs to those who can look at the complex challenges offered by the world as inspiration."" So your challenges are golden opportunities for success. How can there be miracles if there are no obstacles? How will you chase the storm if there is no storm? You need challenges to reveal your ability. Success doesn't come out' of nothing; success comes from the problems you face. Those who refuse to give in
come out smiling.
Robert X. Perez says, ""The seeds of success spring from failure's ashes. ""Failure is not defeat; it is the pointer to do better than what you just did. You have to know that you are in a constant study of life. What you face is for your training. Samuel Aidoo says, ""Each failure is simply another chapter in the story of our lives. To fail is to understand what not to do. Remember it and don't give up until your goal is achieved.""
What do you do when you face difficulty? Yeah, life is difficult, but you do not give up.
Have a positive and calm outlook on your circumstances   and make the best of them. You may learn something new. You can develop mental toughness. Mental toughness means to be able to see the long-term gains rather than be put off by short-term pains. Once you have this toughness, you have the winning edge .
The only things in life you ever really regret are the chances you didn't take. You will regret when you see the consequences of not seizing the opportunities when they arose. Take chances every day! 
 Question:According to the author, success often comes to people who  _  . 
A. have good opportunities 
B. face failure 
C. don't fear difficulties 
D. have a lot of luck 
 Answer: C
Context: How many times do you have to fail at something in order to succeed? Did you know that Thomas Edison failed 10,000 times while trying to invent the light bulb? He certainly had a ""learn and do"" attitude! He was able to turn each failed experiment into a successful way to invent the light bulb. So what can we learn from this? You can adopt the ""fail forward"" strategy too.
In reality, none of us are failures. It's true that we will experience times of defeat, problems, and disasters, but remember, each one of us is meant to succeed in life. However, we must choose our fate. Henry David Thoreau said, ""Men are born to succeed, not to fail.""
We can never be forced into having a happy and successful life. Whether or not you experience success or failure is completely controlled by what you think and do. You are the only one who can choose the thoughts that will keep you from achieving the abundant life and joy that you are meant to have. No matter how difficult things may seem, say to yourself, ""I choose to be a happy and successful person.""
Why do some people get what they want and others fail? I believe that getting what you desire in life takes planning, and it doesn't just happen by luck. So how do we plan for success?
It has been proven that successful people do things more differently than unsuccessful people. They recognize the patterns of success and follow them; one of those patterns is planning. They plan what they think and do, which sets them apart. They know exactly what they desire, have an intelligent plan for getting it, and then work their plan. They know what success will cost them in terms of time, energy, and results, and they devote the right resources toward making their plans happen. 
 Question:What Henry David Thoreau said implies that   _  . 
A. everyone is able to be a success 
B. most people lack the confidence to succeed 
C. everyone can do nothing but succeed in his life 
D. no one can succeed without difficulty and suffering 
 Answer: A
Context: If there is any single factor that makes for success in living, it is the ability to profit by defeat. Every success I know have achieved because the person was able to analyze defeat and actually profit by it in his next undertaking. Confuse defeat with failure, and you are doomed   indeed to failure. For it isn't defeat that makes you fail: it is your own refusal to see in defeat the guide and encouragement to success. 
  Defeats are nothing to be ashamed of. They are routine incidents in the life of every man who achieves success. But defeat is a dead loss unless you face it without  _ , analyze  it and leave why you have failed. Defeat, in other words, can help to cure its own cause. Not only does defeat prepare us for success, but nothing can arouse within us such a compelling desire to succeed. If you let a baby grasp a rod and try to pull it away, he will hold more and more tightly until his whole weight is suspended. It is the same reaction as should give you new and greater strength every time you are defeated. If you exploit the power which defeats give, you can accomplish with it far more than you are capable of. 
 Question:Defeat is valuable because   _   . 
A. it makes you a better thinker 
B. it forces you to face it without humiliation 
C. it provides the guide to achievement. 
D. It enables you to analyze events successfully 
 Answer: C
Context: So many of us expect everything we do to be successful. We look forward to success to show us our value or to be the top of the group wherever we are. How many times in our schooling did we hope for a high mark? We want it and then feel like a failure when we don't achieve what we want. Even when we succeed we still pass that and go onto the next success and then the next. We are not often taught how to face failures.
For me, failure taught me more than success did. Success is of the moment and temporary but failure means we have ever done. It makes me stop and think. It opened my eyes and brain to different possibilities. Failure is just a choice in redoing not in giving up. Experiencing failure,I looked deeper and further.
I have a grandson who plays hockey  and as all players do,he went through a _ . So I saw he was unhappy with himself. Then I said to him, ""Why don't you think of it differently rather than being unhappy?"" And I asked, ""Scoring is your goal, right?"" He answered,""Of course."" ""Why aren't you scoring now? Do you need a readjustment ?""All of a sudden he calmed down--he was thinking of what I had just said. So in the next game I saw him trying different things to do better. Later he started scoring. Now when something is wrong, he takes the time to think it over rather than just keeping the ""failure"" mode .
Look at failure differently. Failure is what gives us power to try a different way of doing things.
It teaches us to rethink, redo, and then success will come about. Don't give up but learn to use a different way.

Context: A month went by in this manner , but a month was all I could bear .
The memory of Marguerite accompanied me wherever I went . I had loved that woman --- still loved her --- too much for her suddenly to mean nothing to me . Whatever feelings I might have for her now , I had to see her again . At once .
...
I knew Marguerite . Meeting me so unexpectedly must have thrown her into a state of great confusion . Probably , she had heard of my departure which had set her mind at rest as to the consequences of our sudden parting . But , seeing me back and coming face to face with me , pale as I was , she had sensed that my return had a purpose , and must have wondered what was going to happen .
If , when I saw her again , Marguerite had been unhappy ; if , in taking my revenge  , there had also been some way of helping her , then I might well have forgiven her , and would certainly never have dreamed of doing her any harm . But when I saw her again , she was happy , at least on the surface . Another man had ensured her the luxury  in which I had been unable to keep her . She brought shame both to my pride and my love ; she was going to have to pay for what I had suffered .
I could not remain indifferent  to what she did now . It followed that the thing that would hurt her most would be exactly for me to show indifference . Indifference , therefore , was the feeling which I now needed to pretend , not only in her presence but in the eyes of others .
I tried to put a smile on my face , and I went to call on Prudence with whom Marguerite was staying .
Prudence saw me to the door , and I returned to my apartment with tears of anger in my eyes and thirst for revenge in my heart and thought only of finding a way to make the poor creature suffer . 
 Question:What kind of feelings did the hero most probably have ? 
A. Indifference and love . 
B. Indifference and hate . 
C. Love and hate . 
D. Hate and sadness . 
 Answer: C

In it, a young girl had been followed and murdered. She felt a little frightened, walking to the station. She took a train back to the centre of the city. There were a lot of people traveling with her, so she felt much safer.
A man sitting opposite her, reading a newspaper, glanced at her. She thought nothing of it until she saw him staring at her. Remember the film and feeling very uncomfortable, she got off the train and went to the bus stop. When he got on the same bus as she did, she found that he was following her. As long as she had been with other people she wasn't frightened. But when she got off the bus, the streets were almost empty. She walked as quickly as she could. She could hear footsteps following her but she didn't dare to look around. After what seemed to have been hours, she was unable to find them, because she was so frightened. The footsteps stopped behind her. She felt a hand on her shoulder. Instead of feeling hands round her neck, however, she heard a pleasant voice. ""I apologize if I frightened you. I'm your new neighbour. I thought I recognized you in the train, but I wasn't sure.""

Context: Work is a part of living --my grandparents understood that. They lived and worked on a farm that has been in my family for 150 years. They raised chickens for eggs , pigs and cattle for meat . Cows were kept for milk and the cream, from which Grandma made butter and cheese. What little yard they had became a garden.
The Depression, therefore, didn't make much change in their lives. But it did bring an unending flow of men out of work, drifting from job to job, to the farm. The first to show up at the door of the kitchen was a man in rags. He took off his hat and quietly explained that he hadn't eaten for a while. Grandpa stood watching him a bit , then said , ""There's a stack of firewood against the fence behind the barn  . I've been needing to get it moved to the other side of the fence . You have just about enough time to finish the job before lunch .""
Grandma said a surprising thing happened. The man got a shine in his eyes and he hurried to the barn at once. She set another place at the table and made an apple pie. During lunch, the stranger didn't say much, but when he left, his shoulders had straightened. ""Nothing ruins a man like losing his self-respect,"" Grandpa later told me.
Soon after, another man showed up asking for a meal. This one was dressed in a suit and carried a small old suitcase. Grandpa came out when he heard voices. He looked at the man and then offered a handshake."" There is a stack of firewood along the fence down behind the barn I've been meaning to get it moved. It'd sure be a help to me . And we'd be pleased to have you stay for lunch."" The fellow set his suitcase aside and neatly laid his coat on top. Then he set off to work.
Grandma says she doesn't remember how many strangers they shared a meal with during those Depression days-or how many times that stack of wood got moved.

A. The Depression 
B. The Pleasure of Helping Others

Context: There would be a school party on Friday evening. The girls were talking about what they were going to wear.
""I'm going to wear a black dress, so everybody will notice me,"" said Emily. ""How about you, Linda?""
""I'm not sure. Maybe jeans, an old shirt, and a hat. People will notice me more than you!"" Linda said.

Context: On a cool November afternoon in Fleming Island, Florida, Melissa Hawkinson, 41, was driving her five-year-old twins home from school when she saw a sudden splash in Doctors Lake just ahead. What was that? She thought. As she drove up to the scene, she saw a half-submerged car sinking about 30 yards offshore. ""It was going down pretty quickly,"" Hawkinson recalls. She stopped the car near the boat ramp and ran toward the water. Water is going to be cold, she thought.
She took off her vest and leather boots, got into the icy water, and swam to the car, where she found Cameron Dorsey, five, trapped into his car as the swirling water rose around him.
Hawkinson tried to open the door, but it was locked. So she pushed and pulled hard on the partially open window until she could reach through and unlock the door. She pulled the boy free, swam to shore, and handed him off to onlookers who were only watching them on a dock. The driver, the boy's suicidal father, swam back to land on his own. Afterward, Hawkinson sat on the shore wrapped in a blanket. ""For ten or 15 minutes, I couldn't stop shaking,"" she said.
There's nothing visibly extraordinary about Melissa Hawkinson, an energetic stay-at-home mom with brown hair and a sweet smile. Yet something made her different from the dockside onlookers that day. Why do some people act quickly, willing to take a risk for a stranger? What makes them run toward danger rather than away from it? Hawkinson, the Granite Mountain Hotshots (,)---19 of whom lost their life this past summer in Arizona--- every hero who puts his or her life on the line to save another: what makes them brave?
Moreover, can bravery be learned, or is it a quality with which you are born? The answer is complex. Bravery taps the mind, brain and heart. It comes from instinct, training and sympathy. Today, neurologists, psychologists and other researchers are studying bravery, trying to uncover the mystery. 
 Question:What is the writer's purpose of writing this passage? 
A. To set us thinking what makes people brave. 
B. To call on us to learn from such people as Hawkinson. 
C. To remind people of risk while saving others. 
D. To show people bravery can be learned.

Context: Teenager Jake Deham was skiing with his family in the US when he fell over and lost one of his skis. His family didn't know that he had a problem. They kept on skiing. When they got to the foot of the mountain, there was no sign of Jake.
Jake couldn't find his ski anywhere. In the end, he decided to take off his other ski and walk down the mountain. But he couldn't work out the right way to go.
It was now getting dark and he was a long way from any place of safety. He knew that he might die that night in the cold temperatures. But Jake kept calm. At home, Jake watched a lot of programmes about living in difficult situations. He remembered the advice from these programmes and knew that he should build a hole in the snow. He made a hole so the wind couldn't blow into it. Outside his hole, the temperature fell to a dangerous -15degC that night, but inside it Jake was safe from the cold.
After the long evening passed, Jake began to think his way out. He had to get down the mountain. The TV programmes always said, ""If you are lost, you should find someone else's tracks  through the snow and follow them."" ""I wanted to live my life."" remembered Jake, ""So I got up and I found some ski tracks and I followed those."" He walked and walked and finally saw lights...
His mum was very happy when she heard her son was saved. Amazingly, Jake didn't even have to go to hospital. He got through the terrible experience without any injuries.
So, the next time someone says that watching TV is a waste of time, think of Jake. Sometimes TV can save your life!

Context: Wide awake in Aunt Bet's Southern house, Annie Van Lew shivered at the sounds of distant guns. It was bad enough that America was at war, but the young Virginia girl was not used to battles being fought this close.  _ .Annie sat up in bed and listened.Had a stranger broken in? Earlier, the family had heard that captured officers recently escaped from a prison nearby.
   Quietly opening her bedroom door, Annie walked out. A figure in a black gown was walking down the hall. It was Aunt Bet, carrying a candle in one hand and a plate of fried chicken in the other.
   Annie followed her aunt to a stairway at the far end of the house. Aunt Bet climbed to the top, and opened a door leading to the attic . Annie followed closely behind.
   In the attic, Aunt Bet stopped at a chest of drawers, moved it aside, and felt along the wall behind it. Slowly a door sprang open, revealing a hidden room. A thin man stepped out of the opening. As Aunt Bet handed him the plate of food, the young man saw Annie in the doorway and froze.
Desperately shaking her head ""no"", the girl raised one finger to her lips. The officer understood and shifted his look. Quickly Annie went back downstairs and hid, waiting until after Aunt Bet left to return. Back inside the attic,Annie called softly to the man inside, who told her where to find the hidden spring.
   Soon the young officer stood in the open doorway. A small candle burned on a table behind him and, in its soft light, Annie studied his face. Clear eyes reflected the calm of one who faced death bravely.
   Smiling, he said,""What trouble you should have gotten into if your aunt had turned around!"" That night, Annie learned Aunt Bet was one of many daring Southerners whose hatred  of slavery drove them to risk their lives by spying for the North. The girl chatted as she dared, wishing her new friend luck when he said he would leave at dawn.
    Back in her room, Annie felt proud and was determined to guard her family's secret to the end. 
 Question:How did Annie's feelings change from the beginning of the story to the end of the story?

B. In the beginning she was angry; in the end she became fearful

Context: Around six weeks ago, Kaileen came running into the house, just getting off the bus from school. She was all excited about a story about homeless pets because of Hurricane   Katrina and all that was going on to help them. She said that this information came from her animal newspaper (your KIND News). Kaileen has a great love and compassion   for animals, so her excitement did not surprise me. Her next ideas, however, did. She said that we should go around right then to our neighbors and collect all their change to send to the animal shelters  .
         I thought this was a school project, but in fact, it was not. This was what Kaileen wanted to do on her own! Well, it warmed me all over. To see your child so willing to help others just lets you feel that maybe you had done something right in raising   her. 
         Anyway, I told her to make a card and send it out to our neighbors first. With the help of her older brother, Kaileen soon made a lovely card that asked our neighbors to help these pets by giving their spare change. She gave them a few days and a date she would come by to pick up any donations  .  
         Well, I had to go out and buy a donation box. Kaileen collected $279.50!!! I just thought you would like to know how KIND News had touched a little one's heart and given her the idea to show her compassion for animals. Thank you -- we really enjoy your paper. 
 Question:From the passage we learn that KIND News   _  . 
A. collects donations for homeless people 
B. sets up many shelters for homeless animals 
C. tells children how to keep pets healthy 
D. encourages children to help homeless pets

Context: One day, Susie was unhappy when she came home from school. ""What's the matter, my dear?"" asked her mother, drawing her to her side and smiling.
""All our class must hand in compositions tomorrow. We must write 12 lines at least. But I can never write one. I'll have to go to school without a composition, for I won't copy one from a book, or ask you or papa to write one for me.""
""That's right,"" said her mother. ""You'll be happier with a poor composition, if it's your own, than with a fine one written by somebody else. But cheer up. Run into the garden and play. I'll call you in half an hour. Don't think about your composition now. Just have a good time.""
It seemed just a few minutes to Susie before she heard her mother calling her. She went into the house immediately -- her hands full of sweet flowers, and her face red with exercise.
Then her mother asked her to sit by the window with a nice piece of paper and a pencil, and write something about what she could see. ""Never mind your composition; do this to please me, and we'll talk about that later.""
Although Susie thought her mother's request was strange, she knew she always had a good reason for everything she did. So she did as her mother requested.
As she looked out, she first saw the western sky and some bright, sunset clouds. ""Oh, mother, what a sunset!""
""Don't talk. Just write.""
The pencil began moving rapidly across the paper. She wrote about the sunset clouds, the look of the distant hills, the streets, the river, the garden with its flowers, and the birds flying past the window. She forgot all about the terrible composition!
Just as she had reached the bottom of the page, her mother came in and said with a smile, ""Well, Susie, how does that composition come on?""
""Composition! You told me not to think about it, and I've never thought of it once. I've had such a nice time writing about what I could see from the window.""
Mrs. Smith took the paper and read what Susie had written. She said, ""There, Susie, that's a very nice composition, really.""
""A composition! Is that a composition?"" Susie asked in surprise.
""Yes, my dear, and a very good one, too, if we find a title for it,"" replied her mother. Then she added, ""I'm sure it will please your teacher, as it does me. You see, it's easy enough to write a composition if you have anything interesting to write about."" 
 Question:Susie was unhappy when she came home because   _  . 
A. she was punished by her teacher 
B. she couldn't write a composition 
C. she forgot to take her composition home

Context: As a child, I was really afraid of the dark and of getting lost. These fears were very real and caused me some uncomfortable moments.
Maybe it was the strange way things looked and sounded in my own room at night that scared me so much. There was never complete darkness, but always a streetlight or passing car lights, which made clothes on the back of a chair take on the shape of a wild animal. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the curtains seem to move when there was no wind. A very low sound in the floor would seem a hundred times louder than in the day. My imagination   would run wild, and my heart would beat fast. I would lie very still so that the ""enemy"" would not discover me.
Another of my childhood fears was that I would get lost, especially on the way home from school. Every morning I got on the school bus right near my home. That was no problem. After school, though, when all the buses were lined up along the street, I was afraid that I would get in the wrong one and be taken to some other strange places. On school or family trips to a park or a museum, I wouldn't let the leaders out of my sight.
Perhaps one of the worst fears of all I had as a child was that of not being liked or accepted by others. Being popular was so important to me then, and the fear of not  being liked was a serious one.
One of the processes growing up is being able to realize and overcome our fears. Understanding the things that scared us as children helps us achieve greater success later in life. 
 Question:When she went to some other places, she would   _  . 
A. walk away without others 
B. follow others closely 
C. take a bus by herself

There were a lot of people traveling with her, so she felt much safer.
A man sitting opposite her, reading a newspaper, glanced at her. She thought nothing of it until she saw him staring at her. Remember the film and feeling very uncomfortable, she got off the train and went to the bus stop. When he got on the same bus as she did, she found that he was following her. As long as she had been with other people she wasn't frightened. But when she got off the bus, the streets were almost empty. She walked as quickly as she could. She could hear footsteps following her but she didn't dare to look around. After what seemed to have been hours, she was unable to find them, because she was so frightened. The footsteps stopped behind her. She felt a hand on her shoulder. Instead of feeling hands round her neck, however, she heard a pleasant voice. ""I apologize if I frightened you. I'm your new neighbour. I thought I recognized you in the train, but I wasn't sure.""

Context: Although 19-year-old George Dennehy is armless, he isn't letting that stop him from pursuing  his dreams and sharing his passion   with the world.
Born without arms, the young boy's birth parents left him. Luckily, a warm-hearted couple _ him and took good care of him. However, his new parents never allowed him to use his disability as an excuse to be lazy. When George turned eight, they asked him to sign up  for cello  lessons. The instrument  is tough even for people who have the use of both their hands, so it was even more challenging for George, who had to learn to play it with his feet.

His music talent caught the eye of an American rock band who invited him to perform alongside them at a ten-day-long music festival.
The experience has inspired  this once shy boy to pursue a career  in music. He has also become a motivational   speaker who encourages both able and disabled people to pursue their dreams, no matter how impossible these dreams may sound.
Geoge Dennehy is armless, he isn't letting that stop him from pursuing  his dreams and sharing his passion with the world.

A. His adoptive parents 
B. His birth parents

 Answer: C
Context: In high school, ""cool"" is the rule, so teenagers will do anything to avoid possibly embarrassing situations.
But not Samantha Elton, 15. She seeks them out. And if she can make a fool of herself as in the process, well, that's even better.
For the past two years, Elton, has been a practitioner of improvisation, doing things that others would be embarrassed to consider.
Elton is a member of High School Jesters, a group that teaches improvisation techniques to students. The group was founded two years ago by Nicholas Kopatich, himself a keen improviser.
""I was sitting in my dorm room and some friends were having chats about comedy and improvisation,"" Kopatich recalls. They asked for lessons after Kopatich told them he had improvisation experience. The small group turned out to be pretty good at it, so they did a show for the dorm. And things snowballed.
While even her mother marvels at Elton's ability to get up in front of audience without a script to fall back on, the teen enjoys such opportunities. Performing improvisation comes with a certain freedom that theater doesn't provide.
""What I like about it the most is that I don't have to be a certain character or a certain way, and because of that I can't get anything wrong,"" Elton says, ""I get to write the story while I'm doing it.""
Monica Elton, Samantha's mom, thinks the workshops are a valuable outlet that a lot of students may not get in their schools. High school kids don't usually like to act silly or look uncool, she says, but improvisation teaches them that it's OK to have flaws.
""I like to think we give kids positively that allows them to gain confidence,"" says Brent Mukai, a High School Jesters instructor. The great thing about improvisation is that it is an art form that is open to anyone. But there's more to it than getting up in front of audience and telling jokes or acting silly.
""You don't need to be the most amazing actress to be an improviser,"" Samantha Elton says, ""It's really a place where I can show people my creativity. I can paint pictures for people and entertain others.""
It's really free. 
 Question:It can be inferred that Kopatich formed High School Jesters   _  . 
A. on purpose 
B. by accident 
C. for business 
D. out of curiosity

Context: When we think of leadership, we often think of strength and power. But what are these really, and how do they operate?
Leadership today is not about forcing others to do things. If this is even possible, it is short-term, and tends to backfire. If you order someone to do something against their will, they may do it because they feel they must, but the anger they feel will do more harm in the long-term, They will also experience fear.
Fear causes the thinking brain to shut down, making the person unable to function at his or her best. If they associate you with this emotion of fear. They will become less functional around you, and you will have succeeded in not only shooting yourself in the foot, but possibly making a very good employee or partner unable to perform effectively. Fear has no place in leadership.
The way we influence people in a lasting way is by our own character, and our understanding and use of emotion. We can order someone to do something, which may be part of the work day; or we can employ them at the emotional level, so they became fully devoted to the projects and provide some of their own motivation  . Today's work place is all about relationships.
Anyone works harder in a positive environment in which they are recognized and valued as a human being as well as a worker. Everyone produces just a bit more for someone they like. Leaders understand the way things work. They know the pay check is not the single most motivating factor   in the work life of most people.
The true strength of leadership is an inner strength that comes from the confidence of emotional intelligence--knowing your own emotions, and how to handle them, and those of others. Developing your emotional intelligence is the single best thing you can do if you want to develop your relationships with people around you, which is the key to the leadership skills. 
 Question:An employee may have a feeling of fear in the work place when   _  . 
A. he is forced to do thing 
B. he cannot work at his best 
C. he feels his brain shut down 
D. he thinks of his work as too heavy 
 Answer: A
Context: No one gets through life without experiencing many disappointments. Strangely, though, most people seem unprepared for disappointment and react to it in negative ways. They feel depressed or try to escape from their troubles instead of using disappointment as an opportunity for growth.
One negative reaction to disappointment is depression. A woman trying to win a promotion, for example, works hard for over a year in her department. Helen is so sure she will get the promotion. However, the boss names one of Helen's co-workers for the spot. Deeply depressed, Helen loses her enthusiasm for her job and can barely force herself to show up every day. Helen tells herself that she is a failure and that doing a good job just isn't worth the work.
Another negative reaction to disappointment is the desire to escape. Kevin fails to get into the college his brother is attending, the college that was the focus of all his dreams, and decides to escape his disappointment. Why worry about college at all? Instead, he covers up his real feelings by giving up on his school-work and getting completely involved with friends, parties, and ""good times"".
The positive way to react to disappointment is to use it as a chance for growth. This isn't easy, but it's the only useful way to deal with an inevitable part of life. Helen, the woman who was not promoted, could have handled her disappointment by looking at other options. If her boss did not recognize her talent and hard work, perhaps she could transfer to another department. Or she could ask the boss how to improve her performance so that she could prepare for the next promotion. Kevin, the boy who didn't get into the college of his choice, should look into other schools. Going to another college may encourage him to be his own person, step out of his brother's shadow, and realize that being turned down by one college isn't a final judgment on his abilities or potential.
Disappointments are unwelcome, but regular visitors to everyone's life. We can feel depressed about them or we can try to escape from them. The best thing, though, is to accept a disappointment and then try to use it somehow: Step over the unwelcome visitor on the doorstep and get on with life. 
 Question:From the context, the word ""option"" (Para.4) means   _  . 
A. way

Context: Fifteen years ago, I entered the Boston Globe, which was a temple to me then. It wasn't easy getting hired. But once you were there, I found, you were in.
Globe jobs were for life-guaranteed until retirement. For 15 years I had prospered there--moving from an ordinary reporter to senior editor. I would have a lifetime of security if I stuck with it. Instead, I had made a decision to leave. I entered my boss's office. Would he be angry? I wondered. He had a famous temper. ""Matt, we have to have a talk,"" I began. ""I came to the Globe when I was twenty-four. Now I' m forty. There' s a lot I want to do in life. I'm resigning.  "" ""To another paper?"" he asked. I reached into my coat pocket, but didn't say anything. I handed him a letter that explained everything. It said that I was leaving to start a new media company. We were at a rare turning point in history. I wanted to be directly engaged in the change. ""I' m glad for you,"" he said, quite out of my expectation. ""I just came from a board of directors meeting and it was seventy-five percent discouraging news. Some of that we can deal with. But much of it we can' t,"" he went on. ""I wish you all the luck in the world,"" he concluded. ""And if it doesn't work out, remember, there is always a place here for you.""
Then I went out of his office, walking through the newsroom for more good-byes. Everybody was saying congratulations. Everybody--even though I'd be risking all the financial security I had carefully built up.
Later, I had a final talk with Bill Taylor, chairman and publisher of the Boston Globe. He had turned the Globe into a billion-dollar property. ""I' m resigning, Bill,"" I said. He listened while I gave him the story. He wasn't looking angry either. After a pause, he said, ""Golly, I wish I were in your shoes. "" 
 Question:If the writer stayed with the Globe    _    . 
A. he would be able to realize his lifetime dreams. 
B. he would set up a new media company 
C. he would never be allowed to develop his ambitions 
D. he would never have to worry about his future life

Context: A month went by in this manner , but a month was all I could bear .
The memory of Marguerite accompanied me wherever I went . I had loved that woman --- still loved her --- too much for her suddenly to mean nothing to me . Whatever feelings I might have for her now , I had to see her again . At once .
...
I knew Marguerite . Meeting me so unexpectedly must have thrown her into a state of great confusion . Probably , she had heard of my departure which had set her mind at rest as to the consequences of our sudden parting . But , seeing me back and coming face to face with me , pale as I was , she had sensed that my return had a purpose , and must have wondered what was going to happen .
If , when I saw her again , Marguerite had been unhappy ; if , in taking my revenge  , there had also been some way of helping her , then I might well have forgiven her , and would certainly never have dreamed of doing her any harm . But when I saw her again , she was happy , at least on the surface . Another man had ensured her the luxury  in which I had been unable to keep her . She brought shame both to my pride and my love ; she was going to have to pay for what I had suffered .
I could not remain indifferent  to what she did now . It followed that the thing that would hurt her most would be exactly for me to show indifference . Indifference , therefore , was the feeling which I now needed to pretend , not only in her presence but in the eyes of others .
I tried to put a smile on my face , and I went to call on Prudence with whom Marguerite was staying .
Prudence saw me to the door , and I returned to my apartment with tears of anger in my eyes and thirst for revenge in my heart and thought only of finding a way to make the poor creature suffer . 
 Question:What kind of feelings did the hero most probably have ? 
A. Indifference and love . 
B. Indifference and hate . 
C. Love and hate . 
D. Hate and sadness .

Context: A couple had a son eleven years after they married. They were a loving couple and the boy was _ . When the boy was around four years old, one day the father was very tired after work so he asked his wife to pick up their son. The mother, who was very busy in the kitchen, totally forgot about it.
Later the boy lost his way on the street. When the son was found missing, the mother hurried to look for him, but she didn't find him. The mother felt very sad and didn't know how to face her husband.
When the father went to the police station after hearing that the son was missing, he looked at his wife and said just four words. What do you think the four words were? The husband just said ""I love you, darling."" www.zxxk.com
The son was missing. If she had picked him up earlier, this would not have happened. There is no point in blaming   anyone. His wife had also lost her only child. What his wife needed at that moment was comfort and understanding from her husband. That is what the husband gave his wife. Several weeks later, with the help of the police, the couple finally found their lost son. The family's relationship became stronger over that time.
Sometimes we spend lots of time asking who is to blame. We miss many chances to give each other support and let each other feel the warmth of human relationships. Get rid of all your unwillingness to forgive, selfishness, and fears and you will find the world is much more wonderful. 
 Question:Why didn't the father pick the boy up himself? 
A. He was very lazy. 
B. He thought the mother had picked him up. 
C. He forgot to pick him up. 
D. He was too tired to do it.

Context: Gabby Douglas stood beneath the Rio Olympic Arena, still in her Team USA leotard, trying hard to understand how she had become the most unpatriotic athlete in Rio. Tears filled in her eyes. She tried hard to talk but no words came out. Her pauses were long and uncomfortable.
""I've been trying to stay off the Internet because there's so much negativity,"" she said. The attacks against her have been everywhere these last few days. The bullies blamed her for not putting her hand over her heart while the US national song played. Besides, some other people attacked her for not jumping up and cheering hard enough for team-mates at the all-around final.

It showed on Sunday, in Douglas's final performance of this Olympics and maybe in the Games ever. Douglas finished sixth in the uneven bars, far from the medal stand she owned four years ago in London, and shook her head, confused. What had she done wrong? Nothing made sense.
""I mean, you do [Olympics] for your country, and you do it for yourself, how have I offended them? What have I done? I was standing in respect for USA. I'm coming out there representing them to the best of my abilities, so how would I be in disrespect? 
 Question:Why was Douglas heartbroken? 
A. Because she lost the chance to take part in the Olympic Games. 
B. Because she didn't win any medal. 
C. Because she was criticized by many people for her unintentional behaviors. 
D. Because she made a big mistake.

Context: Few people would disagree that email makes our lives easier. But misusing email can cause problems. And I'm not talking about hitting the ""reply all"" button when you didn't mean to.
Answering all those emails and processing all that information can overload the brain,causing stress.
So says the Future Work Centre, a business based in London.This company carries out psychological research on people's experiences in their workplaces.
The centre's Richard MacKinnon was the lead writer of a report on messaging habits. He calls email a double-edged sword. In other works,email can be both good and bad. Americans also use the saying cuts both ways for something like a double-edged sword.
But back to the culture of emailing,Emails provide a useful way to communicate. But they could add to tension in the mind,causing stress. Come rain or shine, some office workers are under pressure to read and answer emails all day long.
Jonathan Rowe has on office job in London. His complaint is a common one:too many emails.
He says reading work emails when you're at home blurs the boundaries between work and leisure.
Psychologists are concemed about the pressure that workers bring on themselves. Dr. Richard MacKinnon spoke with VOA News on Skype.
He says that email can be a valuable, time-saving communication tool. But it can also be a  source of stress and even anger for many of us. He adds that the stress does not come from the number of emails you get. The problems result from when and how you deal with them.
According to the study,there are two very stressful email behaviors. One is leaving email on all day-and never signing off. The other is reading and answering emails early in the day and late at night.
Which jobs are most affected by email stress?
But not all jobs are equally stressed by email. The jobs most affected by email stress are:
* marketing,
* public relations,
* media and
* Information Technology
Educational experts have also written several reports on how email overloads are stressing out teachers.
Ways to cut down on your email stress
MacKinnon says bad email behaviors are linked to higher levels of stress in office workers. The Future Work Centre report gives several suggestions on avoiding email stress.
*Use email with a plan. Do not just react to endless email alerts. If you use an email application, or app ,on your device, close it down when you want to be left alone.
*If you need to communicate with a co-worker,call or better still walk to their office and talk about it.
*Be careful with the ""reply all"" option. For example, if you are accepting an invitation to attend training, just write back to those who need to know. Trust me. Other workers on that mailing list will thank you.
*And accept the fact that if a matter is urgent employers will call you about it.
The Future Work Centre report claims that in 2014, people sent an estimated 196.3 billion emails. The average adult spent more than an hour a day answering emails.
Email is certainly not going anywhere. So, it is important to control your emails and not the other way around. 
 Question:Dr.Richard MacKinnon holds the idea that  _  . 
A. it is the emails you get daily that puts you under pressure. 
B. it is the way of processing emails that makes you feel stressed. 
C. it is necessary that you read and answer your emails at noon. 
D. it is important that you realize where a source of stress comes from. 
 Answer: B
Context: Email has brought the art of letter writing back to life, but some experts think the resulting spread of bad English does more harm than good.
Email is a form of communication that is changing, for the worse, the way we write and use language, say some communication researchers. It is also changing the way we interact  and build relationship. These are a few of the recently recognized features of email, say experts, which should cause individuals and organizations to rethink the way they use email.
""Email has increased the spread of careless writing habits,"" says Naomi Baron, a professor of linguistics  at an American university. She says the poor spelling, grammar, punctuation and sentence structure of emails reflect  a growing unconcern about the way we write.
Baron argues that we shouldn't forgive and forget the poor writing often shown in email. ""The more we use email and its tasteless writing, the more it becomes the normal way of writing,"" the professor says.
Others say that despite its poor writing, email has finished what several generations of English teachers couldn't: it has made writing fashionable again.
""Email is a critical new communication technology."" says Ian Lancashire, a professor of English at Toronto University. ""It fills the gap between spoken language and the formal methods of writing that existed before email. It is the purest form of written speech.""
Lancashire says email has the mysterious ability to get people who are usually scared by writing to get their thoughts flowing easily onto a blank screen. He says this is because of email's close similarity to speech. ""It's like a circle of four or five people around a campfire,"" he says.
Still, he accepts that this new-found freedom to express themselves often gets people into trouble. Emails sent in a day almost exceed  the number of letters mailed in a year. But more people are recognizing the content of a typical email message is not often exact. 
 Question:In Lancashire's opinion, email is a wonderful technology because   _  . 
A. it can be useful all over the world 
B. it is the fastest way to communicate 
C. we can express ourselves in a free way 
D. we can save a lot of paper 
 Answer: C
Context: People tend to become more personal and hide less of themselves when using email.Researchers from Open University in Britain have found in a recent study that there are good reasons for this.
The team of researchers asked 83 pairs of students, all strangers to each other, to solve a problem.They had to discuss this question: If only five people in the world could be saved from a world disaster, who should they be? The pairs of students had to talk over the problem either face to face or by computers.Dr.Johnson said, ""They told their partners four times as much about themselves when they talked over the Internet as when they talked face to face.When the computers were fitted with cameras so that students could see each other, this limited the personal side of the conversation."" 
Generally the information was not extremely personal.It was mainly about things such as where they went to school, or where they used to live.But some students discussed their love stories, and personal childhood experiences.
Dr.Johnson believes that emailing encourages people to focus on themselves.And when they do this, they become more open , especially if there are no cameras.""If you cannot see the other person, it becomes easier to talk about yourself.This is because you are not thinking what the other person is thinking of you.So emailing has become the modern way of talking."" said Dr.Johnson.However, this style of talking is not entirely new.""In the 19th century people started to use the 'telegraph' to communicate.Now the same kind of thing has happened and people ended up speaking more freely.""
Dr.Johnson thinks that e-mailers need to know about these effects of emailing, especially when they start work in a company.""If you don't know about it, you could find yourself saying more about yourself than you wanted to ."" 
 Question:In the writer's opinion, one should   _  . 
A. focus on oneself when emailing 
B. talk more freely in email than usual 
C. discuss any subject that one wants to 
D. consider how one uses email at work 
 Answer: D
Context: Even with the multimedia excitement of the web. Electronic Mail, email, is the most frequently used application of the Internet. Many people who have a chance to use the Internet at school, home, and work. They use the Internet for no other purposes than to send or receive emails.
It's all very easy. You prepare the message, log onto  the Internet, and send it. The message first goes to your Internet Service Provider's mail server, which in turn sends it to the recipient's  mail server. On the way your message may go through several servers, each reading the name in order to send it to the right server. The message then remains in the recipient's mail email server until he requests it by ""checking his mail"".
The benefits of emails are obvious: mostly it's quick. Also, many people feel that the rules for regular mails don't apply to email, making it less formal, which in turn make email easier to write and send.
It's not just friends and coworkers that are receiving emails. Wherever you look, the Web is providing email addresses. This has made communication between strangers easier than ever. You can read an interesting article online and immediately send the author an email. Anyone who posts his email address on a Web page is saying he wants to receive email.
There are places you can go if you don't know someone's email address. Check out Bigfoot, the Internet Address Finder, or Netscape's Email Directories for more information.
Email is one of the services offered by your Internet Service Provider--a service that you're applying for every month.

A. the multimedia excitement 
B. different websites

Context: Jimmy is an automotive mechanic, but he lost his job a few months ago. He has a good heart, but always feared applying for a new job.
One day, he gathered up all his strength and decided to attend a job interview. His appointment was at 10 am and it was already 8:30. While waiting for a bus to the office where he was supposed to be interviewed, he saw an elderly man wildly kicking the tyre of his car. Obviously there was something wrong with the car. Jimmy immediately went up to lend him a hand. When Jimmy finished working on the car, the old man asked him how much he should pay for the service. Jimmy said there was no need to pay him; he just helped someone in need, and he had to rush for an interview. Then the old man said, ""Well, I could take you to the office for your interview. It's the least I could do. Please, I insist."" Jimmy agreed.
Upon arrival, Jimmy found a long line of applicants waiting to be interviewed. Jimmy still had some grease on him after the car repair, but he did not have much time to wash it off or have a change of shirt. One by one, the applicants left the interviewer's office with disappointed look on their faces. Finally his name was called. The interviewer was sitting on a large chair facing the office window. Rocking the chair back and forth, he asked, ""Do you really need to be interviewed?"" Jimmy's heart sank. ""With the way I look now, how could I possibly pass this interview?"" he thought to himself.
Then the interviewer turned the chair and to Jimmy's surprise, it was the old man he helped earlier in the morning. It turned out he was the General Manager of the company.
""Sorry I had to keep you waiting, but I was pretty sure I made the right decision to have you as part of our workforce before you even stepped into the office. I just know you'd be a trustworthy worker. Congratulations!"" Jimmy sat down and they shared a cup of well-deserved coffee as he landed himself a new job. 
 Question:Why did the old man offer Jimmy a ride? 
A. He was also to be interviewed 
B. He needed a traveling companion 
C. He always helped people in need 
D. He was thankful to Jimmy

Context: Recently I fully understood that a little favor could really make a big difference. My daughter and I were, accidentally, in time to catch a falling heart just before it hit the ground.
It all started when Charlene, one of my co-volunteers at the library, asked if I could do her duty on Tuesday since her doctor appointment had been unexpectedly changed. I agreed, which meant I  was home on Friday instead of volunteering as previously planned.
My daughter, Mary, managers a book store in town. Mid-morning, she called to ask me for help. Would I buy a fifty dollar gift card, birthday card, and cake for one of Mary's assistant managers, Cindy?
Mary explained she had to call Cindy in to take the place of another assistant manager who was sick, but felt terrible about it when she discovered it was Cindy's birthday. Cindy insisted that it was just fine. But that was not what Mary thought, so she gathered enough money from other employees to throw a surprise party for Cindy. Since neither Mary, nor any of the other employees, could leave to pick up the _ , they were turning to me for help. Days later, Mary told me the wonderful rest of the story, ""Cindy cried and cried when we surprised her. After the party, Cindy told us that her boyfriend had chosen that morning to break up with her. To top that off, she only had 26 cents left in her bank account.""
We were surprised at the series of unexpected events that took place in order to circle Cindy with love and catch her falling heart just before it hit the ground. 
 Question:What can we learn about Mary? 
A. Shewasalearned careerwoman.

Context: There was a king who gave his daughter a beautiful diamond necklace. The necklace was stolen and his people in the kingdom searched everywhere but could not find it. So the king asked to search for it and put a reward for$50,000 for anyone who found it.
One day, a clerk was walking home along a river when he saw something shinning in the river and when he looked, he saw the diamond necklace. He decided to try and catch it to get the $50,000 reward.
He put his hand in the river and tried to catch the necklace, but somehow missed it and didn't catch it. He took his hand out and looked again and the necklace was still there. He tried again.
But strangely, he still missed the necklace! He came out and started walking away, feeling sad. Just then, an old man walking by saw him, and asked him what was the matter. The clerk didn't want to share the secret with him, thinking he might take the necklace for himself, so he refused to tell him anything.
The old man could see this man was troubled. He again asked the clerk to tell him the problem and promised that he would not tell anyone about it. The clerk told him about the necklace and how he tried and tried to catch it, but kept failing.
The old man then told him that perhaps he should try looking upward, toward the branches of the tree, instead of in the river. The clerk looked up and true enough, the necklace was hanging on the branch of a tree. He had been trying to take a reflection of the real necklace all this time. 
 Question:What might be the best title for the passage?

Context: You probably remember me from the other day. I was the one who reacted very slowly to the green traffic light. When you honked your horn ,I realized I was holding up traffic, so please accept my apology. However, I do want you to know why I seemed in a confused state. You see, I was just at the doctor's office getting the results of the examination I had two weeks ago, and I was wondering how I would tell my husband and children that I had cancer. There were still tears in my eyes, so,quite simply I didn't even see the lights change. Perhaps I should not have been driving, but I didn't want to miss my appointment.
I was in the express lane at the supermarket without thinking and moving. Please accept my apology. My mind was on my youngest daughter who ran away from home, and she?'just sixteen. I was so worried then. You see, she somehow got in with the wrong crowd and started using drugs and drinking. I was remembering what a pretty little girl she had been most of her life. I know you were unhappy along with others in line. Please, accept my apology.
I remember you from the store last week. I was so mean to you, when you were doing your job to the best of your ability. I acted so childishly. Please accept my apology. You see, I arrived home from work just yesterday and discovered that my wife had left me, but I should never have taken it out on you. Please, accept my apology.
The above are imagined incidents, and yet they expressed a very real truth. The old saying about judging others before you ""have walked a mile in their shoes"" is a much needed reminder. Perhaps we all could try to learn the fact that there are problems and situation in the lives of others which we are totally unaware of. So, maybe before we get angry in similar situations, we should think a moment and understand that things may be going on in other's lives which have caused them to be slower, absent-minded or angry. Patience, as they say, is a virtue. 
 Question:What does the author mainly want to express? 
A. Learn to accept others?apology. 
B. We need more patience and understanding. 
C. Be patient when you are in line. 
D. The patient should not drive to the office.

Context: Gabby Douglas stood beneath the Rio Olympic Arena, still in her Team USA leotard, trying hard to understand how she had become the most unpatriotic athlete in Rio. Tears filled in her eyes. She tried hard to talk but no words came out. Her pauses were long and uncomfortable.
""I've been trying to stay off the Internet because there's so much negativity,"" she said. The attacks against her have been everywhere these last few days. The bullies blamed her for not putting her hand over her heart while the US national song played.

C. Because she was criticized by many people for her unintentional behaviors.

Context: Several overseas trips with the family have taught us that they can be rewarding, but you always have to be careful of pickpockets.
On a lovely visit to Paris an encounter with a pickpocket gave the would-be thief a little more than he _ 
While walking down the famous Champs Elysee, I was astonished to feel someone unzip my handbag and remove my purse. I turned to glimpse a young man turning away and pretending to be absorbed in the mouth-watering contents on display in a bakery window.
Being only a teenager at the time, I had no idea what to do. So I tapped the young man in question on the shoulder and said.
""Excuse me can you please give me back my purse?""
Of course the pickpocket had no idea what I was saying (and didn't want to know) and proceeded to shrug his shoulders and basically say (in French) ""I don't speak English""?
Meanwhile my Mother (a Scotswoman with a bad temper), came to see why I had stopped walking and what was going on. When I informed her of the situation she lost control and started yelling at the thief who still stood there making gestures in French while a crazy Scotswoman harangued  him. At this stage we were starting to attract onlookers, and when my Mother started hitting the young man with her handbag the would-be thief decided it was time to get away.
Luckily, amid all the disorder the thief lost his control of my purse, and as he made a break-for-it, my purse dropped to the ground! I quickly snatched it up and for the rest of vacation we walked around with our handbags clutched against our chests!

Context: Sherlock Holmes was the greatest detective in history. His astonishing power of observation and analysis meant that he was able to solve cases which left the real police completely
. As a problem solver in the law forced business, he was a knowledgeable person equal to Superman, the comic book hero.
Like Superman, of course, Holmes did not exist. He was the creation of a Scottish doctor and novelist Arthur Conan Doyle, and remains one of the most famous literary fiction characters of all time.
Holmes' general rule when trying to solve a case was as follows: completely get rid of the impossible. Then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
It's said that Holmes' powers of deduction   were superhuman, particularly his ability to process information from what he observed. In a story called The Boscombe Valley Mystery, Holmes examines the area near a lake where a murder has been committed. The local police have already searched the area and found no clues. Holmes spends ten minutes in the area, and announces that the murderer ""is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears thick-soled shooting boots and a gray coat, smokes Indian cigars, uses a cigar holder, and carries a penknife in his pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be enough to aid us in our search."" Needless to say, he has found evidence to support all of these statements.
The fictional Holmes lived in an apartment at 221 Baker Street, a real street in Central London. When Conan Doyle wrote about Holmes, there was no 221 Baker Street, but after the street was extended northwards, there was. There is currently a bank at that address.
The fact that Holmes didn't actually exist doesn't stop thousands of people writing to him for help every year.The bank kindly responds to every letter they receive with the following message: ""Mr. Holmes thanks you for your letter. At the moment he is retired in Sussex, keeping bees, and does not undertake detective work nowadays."" 
 Question:When letters are written to Holmes,    _ 
A. he answers letters when he receives them 
B. his secretary answers them for him. 
C. the bank at 221 Baker Street where he used to live sends the letters back 
D. the bank at his address replies that Holmes is no longer working as a detective 
 Answer: D
Context: Stop wasting your time thinking of reasons for your failures.  Instead, realize that the seeds of success were planted within you when you were born. Only you have the power to make those seeds grow.
The seeds, and the power to grow them, are contained in the most awesome machine ever created: the human mind. Success is a choice and not a chance. You were born a winner. You were born rich. You can be a success if only you make the right choice.
You cannot be successful without first developing your self-confidence. Your level of self-confidence is always based on the degree of control that you are able to exercise over yourself, and thus over your life. People with low self-confidence are people who do not believe that they have any power, or responsibility for their lives. They are always victims. They are leaves tossed   by the winds of chance blown about with any sudden change in the weather.
You can exercise control over your life only to the degree that you believe you are responsible for everything that happens in your life.  Failures think that everything happens by accident and chance. Successful people realize that they are responsible.
Everything happens as a result of something.  If we can identify  the cause, we can control the effect. We are responsible for what we choose to think and believe. One generally rises to the level that one expects. We are responsible for setting our expectations. Our success is dependent upon our level of confidence.
In all areas of your life, whether they are financial, physical, or spiritual, you are responsible. Once you recognize this, accept it, and firmly believe it. You are on the road to success. 
 Question:People with low self-confidence are compared to leaves because they  _  . 
A. don't have the power to face their lives 
B. are ready to change their minds 
C. can't exercise control over themselves 
D. are easily affected by windy weather 
 Answer: C

""Young man ,""she persisted, ""I know Judge Lawson and State Senator   Patton."" Handing the ticket to the woman, the officer asked pleasantly, ""Tell me, do you know Bill Bronson.""
""Why, no,""She answered. ""Well, that is the man you should have known,""he said, heading back to his motorcycle, ""I am Bill Bronson.""

Context: Is it possible to persuade mankind to live without war? War is an ancient custom which has existed for at least six thousand years. It was always evil and usually foolish, but in the past the human race managed to live with it. Modern skill has changed this. Either man will stop war, or war will stop man. For the present, it is nuclear weapons that cause the greatest danger, but bacteriological(  ) or chemical weapons may, before long, offer an even greater threat. If we succeeded in stopping war, there would be no danger for us. To do this, we need to persuade mankind to look upon international questions in a new way, not by contests of force, in which the victory goes to the side which is most skillful in massacre ( ),but by judging in accordance with agreed rules of law. It is not easy to change old mental habits, but this is what must be attempted.
There are those who say that the adoption of this or that ideology  would prevent war. I believe this to be a complete error. All ideologies are based upon beliefs without proof which are, at best, doubtful, and at worst, totally false. Those people who believe them are willing to go to war in support of them.
The movement of world opinion during the past two years has changed very largely such as we can welcome. It has become a common belief that nuclear war must be avoided. Of course, very difficult problems remain in the international world, but the spirit in which they are being approached is a better one than it was some years ago. It has begun to be thought, even by the powerful men who decide whether we shall live or die, that agreements should be reached even if both sides do not find these agreements wholly satisfactory. It has begun to be understood that the important conflict nowadays is not between East and West, but between Man and the bomb. 
 Question:The author believes that the only way to stop war is to  _  . 
A. take possession of stronger weapons 
B. let the stronger side take over the world 
C. settle international issues through agreements 
D. destroy bacteriological and chemical weapons 
 Answer: C
Context: Barack Obama has never been shy about comparing himself with Abraham Lincoln. He did so when he announced his presidential election in Illinois, where both he and Lincoln served in the legislature  . ""The life of a tall, thin, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible."" Obama said. ""He tells us that there is power in words and that there is power in hope."" Such comparisons have continued on big and small occasions, but the most important similarity, in Obama's mind, is how he plans to govern if elected.
Obama says he admires Doris Kearns Goodwin' s wonderful Lincoln biography, Team of Rivals. ""He talks about it all the time."" says a top assistant. ""He is particularly interested in the idea that Lincoln successfully won the hearts of many people who had run against him for President, some of them even disagree with him firmly."" ""The lesson is that you shouldn't let your hatred   get in the way of hiring  ly the best people."" says Obama. ""I think American people are practical and so I have an interest in casting a wide net, seeking out people with a wide range of expert knowledge, including Republicans, for the highest positions in the government.""
""I don't want to have people who just agree with me."" He says. ""I want people who are continually pushing me forward and I'd be very interested in having those sorts of Republicans in my government, especially people who can speed up a responsible and logical conclusion to the Iraq war."" 
 Question:What can we infer from the passage? 
A. Obama is a member of the Republicans. 
B. The passage was written after the presidential election. 
C. Doris Goodwin is one of Obama's assistants. 
D. In the end Lincoln was able to get the support of the people who once hated him.

Context: Here is a question I have often asked at dinner parties:
You're on an island with only one other person, your best friend. He's dying of cancer. In his final days, he tells you, ""I have 100,000 dollars in a bank back home. When I die, make sure my son goes to medical school."" Then he dies. But his son is a no-good playboy who has no interest in going to medical school and will waste that money away in a very short time. But your son is entering college, and he is willing to become a doctor. Which one do you give the money to for medical school?
I've asked this question of everyone from the president of a famous university to an ordinary young soldier, and it has never failed to get a discussion going. Everyone has an opinion, most of them different, but all of them correct. Sometimes this one topic lasts the whole evening.

Context: Our listener question this week comes from Abdullahi Farah, who wants to know about the life and work of Doctor Benjamin Carson.
Doctor Carson is an internationally recognized doctor at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. He has been the director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at the hospital for twenty-five years. At the age of thirty-three, he became one of the youngest doctors in the United States to hold that position. And he was the first African-American to have that position at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
Ben Carson is known for his work as a brain surgeon for children. For example, in nineteen eighty-seven, he led a team of seventy doctors and nurses in an operation to separate two babies joined at the head. Earlier attempts by other
on other babies had failed. Doctor Carson successfully performed the operation. Both babies were able to survive independently.
Doctor Carson has written four books. His first book, ""Gifted Hands,"" tells the story of his life. Benjamin Carson was born in nineteen fifty-one in Detroit, Michigan.
As a boy, Ben was not a good student. In fact, he was the worst in his class. When his mother learned of his failing grades she asked her sons to read two library books every week. She limited the amount of time they watched television. And she told them to respect every person.
Ben Carson soon became the top student in his class. He went on to study at Yale University, one of the best universities in the country, and later to medical school at the University of Michigan.
Doctor Carson has received many awards and honors. Last year he received the nation's highest civilian honor. Former President George W. Bush presented Benjamin Carson with the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a ceremony at the White House.

Context: Whenever the word ""hero"" comes to me, I immediately think of three Hs: honorable, hardworking, and happy. When I think more about this word, I picture someone who has accomplished good things for people and tries to do the right thing Hattie Elizabeth Alexander is one person whom I find to be very heroic.
Hattie was born in Baltimore, Maryland on April 5, 1901. During her time at College she earned her Bachelor's Degree in Bacteriology and Physiology. These were just the first steps towards what she was finally going to be remembered for. After college Hattie attended Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and received her medical degree.
After her education, she pursued her career, and after much time and hard work, she _ reduced the number of infants  dying from meningitis . Hattie was very dedicated to her work and helped at as many locations as she could. Spending substantial  time in the laboratory, Hattie successfully developed a cure against the disease, which decreased the death rate to 20 percent. At the same time, she was also a teacher working with Columbia University.
She was a caring lady interested in other people's lives. When she was teaching at Columbia University, other members would talk to her about students that were failing their classes, and somehow Hattie could always find convincing reasons as to why they should not be driven away. Later, Hattie became an instructor in Pediatrics at New York City's Babies Hospital. After many honors, she became the first woman president of the American Pediatric Society in 1965. This was her last major achievement, for soon after, Hattie died of cancer on June 24, 1968.
Hattie is my hero because her positive attitude and strength helped her accomplish great things for others. She gave them her strength by developing medicines against diseased, which, by doing so, made them stronger. This is what makes Hattie Elizabeth Alexander my hero.

Context: Anxiety is the appropriate emotion when the immediate personal terror--of a volcano, an arrow, a stab in the back and other disasters, all directed against one's self--disappears.
The kind of world that produces anxiety is actually a world of   safety, a world in which no one feels that he himself is facing sudden death. The anxiety exists as an uneasy state of mind, in which one has a feeling that something unspecified and indeterminable may go wrong. If the world seems to be going well, this produces anxiety--for good times may end.If the world is going badly--it may get worse. Anxiety tends to be without focus; the anxious person doesn't know whether to blame himself or other people. He isn't sure whether it is the current year of the administration or a change in climate or the atom bomb that is to blame for this undefined sense of unease.
It is clear that we have developed a society which depends on having the right amount of anxiety to make it work...While we agree that too much anxiety is harmful to mental health, we have come to rely on anxiety to push us into seeing a doctor about a symptom which may indicate cancer, into checking up on that old life-insurance policy which may have out-of-date provisions in it, into having a conference with Billy's teacher even though his report card looks all right.
People who are anxious enough keep their car insurance up, have the brakes checked, don't take a second drink when they have to drive. People who are too anxious either refuse to go into cars at all--and so complicate the ordinary course of life--or drive so tensely and carefully that they help cause accidents. People who aren't anxious enough take chance after chance, which increases the terrible accidents of the roads. 
 Question:According to the author, accidents of the road tend to be caused by_. 
A. all those who are too anxious 
B. all those who have anxiety 
C. those who have no anxiety 
D. those who are not anxious enough 
 Answer: D
Context: In a cab, a woman seemed in such a hurry. She constantly rushed the cab driver to drive quickly. She was so absorbed in her own thoughts of getting to the airport as soon as possible that she was not aware they were going by a different route.
All of a sudden, a young man got inside the cab. He took her handbag in which she had put her visa, passport, and all the money for the trip.
The cab driver, who was _ the robber, left her in the exactly middle of a dark street. She thought that she was rather unfortunate in the very situation.
During the very night, she was told a piece of shocking news. Tears came down her cheek. Flight 360, the plane that she should have got on board, had crashed. Had she not lost her important belongings, she could surely have lost the thing far more precious----her life.
Sometimes bad things really happen. There are times when nothing seems to go our way. So what should we do about it? We must get rid of all these frustrations and start all over again in the faith that we will get what we deserve.
Don't waste your time and energy on things that can't be changed. Continuous worrying will only affect your health and you'll be doing much more damage than what was previously done.
What if it was the other way round? What if we never ran out of good luck?
There was a man who won the lottery. He became greedy and wasted all his money on everything he could get his hands on.
But when he one day made it to the front page of the newspaper again, it was a different story. He had been killed because of his riches. If you attain good luck, you can never be too secure about it. Life is so unpredictable. You never know what will happen next.
Live one day at a time. We sometimes subject ourselves to unnecessary emotional trouble. But please don't forget: sometimes misfortune can be the source of happiness. Live for the moment. Do what must be done for the present and the future will turn out just fine. Believe me. And believe in yourself. As Captain Planet always says, ""The power is yours!"" 
 Question:From the passage, we learn that   _  . 
A. robbers are sure to get what they want 
B. somebody never runs out of good luck 
C. the woman was lucky to miss her flight 
D. if one feels oneself lucky, he or she will continue to be so 
 Answer: C
Context: There was a robbery at City Central Bank last yesterday afternoon. Two men entered the bank at about 4 p.m. and told the bank teller on duty to give them $ 1,000,000.

 Answer: D
Context: When we think of leadership, we often think of strength and power. But what are these really, and how do they operate?
Leadership today is not about forcing others to do things. If this is even possible, it is short-term, and tends to backfire. If you order someone to do something against their will, they may do it because they feel they must, but the anger they feel will do more harm in the long-term, They will also experience fear.
Fear causes the thinking brain to shut down, making the person unable to function at his or her best. If they associate you with this emotion of fear. They will become less functional around you, and you will have succeeded in not only shooting yourself in the foot, but possibly making a very good employee or partner unable to perform effectively. Fear has no place in leadership.
The way we influence people in a lasting way is by our own character, and our understanding and use of emotion. We can order someone to do something, which may be part of the work day; or we can employ them at the emotional level, so they became fully devoted to the projects and provide some of their own motivation  . Today's work place is all about relationships.
Anyone works harder in a positive environment in which they are recognized and valued as a human being as well as a worker. Everyone produces just a bit more for someone they like. Leaders understand the way things work. They know the pay check is not the single most motivating factor   in the work life of most people.
The true strength of leadership is an inner strength that comes from the confidence of emotional intelligence--knowing your own emotions, and how to handle them, and those of others. Developing your emotional intelligence is the single best thing you can do if you want to develop your relationships with people around you, which is the key to the leadership skills. 
 Question:An employee may have a feeling of fear in the work place when   _  . 
A. he is forced to do thing 
B. he cannot work at his best 
C. he feels his brain shut down 
D. he thinks of his work as too heavy

Context: We are all called upon to make a speech at some point in life, but most of us don't do a very good job. This article gives some suggestions on how to give an effective speech.
So, you have to give a speech and you're fearful. You get nervous, you forget what you want to say, you stumble over  words, you talk too long and you bore your audience. Later you think,"" Thank goodness, it's over. I'm just no good at public speaking. I hope I never have to do that again.""
Cheer up! It doesn't have to be that bad. Here are some simple steps to take the pain out of speech making. Ask yourself the purpose of your speech. What is the occasion ? Why are you speaking? Then, gather as many facts as you can on your subject. Spend plenty of time doing your research. Then spend plenty of time organizing your material so that your speech is clear and easy to follow. Use as many examples as possible and use pictures, charts and graphs if they will help you make your points more clearly. Never forget your audience. Don't talk over their heads so that they can understand what you say. They will appreciate your thoughtfulness.
Just remember: Be prepared. Know your subject, your audience and the occasion. Be brief. Say what you have to say and then stop. And be yourself. Let your personality come through so that you make person-to-person contact with your audience.
If you follow these simple steps, you'll see that you don't have to be afraid of public speaking. In fact, you may find the experience so enjoyable that you volunteer to make more speeches! You're not sure yet. Give it a try and see what happens. 
 Question:The main idea of the passage is that   _    . 
A. a poor speaker can never change 
B. it's easy to make a short speech 
C. you need to respect your audience 
D. how you can improve your speaking ability

Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""
It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on. 
 Question:What can we learn from this passage? 
A. Jordan is not such a great person. 
B. Jordan deserves the admiration he had from others. 
C. Jordan is always ready to make friends with young people. 
D. Jordan is always misunderstood by expert reviewers.

Context: My teachers suggested that I see a speech specialist   in school.
I never really gave much thought to my speech. If other people understood what I was saying, then that was good enough. I didn't mind repeating myself many times.
Before testing me, the speech specialist asked me what I thought of having good speech. I told her I thought it was not important.
""Well, when you are in an interview for a job, and they don't know what you are saying, what are they going to say to you? Nice meeting you, bye,"" she said.
Maybe good speech was important. I took part in 20-minute classes each week with the specialist.
After she tested me, she told me that I spoke too fast, and didn't give enough eye contact  . I learned that when I made eye contact with someone, it meant that I was talking to that person, and I could also see what he or she thought about what I was saying.
When my first speech class started, I found that I had been speaking too fast to be understood. Every time I spoke too fast, the specialist stopped me and told me to start again. At first, I got stopped after almost every other sentence. After a while, I felt my speech slow down. I wasn't sure if people could understand me better, but my friends stopped asking me to repeat myself.
Speech is an important skill to have. If you do have good speech, that's a good thing, but if you don't have it, it is never too late to improve. 
 Question:From the sentence ""but my friends stopped asking me to repeat myself,"" we know that   _  . 
A. the writer's friends couldn't understand him 
B. the writer still couldn't make eye contact 
C. the writer improved a lot 
D. the writer didn't slow down

Context: After eleven years of marriage, a couple had a boy. They were a loving couple and the boy was a gem of their eyes.
When the boy was around two years old, one morning the husband saw a medicine bottle open. He was late for work, so he asked his wife to cap the bottle and keep it in the cupboard. His wife who was busy in the kitchen forgot the matter.
The boy saw the bottle, playfully went to it, was fascinated by its color and drank it all. It happened to be a poisonous  medicine. When the child fell to the ground, the mother took him to the hospital in a hurry, where he died. The mother was stunned. She was terrified at how to face her husband.
When the father came to the hospital and saw the dead child, he looked at his wife and just said, ""I'm with you, darling.""
The child is dead. He can never be brought back to life. There is no point in finding fault with the mother. Besides, if only he had taken time to keep the bottle away, this would not have happened. No one is to blame . She had also lost her only child. What she needed at that moment was consolation  and sympathy  from the husband. That is exactly what he gave her. 
 Question:How did the boy die? 
A. He fell downstairs by accident. 
B. He took some poisonous medicine by accident. 
C. He had a heart disease. 
D. He ate too much candy. 
 Answer: B
Context: In the famous fairy tale, Snow White eats the Queen's apple and falls victim to a curse; in Shakespeare's novel, Romeo drinks the poison and dies; some ancient Chinese kings took pills that contained mercury, believing that it would make them _ , but they died afterwards.
Poison has long been an important part in literature and history, and it seems to always be about evil, danger and death. But how much do you really know about poison?
An exhibition, The Power of Poison, opened last month at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, intended to give the audience a more vivid understanding of poison. The exhibition will continue until Feb. 2016, reported The New York Times.
The museum tour starts in a rainforest setting, where you can see live examples of some of the most poisonous animals: caterpillars, frogs and spiders. Golden poison frogs, for instance, aren't much bigger than a coin, but their skin is covered in a poison that can cut off the signaling power of your nerves, and a single frog has enough venom to kill 10 grown humans.
The exhibition also features interactive activities. In an iPad-based game, visitors are presented with three puzzling illnesses and asked to identify the poisons based on symptoms. In one case, for example, a pet dog is found sick in a backyard and visitors have to figure out whether it was the toad  , the leaky batteries in the trash or the dirty pond water that did it.
""Poisons can be bad for some things,"" Michael Novacek, senior vice president of the museum, told NBC News. ""Yet they can also be good for others.""
This is what visitors learn from the last part of the exhibition, which displays how poisons can be used favorably by humans, including for medical treatment.
The blood toxins of vampire bats, for example, can prevent blood from clotting  , which may protect against strokes. A poisonous chemical found in the yew tree is effective against cancer, which is what led to the invention of a cancer-fighting drug called Taxol. One chemical in the venom of Gila monsters can lower the blood sugar of its victims, so it has been used to treat diabetes. 
 Question:What is the main purpose of the exhibition The Power of Poison? 
A. To give people more knowledge about poison. 
B. To teach people how to handle poisonous animals. 
C. To inform people about which animals are the most poisonous. 
D. To show how poison has been used for medical treatment. 
 Answer: A
Context: Doctors in hospital emergency rooms often see accidental poisonings . A frightened parent arrives with a child who swallowed a cleaning liquid. Or perhaps the harmful substance is a medicine. Or it might be a chemical product meant to kill insects. These are common causes of accidental poisoning.
In cases like this, look for medical help as soon as possible. Save the container of whatever caused the poisoning. And look on the container for information about anything that stops the effects of the poison. Save anything expelled   from the mouth of the victim. That way, doctors can examine it.
In the past, some people forced poisoning victims to empty the stomach. They used a liquid syrup of ipecac   to do this. But an organization of children's doctors no longer advises parents to keep syrup of ipecac. The American Academy of Pediatrics says some poisons can cause additional damage when they come back up the throat.
Millions of people know a way to save a person who is choking on something trapped in the throat. The method is commonly known as the Heimlich Maneuver or abdominal thrusts. The American Red Cross says a rescuer should first hit the person on the back five times between the shoulder bones. These back blows may ease the choking. If the airway is still blocked, the Red Cross suggests pushing hard five times along the victim's abdomen. The abdomen is the area between the chest and the hip   bones.

A. Learning the basics of first aid

Context: Donald was shaken by thunder on the bed before he could count ""one thousand one"". Then he heard the smoke alarm go off. He went downstairs quickly to investigate. When he opened the door to the basement  , flames exploded out.
Donald fled   back upstairs to call 911 but the phone didn't work. When he tried to go downstairs, he was stopped by a wall of flames. He had to use a towel to cover his mouth. His house was three miles off the main road and so well hidden by trees that Donald knew calling for help would be useless. Actually, he didn't even try to do that.
About one mile away lived Donald's closest neighbor, Jeremie. When he heard some sounds, Jeremie jumped out of bed, holding a phone and a flashlight, and went towards the noise.

Context: Many cities in the world are benefiting from the night activities of a group of people who call themselves guerrilla   gardeners. Armed with trowels, spades and a van full of flowers and plants, guerrilla gardeners turn abandoned urban land into a blaze of color. In city centre locations where there was mud, weeds and empty plastic bottles, residents often wake up to find that the wasted area has been transformed overnight with brightly-colored bedding plants.
In most British cities, local governments and police turn a blind eye to the effort of the gardeners, whose activities are always carried out under cover of nightfall. And so far, there has been nothing but praise from the astonished and delighted local residents when they find their neighborhood transformed in such a striking fashion.
Not only do the guerrilla gardeners beautify neglected places, they also return regularly to water the plants and weed the flower beds. They also make sure that at least some of the plants they bring are evergreens, which means that the area doesn't look depressing in the winter months.
The first guerrilla gardener in London was Richard Reynolds, whose day job is at an advertising agency. Mr. Reynolds, a graduate of Oxford University, began his efforts two years ago when he moved to a flat in a tower block in South London. From his balcony, he could see several empty concrete pots, placed by the local governments to contain plants but never used. He went out after midnight and filled the pots with plants, and then planted more flowers in the path leading to the entrance to the block.
He then set up a website to explain his plan and called upon more gardeners to join him. Cash donations flooded in and, more importantly, volunteers rushed to be part of the campaign. Within six months, there were five hundred people in London prepared to come out at very short notice to restore neglected parts of the urban landscape. There are now unofficial but carefully-organized groups in many cities in Britain and North America and there is also a website where would-be urban gardeners can find out the location of the next expedition. 
 Question:Richard Reynolds decided to fill the pots with plants in order to   _  . 
A. plant more flowers in the path 
B. beautify the neighborhood 
C. attract attention for his ad agency 
D. make the plants a feast for his eyes

Julie's going to pick her up from school as usual on Friday but she's not taking her home. She's bringing her to the Palace Hotel, the big modern one near the station. We're having a meal there and we've also hired   the ballroom   for a party in the evening. I hope you can come!
All her friends from school are coming and quite a few of the people from our village, too. Of course, Mum and Dad are coming up from England and I've managed to persuade   our other sister, Marie, to come over from Australia. She's bringing her kids with her, too.
After the party we're going to have another one on Saturday! Well, not really a party. We're inviting the family and close friends (that includes you) for a meal at the house. If the weather is nice, we'd like to have a barbecue in the garden. Julie's going to make a special cake for Suzie.
Anyway, we hope to make it a really special weekend for Suzie. On Sunday we're all going for a walk in the country. You know how she loves walking and we're all going to need a bit of exercise after all that lovely food. We're hoping to go up to the lake. Marie said she wanted her kids to feed the ducks just like Suzie and she did when they were very young. I'm sure Suzie will love that too.
It would be great if you could come over for the weekend. We would all love to see you.
Let me know as soon as you can.
Best,
David

Context: Dear Jenny,
Gary is having a _ party after Month Exam! He invites all of us to come! Since it is a potluck party, I think I will bring some beef noodles. As I know, Lily will take care of the drinks and Gina will bring a big homemade chocolate cake. Can you ask your mom to buy us some KFC fried chicken? You know it is too far for all of us to ride a bike there, but your mom often drives there. We can pay the bill together. Just think about how surprised our classmates will feel when they see what we prepare! Isn't it great?
The party will start at noon on March 25, so be sure to be at Gary's place around 11:30 to prepare for the party. By the way, don't forget to invite Amy, who is good at music. If you have any other questions, just call me or write me back.
Take care!

Mr. Harris said he did not want to quarrel with the policeman, so everyone went home. They were sorry to have to go.

Context: A few years ago a group of salesmen went to a meeting in Chicago. They had assured their wives that they would be home in plenty of time for Friday night's dinner. In their rush, with tickets, one of these salesmen happened to kick over a table which held a display of baskets of apples. Apples flew everywhere. Without stopping or looking back, they all managed to reach the plane in time for their boarding.
All but one stopped, took a deep breath and experienced a twinge of sorrow for the girl whose apple stand had been overturned. He told his friends to go on without him, waved goodbye, and told one of them to call his wife when they arrived and explain his taking a later flight. Then he returned to where the apple stand had been overturned. He was glad he did.
The 16-year-old girl was totally blind! She was softly crying, tears running down her face. The salesman knelt on the floor with her, gathered up the apples, put them into the baskets, and helped set the display up once more. As he did this, he noticed that many of them had become damaged; then he set them aside in another basket. When he had finished, he pulled out his wallet and said to the girl, ""Here, please take the $20 for the damage we did."" He continued, ""I'm sorry for what we did and hope we didn't spoil your day too badly.""

Context: It's just a small, white envelope stuck among the branches of our Christmas tree. No name, no address. It has peeked through the branches of our tree for the past 10 years.
It all began because my husband Mike hated Christmas. He didn't hate the true meaning of Christmas, but the commercial aspects of it; overspending, running around at the last minute to get a tie for Uncle Harry and powder for Grandma...
Knowing he felt this way, I decided one year to bypass the usual shirts, sweaters, ties and so forth. I reached for something special for Mike. The inspiration came in an unusual way.
Our son Kevin, at 12 that year, was wrestling at the junior level at the school he attended and before Christmas, there was a non-league match against a team sponsored by an inner-city church, mostly black.
As the match began, I was alarmed to see that the other team was wrestling without headgear to protect a wrestler's ears. They obviously could not afford.
Mike shook his head sadly, ""I wish just one of them could have won,"" he said. ""They have a lot of potential, but losing like this could _ .""
Mike loved kids--all kids--and he knew them, having coached little league football, baseball and lacrosse. That's when the idea for his present came.
That afternoon, I went to a local sporting goods store and bought an assortment of wrestling headgear and shoes and sent them anonymously to the inner-city church.
On Christmas Eve, I placed the envelope on the tree, the note inside telling Mike what I had done and that this was his gift from me. His smile was the brightest thing about Christmas that year. For each Christmas, I followed the tradition.
The envelope became the highlight of our Christmas. It was always the last thing opened on Christmas morning and our children, ignoring their new toys, would stand with wide-eyed anticipation as their dad lifted the envelope from the tree to reveal its contents.
The tradition has grown and someday will expand even further with our grandchildren standing around the tree with wide-eyed anticipation watching as their fathers take down the envelope. Mike's spirit, like the Christmas spirit, will always be with us. 
 Question:What can we infer from the passage? 
A. The tradition of sending presents will pass from generation to generation. 
B. The children were eager to get their new toys ignoring the envelope. 
C. With the presents, the poor kids will surely win the match one day. 
D. Mike's spirit, like the Christmas spirit, will always be with us.

Context: ""But what if I break my arm again?"" my 5-year-old daughter asked. I knew how much she wanted to learn to ride. Yet ever since she'd fallen off her bike and broken her arm, she'd been afraid.
""Oh honey,"" I said. ""I don't think you'll break another arm.""
""But I could, couldn't I?""
""Yes,"" I admitted, and found myself struggling for the right thing to say. ""I don't think I want to ride,"" she said and got off her bike.
We walked away and sat down beside a tree.
""Don't you want to ride with your friends?"" I asked. ""And I thought you were hoping to start riding your bike to school next year,"" I added.
""I was,"" she said in a low voice.
""You know, honey,"" I said. ""Most everything you do comes with dangers. You could break your arm at gymnastics. Do you want to stop going to the gym?"" ""No, of course not!"" she replied. And with a determined spirit, she stood up and agreed to try again. I held on to the back of her bike until she found the courage to say, ""Let's go!""
I spent the rest of the afternoon at the park watching a very brave little girl overcome a fear, and congratulating myself for being an independent single parent.
As we walked home, pushing the bike as we made our way along the sidewalk, she asked me about a conversation she'd overheard me having with my mother the night before.
""Why were you and Grandma arguing last night?""
""It's nothing."" I told her.
She shrugged  . ""Grandma said she just wanted you to find someone to love.""
""What Grandma wants is for some guy to break my heart again,"" I snapped.
""But Mom ...""
""You're too young to understand."" I told her.
She was quiet for the next few minutes. Then she looked up and in a small voice said, ""So I guess love isn't like a broken arm.""
Unable to answer, we walked the rest of the way in silence. When I got home, I let go and agreed to meet a man called Steve.
Steve was the man for me. We married less than a year later. It turned out my mother and my daughter were right. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE? 
A. The author didn't get along well with her mother. 
B. The author's daughter believed love isn't like a broken arm. 
C. The author's daughter tried to stop her mom from going to meet Steve. 
D. The author came to understand her own fear with the help of her daughter.

Context: One girl decided to study judo  although she had lost her left arm in a car accident.
The girl began lessons with an old Japanese judo instructor. The girl was doing well. So she couldn't understand why, after three months of training, the instructor had taught her only one move.
""Instructor,"" the girl finally said, ""Shouldn't I be learning more moves?""
""This is the only move you know, but this is the only move you'll ever need to know,"" the instructor replied.
Not quite understanding, but believing in her teacher, the girl kept training.
Several months later, the instructor took the girl to her first tournament. Surprising herself, the girl easily won her first two matches. The third match proved to be more difficult, but after some time, her opponent became impatient and charged. The girl skillfully used her one move to win the match. Still amazed by her success, the girl was now in the finals.
This time, her opponent was bigger, stronger and more experienced. For a while, the girl appeared to be _ . Concerned that the girl might get hurt, the referee called a time-out. She was about to stop the match when the instructor intervened .
""No,"" the instructor insisted, ""Let her continue.""
Soon after the match restarted, her opponent made a serious mistake: she dropped her guard. Instantly, the girl used her move to pin her opponent. The girl had won the match and the tournament. She was the champion.
On the way home, the girl and her teacher reviewed every move in each and every match. Then the girl gathered the courage to ask what was really on her mind.
""Instructor, how did I win the tournament with only one move?""
""You won for two reasons,"" the teacher answered. ""First, you've almost mastered one of the most difficult throws in all of judo. Second, the only known defense for that move is for your opponent to grab your left arm.""
The girl's biggest weakness had become her biggest strength. 
 Question:What can we learn about the girl? 
A. She was disabled in an accident. 
B. She disliked judo training. 
C. She learnt several moves. 
D. She won the first two matches hard.

By the end of the day and I were exhausted. Shari didn't seem tired. That was what  Shari liked doing especially when she gave someone else something. I'd seen her give away berries to everybody--parking attendants, mail carriers, hairdressers. ""For me?"" they'd say, breaking into a smile.

Context: Providing a highquality education for all children is important to America's economic future.President Obama has decided to provide every child with access to a complete and competitive education,from cradle  through career.
The years before a child reaches kindergarten are among the most _ in his or her life to influence learning.The President will urge states to introduce high standards across all publicly funded early learning settings,develop new programs to improve opportunities and outcomes,engage parents in their child's early learning and development,and improve the early education workforce.
President Obama will reform America's public schools to deliver a 21st century education that will prepare all children for success in the new global workplace.He will push to end the use of ineffective,""offtheshelf"" tests,and support new,stateoftheart assessment and responsibility systems that provide timely and useful information about the learning and progress of students.
Teachers are the single most important resource to children's learning.President Obama will invest in a national effort to reward outstanding teachers,while enlisting the best and brightest in the field of teaching.And he will challenge State and school districts to remove ineffective teachers from the classroom.
The President believes that investment in education must be accompanied by reform and innovation  .He supports the expansion of highquality charter schools  .He has challenged States to lift limits that stop growth among successful charter schools and has encouraged strict responsibility for all charter schools.
President Obama has decided to ensure that America will regain its lost ground and have the highest proportion of students graduating from college in the world by 2020.The President believes that regardless of educational path after high school,all Americans should enroll in at least one year of higher education or job training to better prepare our workforce for the 21st century economy.
To reach these goals,the President has decided to increase higher education access and success by restructuring and greatly expanding college financial aid,while making federal programs simpler,more reliable,and more efficient for students. 
 Question:Which of the following things is NOT part of President Obama's decision? 
A. Remove ineffective teachers from the classroom. 
B. Reform America's public schools. 
C. Enlist some teachers from other countries. 
D. Expand highquality charter schools. 
 Answer: C
Context: Pushy parents and teachers who ""hothouse"" the under-5s risk causing damage to the children's long term development, a leading education expert said.
Lilian Katz, Professor of Education at the University of Illinois, said that four-year-olds engaged in reading and writing went on to perform worse academically than those engaged in imaginative learning. They scored higher in tests at the age of 5, but children whose first year at school was stimulating _ them four years later.
The findings suggest that the government's structured approach to early years' learning could be storing up problems for children. They also raise serious questions about the plan for all children to be able to read by the age of 6.
In many countries formal teaching does not start until children are 6 or 7 and have improved their social and manual skills. Children start learning to read and write at 6 in the United States, France and Germany, and at 7 in Finland and Sweden.
Professor Katz said that in many schools the courses were ""boring children to tears"". Much academic teaching required children to learn by memorizing pieces of information out of context, she said. Teaching in reception class should instead allow children to develop their intellect by exploring their environments and asking questions.
""Research suggests the benefits of formal academic instruction for four- and five-year-olds seem to be promising when they are tested early, but considerably less so in the long term. When these children are followed over a period of three or more years, those who had early experience in more intellectually engaging curricula were more likely to do well in school than their peers, who had received early academic instruction."" She advocates teaching children through first-hand experience and play, in mixed-aged classes. This can include puppet shows, drawing or running a pretend shop in the classroom. 
 Question:According to Lilian Katz, the government's structured approach to early-years learning   _  . 
A. is necessary for improving children's reading and writing ability 
B. needs to be improved to develop children's academic ability 
C. will cause problems to children in their future learning 
D. has more advantages than disadvantages

In Hollywood, many TV shows are made. About forty teachers give lessons to the children in the shows. They teach wherever their pupils are working. The teachers' job is very important. They are responsible  for making sure that the children work only the permitted  hours each week. They are also responsible for making sure that children learn the required subjects. They make sure, too, that the children get enough rest and play, along with their education.
Children actors are required to attend classes twenty hours each week. California law says they must be taught from September to June. If they do not make much progress in school, they are not permitted to continue working in TV shows. TV children are usually good pupils, and most of their teachers like this special kind of work. Their classes are held in some wonderful places. Sometimes the ""classroom"" is a Mississippi riverboat, and sometimes it is the inside of a spaceship. Often the pupils become famous TV or movie stars.

Context: A little boy went to a farmer who had some puppies  to sell and said, ""I want to buy one of your puppies."" Then reaching deep into his pocket, he pulled out a handful of change and held it up to the farmer. ""I've got thirty-nine cents. Is that enough to take a look.""
""Sure,"" said the farmer. Then he called his dog, ""Here, Dolly!""
Out from the doghouse and down the ramp  ran Dolly followed by four little balls of fur. The little boy pressed his face against the chain link fence. His eyes danced with delight.
As the dogs made their way to the fence, the little boy noticed something else moving inside the doghouse. Slowly, another little ball appeared. This one was much smaller than the others. Down the ramp it slid . Then in a somewhat awkward manner the little pup began hobbling  toward the others, doing its best to catch up...
""I want that one,"" the little boy said, pointing to the slow dog.
The farmer knelt down at the boy's side and said, ""Son, you don't want that puppy. He will never be able to run and play with you like these other dogs will.""

Context: The drug store was closing for the night. Young Alfred Higgins, the shop-assistant, was ready to go home. Mr. Carr, the boss, stared at him and said: ""Stop! Alfred. Maybe you'd be good enough to take the things out of your pockets and leave them here before you go."" Alfred's face got red. After a little hesitation , he took out what he had stolen. Mr. Carr said, ""Maybe I should call you mother and let her know I'm going to have to put you in prison.""
Alfred thought his mother would come rushing in, eyes burning with anger. But, to his surprise, she arrived wearing a smile. ""Hello, I'm Alfred's mother. Is he in trouble?"" she said. Mr. Carr was surprised, too. He had expected Alfred's mother to come in nervously, shaking with fear, asking with wet eyes for a mercy   for her son. Yet, she was most calm, quiet, and pleasant, which made Mr. Carr feel guilty  . Soon Mr. Carr was shaking his head in agreement with what she was saying. ""Of course"", he said, ""I don't want to be cruel. You are right. Sometimes, a little good advice is the best thing for a boy at certain times in his life and it often takes the youth a long time to grow up."" And he warmly shook Mrs. Higgins's hand. 
Back home, without even looking at Alfred, she said, ""You are a burden. Your trouble came one after another, always! Why do you stand there so stupidly? Go to bed."" In his bedroom, Alfred heard his mother in the kitchen. Getting to the kitchen, he saw his mother drinking a cup of tea. His mother's face was a frightened, broken one, totally different from the earlier cool, bright face. She lifted the tea cup, her hands shaking, the lips moving nervously. 
He watched his mother quietly, without making a sound. The picture of his mother nearly made him cry. Realizing all the troubles he brought his mother in her shaking hands and the deep lines of worry in her grey face, he felt he shouldn't have done such a shameful theft to hurt his mother so deeply. He determined to grow up like a true man and protect his mother rather than hurt her again. 
 Question:The reason why Mr. Carr felt guilty was that   _  . 
A. Alfred's mother appeared polite and gentle 
B. he should have called a policeman at first 
C. he found Alfred was in fact not wrong 
D. he thought he was partly responsible for it

Context: The prisoner had waited many months for help, but none had come. Now he felt he would do something to gain his freedom, to be free again to go about the world as he wished. But he could think of no way to run away.
He spent many hours thinking of his life before he was captured, regretting the mistakes he had made and dreaming of the joys he had known. And over and over he said to himself that he was being punished for no reason. He was guilty of no crime, but he had not been given a chance to explain the events which made him guilty.
Then one night the guard who sat outside the prisoner's door fell asleep. When he noticed this, the prisoner was struck by a feeling of hope. Perhaps he could steal the keys while the guard was sleeping.
Silently the prisoner moved toward the guard. Very gently he lifted the ring of keys from the guard's belt. Then he turned and crawled toward the door. Could he work the lock from the inside? The key turned and the door was opened. Within two minutes he had crossed the yard and climbed the wall. Then he ran across the field, free at last, a smile of joy beginning to spread across his face. 
 Question:The prisoner had a wish  _  . 
A. to be excused 
B. to go away freely with his family 
C. to be a free man in the prison 
D. to be helped out of the prison 
 Answer: D
Context: The drug store was closing for the night and Alfred Higgins was about to go home when his new boss approached him.
""Empty your pockets please, Alfred,"" Sam Carr demanded in a firm voice.
Alfred pretended to be shocked but he knew he had been caught. From his coat he withdrew a make-up kit, a lipstick and two tubes of toothpaste.
""I'm disappointed in you, Alfred!"" said the little gray-haired man.
""Sorry, sir. Please forgive me. It's the first time I've ever done such a thing,"" Alfred lied, hoping to gain the old man's sympathy.
Mr Carr's brow furrowed as he reached for the telephone, ""Do you take me for a fool? Let's see what the police have to say. But first I'll call your mother and let her know her son is heading to jail.""
""Do whatever you want,"" Alfred shot back, trying to sound big. But deep down he felt like a child. He imagined his mother rushing in, eyes burning with anger, maybe in tears. Yet he wanted to come quickly before Mr. Carr called the police.
Mr. Carr was surprised when Mrs. Higgins finally arrived . She was very calm, quiet and friendly. ""Is Alfred in trouble?"" she asked.
""He's been stealing from the store,"" the old man coolly replied.
Mrs. Higgins pulled out her hand and touched Mr. Carr's arm with great gentleness as if she knew just how he felt. She spoke as if she did not want to cause him any more trouble. ""What do you want to do, Mr.Carr?""
The woman's calm and gentle manner _ the once-angry store-owner, ""I was going to get a cop. But I don't want to be cruel. Tell your son not to come back here again and I will let it go."" Then he warmly shook Mrs. Higgins' hand.
Mrs. Higgins thanked the old ma for his kindness, then mother and son left. They walked along the street in silence. When they arrived home his mother simply said, ""Go to bed, you fool.""
In his bedroom, Alfred heard his mother in the kitchen. He felt no shame, only pride in his mother's actions. ""She was smooth!"" he thought. He went to the kitchen to tell her how great she was, but was shocked by what he saw.
His mother's face looked frightened, broken. Not the cool, bright face he saw earlier. Her lips moved nervously. She looked very old. There were tears in her eyes.
This picture of his mother made him want to cry. He felt his youth ending. He saw all the troubles he brought her and the deep lines of worry in her grey face. It seemed to him that this was the first time he had ever really seen his mother. 
 Question:What was the mother's attitude towards Alfred? 
A. She felt disappointed with him. 
B. She was strict with him. 
C. She was supportive of him. 
D. She was afraid of him.

Context: Maxwell had not held a steady job in almost two years. Today was a big day, because he was going to a job interview that he felt good about. The secretary he had talked to on the phone sounded friendly and encouraging. 
Maxwell was a typist. His fingers danced on the keyboard. However, his people skills were not nearly as good as his typing skills. Sometimes his mouth got in the way of his employment. At his last steady job, his boss had told him to start making coffee every morning. Maxwell laughed. ""I'm not making coffee,"" he said. ""It's not part of my job description."" 
""Read the employee manual again,"" his boss said. ""Your job description is anything I say it is."" 
""That's a woman's job,"" said Maxwell. ""Do it yourself."" 
His boss was still yelling as Maxwell walked out of the building. He felt great about telling off the boss. A few days later, the reality of not having a job hit home. He had to pay the rent and utility bills, and he had to eat. What was he going to do? 
He thought about apologizing and asking for his job back. But how would that look? Then again, who cares how it looks when you're almost broke? After thinking about it for another week, he finally called his boss and apologized. His boss accepted his apology, but said that he had already hired a replacement. 
Maxwell contacted a temporary job agency, which provided him enough occasional work to pay his bills. But none of the companies that he was sent to were hiring. So Maxwell was excited about finally getting an interview for a steady job. 
Maxwell's drive to the interview was disappointing. The traffic was  _ and the neighborhood looked rough. It took him 45 minutes to get there. The building was covered with graffiti.  
The interview started 30 minutes late. Not bothering to apologize, the manager lit a cigarette and took a sip from his coffee cup. He leaned back in his chair and put his feet up on his desk. He asked Maxwell a lot of questions. Maxwell thought that each question was stupider than the preceding question. The final question was, ""Where would you like to be 10 years from now?"" 
What does that have to do with typing? Maxwell wondered. Stupid questions from a rude man in a lousy neighborhood! Where would he like to be 10 years from now? 
""Anywhere but this dump!"" Maxwell said angrily, as he stood up and walked out. 
 Question:According to the passage, which statement is right about the job interview? 
A. Maxwell was 30 minutes late. 
B. The manager got no manners in the interview. 
C. The interviewer asked a lot of silly questions except the last one. 
D. Maxwell misunderstood the interviewer's questions.

Maxwell's drive to the interview was disappointing. The traffic was  _ and the neighborhood looked rough. It took him 45 minutes to get there. The building was covered with graffiti.  
The interview started 30 minutes late. Not bothering to apologize, the manager lit a cigarette and took a sip from his coffee cup. He leaned back in his chair and put his feet up on his desk. He asked Maxwell a lot of questions. Maxwell thought that each question was stupider than the preceding question. The final question was, ""Where would you like to be 10 years from now?"" 
What does that have to do with typing? Maxwell wondered. Stupid questions from a rude man in a lousy neighborhood! Where would he like to be 10 years from now? 
""Anywhere but this dump!"" Maxwell said angrily, as he stood up and walked out. 
 Question:After the interview, we can infer that   _  . 
A. Maxwell will celebrate his big day. 
B. The manager will apologize to Maxwell. 
C. Maxwell will finally get this post. 
D. Maxwell will have to find another job interview.

Context: It was a quarter past nine as Marie hurried into the office building where she was going to work. Her bus had inched along through heavy morning traffic, making her a few minutes late for her very first job. She decided to start out half an hour earlier the next day  
Once inside the lobby, she had to stand at the elevators and wait several minutes before she could get on one going to the sixth floor. When she finally reached the office marked ""King Enterprises"", she knocked at the door nervously and waited. There was no answer. She tapped on the door again, but still, there was no reply. From inside the next office, she could hear the sound of voices, so she opened the door and went in. Although she was sure it was the same office she had been in two weeks before when she had had the interview with Mr King, it looked quite different now. In fact, it hardly looked like an office at all. The employees were just standing around chatting and smoking. At the far end of the room, somebody must have just told a good joke, she thought, because there was a loud burst of laughter as she came in. 
For a moment she had thought they were laughing at her. Then one of the men looked at his watch, clapped his hands and said something to the others. Quickly they all went to their desks and, in a matter of seconds, everyone was hard at work. No one paid any attention to Marie. 
Finally she went up to the man who was sitting at the desk nearest to the door and explained that this was her first day in the office. Hardly looking up from his work, he told her to have a seat and wait for Mr King, who would arrive at any moment. Then Marie realised that the day's work in the office began just before Mr King arrived. 
Later she found out that he lived in Connecticut and came into Manhattan on the same train every morning, arriving in the office at 9:35, so that his staff knew exactly when to start working. 
 Question:The people in the office suddenly started working because  _ 
A. they saw a stranger in the office 
B. they had finished their morning break 
C. no one wanted to talk to Marie 
D. the boss was about to arrive

Context: Miss Popular
I was awkward in middle school: bony and athletic, with a high grade in science and a low one in self-esteem. Though I had a few friends, I wasn't popular. I was picked last in football and I sometimes ate lunch by myself.
I remember the day Brittany came to our school. Her teeth were crooked , and she was a little overweight. Not that this mattered though, because she walked around like she was better than all of us. She was outspoken and incredibly frightening, making people lose confidence.
Around Brittany, I tried my best to go unnoticed. Standing out or stealing her spotlight could only result in one thing: conflict. Brittany was always the first girl picked for teams; I was lucky if I was picked at all. I was thrown the ball while she stood with the quarterback, chatting about the last party she'd gone to. I had never been to a party before or kissed a boy.
One day, a classmate asked me to the school dance. I was flattered. Then Brittany told me during science class that she had persuaded him to invite me. She asked in front of everyone, ""Why would anyone even want you?"" I went home and cried.
Although she was seemingly perfect in everyone's eyes, I wanted to be everything that she wasn't and yet a million times more perfect. Brittany was so frightening and violent, but I wanted to be calm and not at all aggressive.
I found Brittany's online profile a few weeks ago. She still had the same chubby  face and mocking simile, and had posted half-naked pictures of herself. But as I read on, I realized that Brittany had died in a drunken driving accident a year ago. She had been 16 and pregnant at the time. Suddenly my view of Brittany changed from a bad influence into a struggling little girl whose life was taken before she could understand right from wrong. My experience with Brittany taught me that though we are all innocent in our youth, the choices we make will have great effects on us forever. I will always remember Brittany as that loud, overconfident girl. As part of that shy insecure person I used to be will always keep me modest. 
 Question:The last passage is meant to  _  . 
A. tell us the reason for Brittany's death 
B. present the changed attitude to Brittany 
C. show the influences of the youth 
D. stress the importance of behaviors

When he got to school, he didn't say anything to his friends or teachers. Everyone started talking at once. They were excited, worried and surprised. Mrs. Jacobs seemed happy. Simon was bored because he couldn't talk.
But it wasn't so bad. He could do his homework. The next day,  even though his voice was coming back, he stayed quiet again. He listened and put up his hand to speak. What a great difference!

Context: Tyler was a troublesome student. He sat in the back row. Every time I called him to answer questions, he'd reply with a flip answer. If he got it wrong, he would get very angry.
Usually kids could sit quietly in class. However, Tyler was just loud. One day, Tyler was talking while I was teaching. I said to him, ""Tyler, why not join in our discussion instead of having one of your own?"" He got up from his chair, pushed it over, and shouted something I can't remember. I sent him to the office and he received a week's out-of-school punishment.
The week was a wonderful time for me, but when it came to an end, I began to feel worried. So I came up with a plan. On the day of his return, I told him I wanted to start over with him. If he felt like he was going to lose control in class, he could step outside the door for a moment.
From then on, Tyler was a changed student in my classroom. In fact he was a smart child and he even stopped a fight between two students one day. And he never used the privilege to leave the class for a moment. I believe that just letting him decide for himself made all the difference.
When the year was over, he wrote me a thank-you note about how good the year had been for him. I still have it today and find it very moving to reread when I get stressed about teaching. 
 Question:Tyler did all the following things EXCEPT  _  . 
A. sitting in the back row 
B. leaving the class for a moment 
C. stopping a fight between two students 
D. not listening to teachers in class

Context: Every man wants his son to be somewhat of a clone, not in features but in footsteps. As he grows you also age, and your ambitions become more unachievable. You begin to realize that your boy, in your footsteps, could probably accomplish what you hoped for. But footsteps can be muddied and they can go off in different directions.
My son Jody has hated school since day one in kindergarten. Science projects waited until the last moment. Book reports weren't written until the final threat.
I've been a newspaperman all my adult life. My daughter is a university graduate working toward her master's degree in English. But Jody? When he entered the tenth grade he became a ""vo-tech"" student . They're called ""motorheads"" by the rest of the student body.
When a secretary in my office first called him ""motorhead"", I was shocked. ""Hey, he's a good kid,"" I wanted to say. ""And smart, really.""
I learned later that motorheads are, indeed, different. They usually have dirty hands and wear dirty work clothes. And they don't often make school honor rolls .
But being the parent of a motorhead is itself an experience in education. We who labor in clean shirts in offices don't have the abilities that motorheads have. I began to learn this when I had my car crashed. The cost to repair it was estimated at $800. ""Hey, I can fix it,"" said Jody. I doubted it , but let him go ahead, for I had nothing to lose.
My son ,with other motorheads, fixed the car. They got parts from a junkyard, non-toasting toaster have been fixed. Neighbours and co-workers trust their car repair to him.
Since that first repair job, a broken air-conditioner, a non-functioning washer and a non-toasting toaster have been fixed. Neighbors and co-workers trust their car repairs to him.
These kids are happiest when doing repairs. They joke and laugh and are living in their own relaxed world. And their minds are bright despite their dirty hands and clothes.
I have learned a lot from my motorhead: publishers need printers, engineers need mechanics, and architects need builders. Most important, I have learned that fathers don't need clones in footsteps or anywhere else.
My son may never make the school honor roll. But he made mine. 
 Question:What used to be the author's hope for his son? 
A. To avoid becoming his clone. 
B. To resemble him in appearance. 
C. To develop in a different direction. 
D. To reach the author's unachieved goals.

This allowed us to become ""experts"" on one topic and teach the rest of our classmates.
Now ,I have become a more open-minded boy. That is because of my two and a half years in Mr.  Sultan's class.

Context: (Reuters)--Ceremonies to celebrate divorces have gained momentum in Japan after the massive March earthquake and tsunami, followed by an ongoing nuclear crisis, caused unhappy couples to reassess their lives.
The ceremony to mark a couple's transition to being single again costs 55,000 yen ($690), includes a buffet meal and culminates with the ritual smashing of their wedding rings with a gavel.
Tomoharu Saito, who took part in Tokyo with his wife Miki days before they were set to file for divorce, said crushing the rings felt cathartic. .
""I did not think the ring could be crushed that easily, but it did,""he said. 
""I was shocked but at the same time, I feel it helped me make a clean break.""
The ceremony also includes a ""divorce dress,"" and Miki Saito chose a daisy-yellow summer dress. In Japan, daisies are believed to symbolize an a ""friendly relationship"".
Designer Akiue Go said he created the dress with emphasis on the back for a specific reason. 
""I designed this dress so the woman's back looks the most beautiful when she turns around and walks away,"" he said. 
Hiroki Terai, a 31-year-old former salesman, spotted a gap in the market and pioneered the divorce ceremony two years ago. Since then, he's celebrated more than 80 breakups.
Requests for the ceremony have tripled since the March 11 9.0 magnitude quake set off a massive tsunami.
""The March 11 disaster made many couples rethink their priorities. Some found that work was a higher priority to them than family, and this helped people gain the confidence to decide on a divorce,"" Terai said.
""Those who want an amicable divorce are doing these ceremonies.""
Miki Saito said the earthquake made her realize she wanted to be closer to her parents, who live in northeastern Japan in one of the areas badly affected by the quake.
""After the quake, my desire to go back and live with my parents grew stronger,"" she said.
Guest Hiroko Tada was present for both the beginning and the end of the Saitos' marriage. ""I'd say congratulations to the amicable divorce,"" she said. ""I could have never imagined this day would come because I was at their wedding, but since they did break up, this is one of the best ways to do it."" 
 Question:How much has the divorce ceremony held by Terai cost in the past two years? 
A. About 56,000 yen 
B. About $50,000 
C. Less than 440,000 yen 
D. Over $ 55,200 
 Answer: D
Context: If you are a wealthy resident of India, madly in love and planning your big fat wedding--or being pressured into arranged marriage--Thailand wants you to exchange vows  in Bangkok, Phuket or elsewhere in this ""wedding Paradise "".
This wedding business starts from overseas with the Indians. Thai embassies in India give quick services for the visas. Not only the couples, you can bring anyone, say, your own cook. So, feel free to invite hundreds of your friends and relatives.
Why would Indians want to spend so much on weddings in Thailand? Because they have similarities in religion. When Indian weddings want to have some religious prayer for the couples, Thailand can do that. But the more obvious appeal are Thailand's fancy hotels, tropical islands, and delicious Thai food, allowing newlyweds to include a honeymoon in Thailand after they say ""I do"" while their guests also celebrate on a holiday here. But on the other hand, love does have a price.
Kasu Rajagopal arranged for his daughter to have a wedding in Phuket. They arranged entertainment to begin three days before the wedding, because guests' arrival time varied. Yachts were chartered to take guests to small islands, while a DJ, flown in from Bangalore, India, was booked to help them dance in the evening. Kasu also arranged priests for the Hindu wedding, and cooks to prepare Indian food. The approximate costs are around half a million U. S. dollars, including the airfares, hotel accommodation, food, transportation, the yachts on hire and the wedding ceremony expenses, for 225 to 250 guests.
Thailand wants to make itself a wedding paradise for all couples, not just from India, but from around the world. Last year, there were around 500 to 600 couples from China, and the numbers are slowly coming up. Westerners also arrive to get married, but in much smaller numbers. 
 Question:What is the main reason why the Indians would go to Thailand for weddings? 
A. They will be pressured into arranged married in India. 
B. India shares the same religion as Thailand. 
C. Thailand offers them more than just a wedding ceremony. 
D. Guests are not satisfied with Indian weddings.

Context: One afternoon Peter and Jim went out for a bicycle ride. When they passed a place they saw a large area of grass and bushes on fire and a strong wind was blowing the flames towards a village. The firemen had already arrived and were trying to put out the fire. The boys left their bicycles and ran towards the village to see if they could help to fight the fire. On the way they met two firemen. 
""Quick, you boys,"" said one of the firemen. ""Come and help us to pull a pump   to the stream. We can't beat out the fire. The wind is too strong. The pump is our only hope."" 
The two boys ran further until they came to a heavy pump. They helped to pull it to a stream not far from the village. 
Soon the pump was working well so the boys went to watch the fire. It had already reached the edge of the village. The boys saw that two houses were on fire, and the flames were attacking a third building. Suddenly there was a shout from one of the villagers. 
""Keep away!"" a voice shouted. ""There's paint stored in that building."" The boys and villagers moved away quickly. With a loud explosion  , the whole building burst into flames, sending clouds of thick black smoke into the sky. 
At this time Peter and Jim began to think that the whole village would be burnt to the ground. The firemen had left the burning buildings and were pouring   water onto the neighboring houses, trying to stop the fire from spreading. Then the wind died down. A second pump was brought up to help, and the fire was gradually put out. 
""It's soon finished,"" Peter said to his friend. ""We must go or we shall get home late."" ""Yes, come on,"" agreed Jim, and with a last look at the ruins, they walked back to their bicycles.

Context: When the world was very young, people lived in hot places .They didn't live in cold places because they could not keep warm there.
At first men didn't know how to make a fire. Sometimes trees were hit by lightning .Then a fire was started .People took some of the fire near their homes. A fire was very important for three reasons. It kept them warm. Wild animals were frightened when they saw it. And when food was cooked, it tasted much better.
But men didn't know how to make a fire. When they had a fire, they didn't let it stop burning. If it went out, they couldn't start it again. They had to wait for lightning to start another fire. Sometimes they had to wait for years.
Later, they learned how to make a fire. But it was not easy to make something burn . Now we have matches. We can carry them in our pockets and make a fire when we want to.

Context: Our listener question this week comes from Abdullahi Farah, who wants to know about the life and work of Doctor Benjamin Carson.
Doctor Carson is an internationally recognized doctor at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. He has been the director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at the hospital for twenty-five years. At the age of thirty-three, he became one of the youngest doctors in the United States to hold that position. And he was the first African-American to have that position at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
Ben Carson is known for his work as a brain surgeon for children. For example, in nineteen eighty-seven, he led a team of seventy doctors and nurses in an operation to separate two babies joined at the head. Earlier attempts by other
on other babies had failed. Doctor Carson successfully performed the operation. Both babies were able to survive independently.
Doctor Carson has written four books. His first book, ""Gifted Hands,"" tells the story of his life. Benjamin Carson was born in nineteen fifty-one in Detroit, Michigan.
As a boy, Ben was not a good student. In fact, he was the worst in his class. When his mother learned of his failing grades she asked her sons to read two library books every week. She limited the amount of time they watched television. And she told them to respect every person.
Ben Carson soon became the top student in his class. He went on to study at Yale University, one of the best universities in the country, and later to medical school at the University of Michigan.
Doctor Carson has received many awards and honors. Last year he received the nation's highest civilian honor. Former President George W. Bush presented Benjamin Carson with the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a ceremony at the White House.

""After everything I'd done for the company, they dismiss me by text! I was so angry and I just didn't feel like looking for another job. I hated everything about the city and my life.""
Then, Zoe received an invitation from an old school friend, Kathy, to come and stay. Kathy and her husband, Huw, had just bought a farm in north west Wales. Zoe jumped at the chance to spend a weekend away from London, and now, then months later, she is still on the farm.

Context: One evening after dinner, Mr. and Mrs. Tisich called a family meeting. ""We've had to make a difficult decision,"" Mr. Tisich announced. ""You see, your mother has been offered a post as co-director of a television station in Chicago. Unfortunately, the station is not here. After thinking long and hard about it, we've concluded that the right decision is to move to Chicago."" Marc looked shocked, while his sister Rachel breathlessly started asking when they'd be moving. ""It's surprising, but exciting!"" she said. Marc simply said, ""We can't go--I can't leave all my friends. I'd rather stay here and live with Tommy Lyons!""
The Tisichs hoped that by the time they moved in August, Marc would grow more used to the idea of leaving. However, he showed no signs of accepting the news, refusing to pack his belongings. When the morning of the move arrived, Marc was nowhere to be found. His parents called Tommy Lyon's house, but Mrs. Lyons said she hadn't seen Marc. Mrs. Tisich became increasingly concerned, while her husband felt angry with their son for behaving so irresponsibly.
What they didn't know was that Marc had started walking over to Tommy's house, with a faint idea of hiding in Lyons's attic  for a few days. But something happened on the way as Marc walked past all the familiar landscape of the neighborhood: the fence that he and his mother painted, the tree that he and his sister used to climb, the park where he and his father often took evening walks together. How much would these mean without his family, who make them special in the first place? Marc didn't take the time to answer that question but instead hurried back to his house, wondering if there were any moving cartons the right size to hold his record collection. 
 Question:The reason for Marc's going home was that  _  . 
A. he did not want to be left behind 
B. he realized his family was important to him 
C. he hoped to reach an agreement with his parents

But this was worse than ever; there were buses there--high and terribly red cars, taxis and still more buses in an endless line. Everywhere there were people hurrying past or waiting to get into the buses, while I stood lost in the middle of them.

He began to explain, but when he saw that I couldn't understand he became helpless, too. ""Are you French at school?"" A few minutes later, he smiled and raised his hand. How wonderful!

Context: Dear Guys,
I'd like to talk to you about the two minutes of total embarrassments you put me through last night. You a group of fit, young men, were playing soccer on the field across from my apartment building, I, a beautiful looking young woman, was walking by with my groceries. That's when your ball came flying over the fence and landed at my feet. One of you came to me, and asked politely if I would throw the ball back to you.
Fighting the urge to flee screaming down the street, I agreed. And I put my bags down, picked up the ball and with eyes half shut, threw it as hard as I could. It hit the middle of the fence and bounced right back to me.
I picked up the ball again and threw the ball upward with all my strength. The ball once again hit slightly higher up on the fence and bounced back to me. This is the point where I start to blame you. Wouldn't it have been a better use of your time, and mine, if you had just walked around the fence and collected the ball then? I was clearly struggling. And yet you all just stood there, staring.
Seeing that you weren't  going to get the ball yourselves, I become desperate. But I picked up the soccer ball for the third time. I forced a smile while crying inside as you patiently shouted words of support over the fence at me like I was a two-year-old holding a beech ball for the first time.
""Throw it granny-style!"" one of you said. ""Just back up a little end throw it hard!"" another offered And, most embarrassing of all, ""You can do it!"" I know you thought you were being encouraging, but it only served to deepen the embarrassment. However, I accepted your advice, took a deep breath, and let it fly. It hid the edge of the -fence and bounced back to me.
I hoped that I would have a heart attack and pass out, just so I'd be put out of my misery. Alas, the heart attack didn't happen. Finally, I had to pick up the ball, walked close to the fence, and said angrily, ""Please just come top get it."" And you did. And thanks to you, I decided at that moment I would never throw anything over again, except scornful glances at people who play sports.
Sincerely yours,

 Answer: D
Context: Dear Guys,
I'd like to talk to you about the two minutes of total embarrassments you put me through last night. You a group of fit, young men, were playing soccer on the field across from my apartment building, I, a beautiful looking young woman, was walking by with my groceries. That's when your ball came flying over the fence and landed at my feet. One of you came to me, and asked politely if I would throw the ball back to you.
Fighting the urge to flee screaming down the street, I agreed. And I put my bags down, picked up the ball and with eyes half shut, threw it as hard as I could. It hit the middle of the fence and bounced right back to me.
I picked up the ball again and threw the ball upward with all my strength. The ball once again hit slightly higher up on the fence and bounced back to me. This is the point where I start to blame you. Wouldn't it have been a better use of your time, and mine, if you had just walked around the fence and collected the ball then? I was clearly struggling. And yet you all just stood there, staring.

Context: My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation wasn't wonderful,but we had everything we needed(beds,blankets,food),and we were pleased to be out of the city and in the fresh air.
On Saturday morning we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron had come along with two friends,Kevin and Simon,while sisters Carole and Lynn had come with Amanda. There were some other members I didn't know. We had come from different places and none of us knew the area.
We knew we were going to spend the weekend outdoors,but none of us was sure exactly how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock-climbing and then we changed at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves  first. Climbing out was harder than going in,but after a good deal of pushing, we were out at last. Though we were covered with mud,we were pleased and excited by what we'd done.

Context: How much empathy do you feel towards other people? If you saw someone fall off their bike in traffic,would you stop and help--or just walk away? Many people would give in to coldness,go about their business and just do nothing.So it was a big surprise when about  100 bystanders got together recently to move a bus in east London to help a cyclist trapped under it.A video of the incident went viral on social media.
According to Zoheb,a driver who stopped his car to take part in the rescue,about five  people gathered to move the bus.He says:""There was no chance we could do it,it was more  an invitation for other people to help,really.""
The initiative paid off.Diners from nearby restaurants joined in.There wasn't much coordination but it didn't take long to develop a collective understanding of what the  objective was.
Spontaneous cooperation among strangers doesn't happen often.People in a  crowd are not sure what to do--they don't have a plan.It's one of the reasons bystanders often do nothing,according to Dr Mark Levine,professor of social psychology at Exeter University in Britain.""The presence of others can prevent you from helping"",he says.
The key to positive group behaviour,Levine explains,""is building a sense of shared identity"".Action has to be decided quickly,Levine says.""The longer you leave it,the harder it is to make a decision.If you don't immediately act then you kind of think'Well,actually I probably couldn't have done anything anyway'.""
But the people who took the initiative like Zoheb might make a difference.The cyclist ended up in hospital and the images of the collective effort might inspire others to more acts of unity. 
 Question:Why do people give in to coldness when they should be helping according to Levine? 
A. They don't know how to give first aid. 
B. Nobody wants to be the first to offer help. 
C. Strangers seldom cooperate with each other. 
D. They are forbidden from helping.

Context: Charlotte's Web is a popular American children's book about the friendship between a pig named Wilbur and a spider  named Charlotte. The writer, E.B. White, shows that a real friend will help you even though he or she has nothing to get from doing so.
In the book, Charlotte is always helping Wilbur. She spins  words into her web to save Wilbur's life, even though spinning the words is tiring and difficult for her. Charlotte is a true friend. She helps Wilbur for only one reason - she cares about him.
Templeton, the rat, on the other hand, is not a real friend to Wilbur. Templeton only helps others when there is something in it for him. When he is asked to help save Wilbur's life, he says ""no"" at first. Later on, he agrees to help, but only because he wants to keep eating Wilbur's meals. At the end of the book, Wilbur learns the true meaning of friendship. He helps Charlotte to save her babies. He does this not for other reasons, but because he cares about his friend.
Reading this book lets me know how important it is to help others. Being a good friend means being there when you are needed.

Context: The man who admitted to killing an Italian woman inside her East Harlem apartment said he was possessed by an ""evil spell  ,"" police said Thursday.
    Bakary Camara, 41, who once dated the murdered woman, penned his admission of guilt in a three-page letter folded in his pocket as he tried to kill himself after policemen burst into his home. Kelly, a policeman, said ""He says that there was an evil spell that was cast on him.""
Camara, who was in stable condition at St. Barnabas Hospital, was later charged with the murder of Rita Morelli.
    The 36-year-old woman was getting a degree at Borough of Manhattan Community College as she waited tables at Caffe Buon Gusto on the upper East Side, police said. Camara called 911 from a payphone after killing the lively Morelli on Nov. 23.

    Policemen began dialing numbers from Morelli's cell phone and when Camara picked up, a detective recognized his voice as the man who called in the report of a dead body, police said. When officers went to Camara's home, he locked himself inside, forcing policemen to burst down the front door to catch him.
    ""He is standing there with a knife pointed at his chest,"" Kelly, a policeman, said. ""He makes threatening statements as to the fact that he killed the woman. He then stabs himself in the chest.""
Camara, who told police he served six years in prison for robbery back in his native country, was still waiting to be charged with murder Thursday.

Context: Dear Betty,
My roommate's family wants me to celebrate Thanksgiving Day with them in their home. I accepted the invitation, and I'm excited about going, but I'm a little nervous about it, too. The social customs in my country are different from those here, so I'm a little worried about making mistakes.
Should I bring a gift, such as candy or flowers? Should I arrive on time or a little late?  At the dinner table, how can I know which fork or knife to use? How can I let the family know that I'm thankful for their kindness?
                                               Yours,
                                               Knowing Nothing
Dear Knowing Nothing,
 It's a good idea to bring a gift when you go to a dinner party. Flowers are always welcome, or you can bring a bottle of wine if you know the family drink it.
You should arrive on time or five to ten minutes late. Don't get there early. If you are going to be more than fifteen minutes late, you should call and tell them.
Try to relax at the dinner table. If you don't know how to use the right fork, knife or spoon, just watch the other guests, and follow them. If you still have no idea of what to do, don't be shy about asking the person next to you; it's better to ask them than to be silently uncomfortable and nervous.
If you like the food, say so. Of course, you'll thank the host and hostess for the meal and for their kindness. It's also a good idea to send a card to thank them the day after.
                                          Yours,
                                              Betty

Context: Dear Jenny,
Gary is having a _ party after Month Exam! He invites all of us to come! Since it is a potluck party, I think I will bring some beef noodles. As I know, Lily will take care of the drinks and Gina will bring a big homemade chocolate cake. Can you ask your mom to buy us some KFC fried chicken? You know it is too far for all of us to ride a bike there, but your mom often drives there. We can pay the bill together. Just think about how surprised our classmates will feel when they see what we prepare! Isn't it great?
The party will start at noon on March 25, so be sure to be at Gary's place around 11:30 to prepare for the party. By the way, don't forget to invite Amy, who is good at music. If you have any other questions, just call me or write me back.
Take care!
Leo

Context: Some British and American people like to invite friends for a meal at home.  You should not be upset if your English friends don't invite you home.  It doesn't mean they don't like you!
Dinner parties usually start between 7 p. m.  and 8 p. m.  and end at about 11 p. m.  Ask your host what time you should arrive.  It's polite to bring flowers, chocolates or a bottle of wine as a gift.

Context: What could make Michael Jordon, one of the greatest basketball players in history, shed tears?  It was when he became a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame on September 11. The hall is in Springfield, Massachusetts and honors the best basketball players, greatest coaches and other contributors to the game. ""The game of basketball has been everything to me ,"" said Jordan, 46. ""It is the place I have always gone when I needed to find comfort and peace.""
Jordan retired twice in his 15-year career, finishing with 32292 points, the third highest total points in NBA history behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone. His average of 30.12 points a game is the best in the League.
""One day you might look up and see me playing the game at 50,"" Jordan said. ""Because limits, like fears, are often just an illusion.""   In other words, it was motivation that made Jordan such a success..
A great career did not mean a smooth one. His high school coach cut him from the team in favor of a taller player when Jordan was in 10thgrade. His college coach wouldn't allow him on the cover of Sports Illustration in 1981 with North Carolina's four other players because Jordan was a freshman. In his first NBA All-Star game, older NBA stars wouldn't throw him the ball because of jealousy.
""That burned me up,"" Jordan said. ""But _ don't have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it.""

Context: As far back as he could remember,Larry had longed to go to Hollywood and become a film star. The young man's hopes for success were broken again and again, however. Hollywood just did not seem interesting. When he first came to California, Larry had decided never to give up and return home without success. Therefore, he kept on trying. Someday, he told himself, his big opportunity would come.
Larry found a job parking cars for one of Hollywood's big restaurants. His pay was basic, but since the guests were kind enough to give him more money, he managed to make a living. One day he recognized an important film director driving into the parking lot and getting out of his car. Larry had recently heard that the man was ready to make a new picture.
Larry got into the car and prepared to drive it on into the lot and park it. Then he stopped, jumped out, and ran over to the director. ""Excuse me, sir, but I think it is only fair to tell you that it is now or never if you want me in your next picture. A lot of big companies are after me.""
Instead of pushing away the boy,the director laughed,then wrote something on a card and handed it to the young man."" Come and see me tomorrow.""
Larry got a small part in the director's next film. 
 Question:Which of the following was Larry really interested in? 
A. Working as a waiter. 
B. Becoming a film star. 
C. Parking cars for film stars. 
D. Owning a big company.

""Mr.Fredy gave me a second chance, ""says Pearman, "" And I took advantage of it.I could have just come here a while, eaten up and left.But there is no future in washing windshields.""

Context: Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver, and the other gold.
This song expresses a nice rule: increasing friends. Sometimes things actually work out that way. I've met adults who've said, ""We've been friends since kindergarten!"" A friend who has known you forever is a treasure. But friendships don't always last -- especially for children.
When I was growing up, my family moved about every three years. The advantage of this was that I got to see different parts of the world, and it made my family very close. I also learned to be pretty good at making new friends, and, to keep in touch with old friends, I became a great letter writer. But I always admired those kids who stayed in one place and kept their friends for a long time. I didn't learn that children's friendships can disappear even when no one moves until I was much older, with children of my own.
Sometimes friendships end in quarrels and hurt feelings. But perhaps the most painful end to a friendship is the one-sided rejection -- one friend turns away, or chooses someone else as a close friend, and the other child is left feeling sad and wondering why this thing happened. The end of a friendship is often sad, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. Often the end of one friendship makes more room for other friendships to grow. 
 Question:When his family moved often, the author couldn't  _  . 
A. make friends easily 
B. become a good letter writer 
C. stay with his friends for a long time 
D. see many different places 
 Answer: C
Context: Being able to count at least ten people as friends makes us happy, but those with five or fewer are likely to be miserable, researchers say. Their study of hundreds of men and women also found t hat people who feel satisfied with their lives always have lots of close friends and regularly make new ones. While it is not clear whether our friends make us happy or we make friends because we are happy, the researchers say it is clear that we should maintain our friendships. Psychologist RichardTunney said, ""Whatever the reason is, actively working on friendships in the same way as to maintain a marriage is a prerequisite  to happiness. ""Dr. Tunney, of Nottingham University, quizzed more than 1,700 people about their satisfaction  with their lives and the state of their friendships. Those with five friends or fewer had just a 40 percent chance of being happy.  In other words they were more likely to be unhappy than happy. Ten was the first number at which people were more likely to be happy than unhappy. The happiest people were those with dozens of friends, according to the study, which was carried out for the National Lottery .
For women, this meant having 33 friends;for men, the number was 49. Dr. Tunney said,""People who were extremely satisfied with their lives had twice the number of friends of people  who were extremely dissatisfied. "" Women tended to have fewer friends than men but formed tighter relationships. Interestingly, the study found that childhood friends are no more likely to make us happy than people we become close to later in life. Lottery winners, however, have a differentopinion on life. They are always happier than others despite spending their time with asmall circle of old friends. This could be because they trust people they've known for along time. 
 Question:What's the best title for this passage? 
A. The Secret to Happiness Is to Make New Friends 
B. Having at Least 10 Good Friends Makes People Happy 
C. Why Most People Like to Make Friends Regularly 
D. Men's and Women's Friends Are Different

Context: Jascha Richter once sang ""don't need too much talking without saying anything"" to reveal his lonely feeling in a crowd.
Dad always told me never to ever reveal my true opinions towards other people if such opinions are negative. He said this is the ""Chu Shi Zhe Xue"", the philosophy of dealing with social network.
It seems that everybody here just follows this philosophy very, very well.
Friends. I would say that if I were given true friendship I would definitely treasure it with my greatest care. If I really regard someone as my close friend, I would never leave her alone whenever she's in need, either financially or mentally. And I always believe, as long as I treat people with whole-hearted honesty, I would have some rewards--at least, just ONE true friend of the same gender .
Sometimes I just miss my friends in China. Perhaps when we became friends, we were still young, too young to have been polluted by any dirt in the society. But here, it is simply different. It seems that all of us have learnt how to SURVIVE in a foreign land and such an experience actually makes us learn how to extract   the most benefits from the surroundings in order to survive.
All are friends around me. I've looked through all the dark sides of their personalities and yet I have to pretend that I know nothing. THEY ARE GOOD. THEY ARE GOOD. AND WE ARE FRIENDS. And then I can make myself comfortable enough to talk to people I hate the most. And of course, they don't say any words truly from their hearts. Neither do I.
But, sometimes I just feel unwilling to talk to these people. Sometimes, I just want to be alone, quietly, without being forced to listen to their gossip or other useless words.
""Standing on a mountain high
Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky
I should go and see some friends
But they don't really comprehend""

Context: The judge  thought Geoffrey Payne killed his wife. Now for the first time Payne wrote to a magazine from the prison about what happened on the night of 13 October 1999.
I had to stay late at the hospital that night to do an operation. I finally left at about 11p.m.. I drove home slowly because the wind was blowing and it was raining heavily. I was running into our road when a man suddenly ran in front of my car. I almost hit him but I stopped just in time. I was scared and the man looked scared, too. I got out of the car but he ran away before I could ask if he was all right. It was very strange.
When I got home, the lights were on but it was very quiet. I called to my wife but there was no answer. Then I remembered that she was out at a concert.
I was still very unhappy about what happened on the road, so I made myself a drink. Then I went upstairs to have a bath. I saw that the window in the bedroom was open. This was strange because my wife always locked the doors and windows before she went out. She was afraid of burglars. When I went to close it, I found Ellen. She was lying on the floor. There was blood everywhere. I rushed over for her pulse but she was dead. I was so scared. I sat on the floor beside her body without knowing what to do.
The next thing I knew was that the sky was getting light. I can't remember a thing about that night. In the morning I phoned the police. They arrived half an hour after I phoned them. But it seemed like hours. During that time I tried hard to remember anything I could about the night before. I couldn't stop thinking about the man in the road. What was he doing at that time of night in our quiet neighborhood?

Context: When I was at university,  I studied very hard. But a lot of my friends did very little work. Some did just enough to pass exams. Others didn't do quite enough. Fred Baines was one of them. He spent more time drinking in the Students' Union than working in the library. Once, at the end of the term, we had to take an important test in chemistry. The test had a hundred questions. Beside each question we had to write ""True"" or ""False"". While I was studying in my room the night before the test, Fred was watching television. Fred usually worried a lot the night before a test. But that night he looked perfectly calm. Then he told me of his plan. ""It's very simple. There are a hundred questions and I have to get fifty correct to pass the test. I'll take a coin into the examination room. I haven't studied a chemistry book for months, so I'll just toss the coin. In that way, I'm sure I'll get half the questions right."" The next day, Fred came cheerfully into the examination room. As he sat tossing a coin for half an hour he marked down his answers. Then he left half an hour before the rest of us. The next day, he saw the chemistry professor in the corridor.
""Oh good,"" he said, ""Have you got the results of the test?""
The professor looked at him and smiled.

 Answer: B
Context: When I was at university,  I studied very hard. But a lot of my friends did very little work. Some did just enough to pass exams. Others didn't do quite enough. Fred Baines was one of them. He spent more time drinking in the Students' Union than working in the library. Once, at the end of the term, we had to take an important test in chemistry. The test had a hundred questions. Beside each question we had to write ""True"" or ""False"". While I was studying in my room the night before the test, Fred was watching television. Fred usually worried a lot the night before a test. But that night he looked perfectly calm. Then he told me of his plan. ""It's very simple. There are a hundred questions and I have to get fifty correct to pass the test. I'll take a coin into the examination room. I haven't studied a chemistry book for months, so I'll just toss the coin. In that way, I'm sure I'll get half the questions right."" The next day, Fred came cheerfully into the examination room. As he sat tossing a coin for half an hour he marked down his answers. Then he left half an hour before the rest of us. The next day, he saw the chemistry professor in the corridor.
""Oh good,"" he said, ""Have you got the results of the test?""
The professor looked at him and smiled.
""Ah, it's you, Baines, just a minute.""
Then he reached into his pocket and took out a coin. He threw it into the air, caught it in his hand and looked at it.
""I'm terribly sorry, Baines,"" he said, ""You failed!"" 
 Question:Fred often went to the Students' Union where he   _   . 
A. worked extra hours 
B. enjoyed himself in the bar 
C. borrowed books 
D. attended a few lectures 
 Answer: B
Context: Cheating can happen in a lot of different ways. When people cheat, it's not fair to other people, like the kids who studiedfor the test or who were the true winners of a game.
Many people like the action of cheating. It makes difficult things seem easy, like getting all the right answers on the test. But it doesn't solve the problem of not knowing the material and it won't help on the next test --- unless the person cheats again.
Some people lose respect for cheaters and think less of them. The cheaters themselves may feel bad because they know they are not really earning that good grade. And, if they get caught cheating, they will be in trouble at school, and maybe at home, too.
Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating. Even when there seems to be a ""good reason"" for cheating, cheating isn't a good idea.
If you were sick or upset about something the night before and couldn't study, it would be better to talk with the teacher about this. And if you don't have enough time to study for a test because of swim practice, you need to talk with your parents about how to balance swimming and school.
A kid who thinks cheating is the only way to pass a test needs to talk with the teacher and his or her parents so they can find some solutions  together. Talking about these problems and working them out will be better than cheating. 
 Question:In the passage those cheaters are advised to  _  . 
A. spend more time on school than on sports 
B. try hard to be intelligent rather than lazy 
C. find good solutions instead of cheating 
D. ask their classmates for good methods of study

Wentworth Girls' School
Beachside
July 20th
Dearest Mom and Dad,
I'm afraid I have some very bad news for you. I have been very naughty and the school principal is very angry with me. She is going to write to you. You must come and take me away from here. She does not want me in the school any longer.
The trouble started last night when I was smoking in bed.  This is against the rules, of course. We are not supposed to smoke at all.
As I was smoking, I heard footsteps coming towards the room. I did not want a teacher to catch me smoking, so I threw the cigarette away.
Unfortunately, the cigarette fell into the waste-paper basket, which caught fire.
There was a curtain near the waste-paper basket which caught fire, too. Soon the whole room was burning.
The principal phoned for the fire department. The school is a long way from the town and by the time the fire department arrived, the whole school was in flames. Many of the girls are in the hospital.
The principal says that the fire was all my fault and you must pay for the damage. She will send you a bill for about a million dollars.
I'm very sorry about this.
Much love,
Sarah

Context: Migrants to the UK are to be quizzed about their English skills before being able to claim income-related benefits, the government has announced.
In a move to ""protect the integrity of the benefits system"", people will also be asked what efforts they have made to find work before coming to Britain. Work and Pensions Secretary Duncan Smith said people should not be able to ""take advantage"" of British benefits. Job centres in England, Scotland and Wales will use the ""more mighty"" test. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said the test would ensure ""only migrants who have a legal right to be in Britain and plan to contribute to this country can make a claim for benefits"".
""For the first time, migrants will be quizzed about what efforts they have made to find work before coming to the UK and whether their English language skills will be a barrier to them finding employment,"" the DWP said in a statement.
Income-related benefits include council tax benefit, housing benefit, income-based jobseeker's allowance and pension credit.
Mr. Duncan Smith said British people were ""rightly concerned"" that migrants should contribute to the economy and should not be ""drawn here by the attractiveness of our benefits system"".
""It is vitally important that we have strict rules in place to protect the integrity of our benefits system,"" he said. He said the new test would help create a fair system which provided for ""genuine"" workers and jobseekers but ""does not allow people to come to our country and take advantage"".
To claim the benefits, migrants will have to pass a ""habitual residence test"" including more than 100 extra questions compared to now. This will be overseen by an ""intelligent IT system"" which will ensure questions are ""tailored to each individual _ "".
Migrants will be allowed to claim benefits if they can prove they are legally allowed to be in Britain and are ""habitually resident"" of the country. As part of this they might be questioned about what measures they have taken to ""establish"" themselves in Britain and what ties they still have abroad.
""They will also have to provide more evidence that they are doing everything they can to find a job,"" the DWP said. 
 Question:What does the passage mainly want to inform us? 
A. All migrants can claim benefits from the UK. 
B. Income-related benefits can be a great help to migrants. 
C. All migrants come to the UK only to claim benefits. 
D. Migrants are to pass a test to get the benefits from the UK.

 Answer: C
Context: My friend Kathy and I were going to Colorado Springs for holiday. The only problem was, I didn't have any luggage to pack my belongings in.
My friend Debbie offered to lend me a suitcase that belonged to her father, who had passed away long ago. ""I don't know if you'll want to use it,"" she said so gently, ""it's very old, worn out, and such an ugly yellow color1."" I was so touched by her offer to lend something that belonged to her father, but I was also concerned about the possibility of it being damaged or lost. She insisted that I take it. So with the suitcase safely in hand, I boarded the train with Kathy.
We spent two days and one night on the train, sleeping in our seats. As we slept, we were awakened at times, by the noises of the train pulling in and out of the stations.
The next morning we eagerly awaited the announcement: Next stop, Colorado Springs. But suddenly, there came another announcement over the loud speaker. ""During one of the overnight stops, many pieces of luggage were mistakenly removed from the train and left at the wrong location.""
Kathy and I just looked at each other, as I felt the disappointment swell. Could my worst fear be coming true, was Debbie's suitcase lost?
Just then two train conductors passed our seats. One of them jokingly said to the other, ""Did you ever see such an old, ugly, brighter yellow, piece of luggage in all of your life?""
Before the other conductor could answer, I screamed, ""YES, MY SUITCASE MADE IT!""
 The two conductors stopped in their tracks! and, very red in the face, couldn't seem to apologize enough for having insulted my suitcase.
 When I returned it, I couldn't wait to get the suitcase back into Debbie's safe hands. She asked, ""Did everything go well on the trip?"" Somehow, I just couldn't resist telling her what had happened. She laughed heartily. 
When I recall the golden suitcase, I'm reminded, that like the suitcase, we can see ourselves as too old, useless, worn out, and of little value. Or, we can take a closer look and realize that we are one of God's most valued creations -- unique, and holding inside our most valuable possessions -- that of love, faith, hope, and wisdom. 
 Question:How did the two conductors feel when the author claimed her suitcase? 
A. Puzzled. 
B. Embarrassed. 
C. Astonished. 
D. Amused. 
 Answer: B
Context: Miss Popular
I was awkward in middle school: bony and athletic, with a high grade in science and a low one in self-esteem. Though I had a few friends, I wasn't popular. I was picked last in football and I sometimes ate lunch by myself.
I remember the day Brittany came to our school. Her teeth were crooked , and she was a little overweight. Not that this mattered though, because she walked around like she was better than all of us. She was outspoken and incredibly frightening, making people lose confidence.
Around Brittany, I tried my best to go unnoticed. Standing out or stealing her spotlight could only result in one thing: conflict. Brittany was always the first girl picked for teams; I was lucky if I was picked at all. I was thrown the ball while she stood with the quarterback, chatting about the last party she'd gone to. I had never been to a party before or kissed a boy.
One day, a classmate asked me to the school dance. I was flattered. Then Brittany told me during science class that she had persuaded him to invite me. She asked in front of everyone, ""Why would anyone even want you?"" I went home and cried.
Although she was seemingly perfect in everyone's eyes, I wanted to be everything that she wasn't and yet a million times more perfect. Brittany was so frightening and violent, but I wanted to be calm and not at all aggressive.
I found Brittany's online profile a few weeks ago. She still had the same chubby  face and mocking simile, and had posted half-naked pictures of herself. But as I read on, I realized that Brittany had died in a drunken driving accident a year ago. She had been 16 and pregnant at the time. Suddenly my view of Brittany changed from a bad influence into a struggling little girl whose life was taken before she could understand right from wrong. My experience with Brittany taught me that though we are all innocent in our youth, the choices we make will have great effects on us forever. I will always remember Brittany as that loud, overconfident girl. As part of that shy insecure person I used to be will always keep me modest. 
 Question:The last passage is meant to  _  . 
A. tell us the reason for Brittany's death 
B. present the changed attitude to Brittany 
C. show the influences of the youth 
D. stress the importance of behaviors

Context: Four days after Dad's 67thbirthday, he had a heart attack. Luckily, he survived. But something inside him had died. His enthusiasm for life was gone. He refused to follow doctor's orders, and his sour attitude made everyone upset when they visit him. Dad was left alone.
So I asked Dad to come to live with me on my small farm, hoping the fresh air would help him adjust. Within a week after he moved in, I regretted the invitation. He criticized everything I did. I became frustrated. Something had to be done.
One day I read an article which said when given dogs, depressed patients would be better off. So I drove to the animal shelter that afternoon. As soon as I got there, a pointer's eyes caught my attention. They watched me calmly.
A staff member said: ""He got here two weeks ago and we've heard nothing. His time is up tomorrow.""
I turned to the man in horror. ""You mean you're going to kill him?""
""Ma'am,"" he said gently. ""We don't have room for every unclaimed dog.""
The police's calm brown eyes awaited my decision. ""I'll take him,"" I said.
I drove home with the dog on the front seat beside me. I was helping it out of the car when Dad walked onto the front porch. ""Look what I got you!"" I said excitedly.
Dad wrinkled his face. ""I don't want it,"" he muttered, turning back towards the house. Then, suddenly, the dog pulled free from my grasp. He sat down in front of my Dad.
Dad's anger melted, and soon he was hugging the dog.
This was the beginning of a warm friendship. Dad named the dog Cheyenne. Together they spent long hours walking down dusty lanes and relaxing on the banks of streams.
Dad's bitterness faded, and he and Cheyenne went on to make many friends. Then, late one night two years later, I felt Cheyenne's cold nose burrowing   through my bed covers. He had never before come into my bedroom at night. I ran into my father's room and found that he had passed away.
Two days later, my shock and grief deepened when I discovered Cheyenne lying dead beside Dad's bed. As I buried him near their favorite stream, I silently thanked the dog for restoring Dad's peace of mind.

Context: When she was a girl of sixteen and before she began to work in the store , Alice had dated a young man. The young man, named Ned Currie, was older than Alice. He was employed on the local newspaper and for a long time he went to see Alice almost every evening. Together the two walked under the trees through the streets of the town and talked of what they would do with their lives. Alice was then a very pretty girl and one night Ned took her into his arms and kissed her. He became excited and said things he did not intend to say and Alice, betrayed by her desire to have something beautiful come into her narrow life, also grew excited. She also talked. The outer crust of her life , all of her natural shyness and reserve, was torn away and she gave herself over to the emotions of love.
When,late in the fall,Ned went away to Cleveland to try to get a place on a city newspaper and rise in the world , she wanted to go with him.  _ she told him what was in her mind. ""I will work and you can work,she said. ""I don't want to tie you to a needless expense that will stop you making progress. Don't marry me now. We'll get along without that and we can be together. Even though we live in the same house, no one will say anything. In the city we'll be unknown and people will pay no attention to us.""
Ned was puzzled by his sweetheart's determination and was also deeply touched. He had wanted a girlfriend just to relieve the boredom of his life but had changed his mind. He now wanted to protect her and care for her. ""You don't know what you're talking about,he said sharply; ""I'll let you do no such thing. As soon as I get a good job , I'll come back. For the present you'll have to stay here. It's the only thing we can do.
On the evening before he left Winesburg, Ned went to call on Alice. They walked about through the streets for an hour and then went for a drive in the country. The moon came up and they found themselves unable to talk. They stopped at a place where a long meadow ran down to the bank of Wine Creek and there in the dim light he kissed her and promised he would love her forever. When they returned to town, it did not seem to them that anything in the future could blot out  the wonder and beauty of that evening. ''Now we will have to stick to each other; whatever happens, we will have to do that,"" Ned said as he left the girl at her father's door.
He did not succeed in getting a place on a Cleveland newspaper and went west to Chicago. For a time he was lonely and wrote to Alice almost every day. Then he was caught up by the life of the city ;he began to make friends and found  new interests in life. In Chicago he boarded at a house where there were several women. One of them attracted his attention and he forgot Alice in Winesburg. At the end of a year he had stopped writing letters, and only once in a long time when he was lonely or when he went into one of the city parks and saw the moon shining on the grass as it had shone that night on the meadow by Wine Creek did he think of her at all. 
 Question:Which of the following words can BEST describe Ned? 
A. Protective 
B. Changeable 
C. Greedy 
D. Faithful

Context: Around six weeks ago, Kaileen came running into the house, just getting off the bus from school. She was all excited about a story about homeless pets because of Hurricane   Katrina and all that was going on to help them. She said that this information came from her animal newspaper (your KIND News). Kaileen has a great love and compassion   for animals, so her excitement did not surprise me. Her next ideas, however, did. She said that we should go around right then to our neighbors and collect all their change to send to the animal shelters  .
         I thought this was a school project, but in fact, it was not. This was what Kaileen wanted to do on her own! Well, it warmed me all over. To see your child so willing to help others just lets you feel that maybe you had done something right in raising   her. 
         Anyway, I told her to make a card and send it out to our neighbors first. With the help of her older brother, Kaileen soon made a lovely card that asked our neighbors to help these pets by giving their spare change. She gave them a few days and a date she would come by to pick up any donations  .  
         Well, I had to go out and buy a donation box. Kaileen collected $279.50!!! I just thought you would like to know how KIND News had touched a little one's heart and given her the idea to show her compassion for animals. Thank you -- we really enjoy your paper.

A. collects donations for homeless people 
B. sets up many shelters for homeless animals

Context: It was a quarter past nine as Marie hurried into the office building where she was going to work. Her bus had inched along through heavy morning traffic, making her a few minutes late for her very first job. She decided to start out half an hour earlier the next day  
Once inside the lobby, she had to stand at the elevators and wait several minutes before she could get on one going to the sixth floor. When she finally reached the office marked ""King Enterprises"", she knocked at the door nervously and waited. There was no answer. She tapped on the door again, but still, there was no reply. From inside the next office, she could hear the sound of voices, so she opened the door and went in. Although she was sure it was the same office she had been in two weeks before when she had had the interview with Mr King, it looked quite different now. In fact, it hardly looked like an office at all. The employees were just standing around chatting and smoking. At the far end of the room, somebody must have just told a good joke, she thought, because there was a loud burst of laughter as she came in. 
For a moment she had thought they were laughing at her. Then one of the men looked at his watch, clapped his hands and said something to the others. Quickly they all went to their desks and, in a matter of seconds, everyone was hard at work. No one paid any attention to Marie. 
Finally she went up to the man who was sitting at the desk nearest to the door and explained that this was her first day in the office. Hardly looking up from his work, he told her to have a seat and wait for Mr King, who would arrive at any moment. Then Marie realised that the day's work in the office began just before Mr King arrived. 
Later she found out that he lived in Connecticut and came into Manhattan on the same train every morning, arriving in the office at 9:35, so that his staff knew exactly when to start working. 
 Question:The people in the office suddenly started working because  _ 
A. they saw a stranger in the office 
B. they had finished their morning break 
C. no one wanted to talk to Marie 
D. the boss was about to arrive

One morning, Mr. Green sat at table and had breakfast. Mrs. Green asked him,""Why do you always talk in your sleep?""Mr. Green said,""Because I have few chances to talk in the daytime ""
The next morning after their children all went to school, Mrs. Green asked Mr. Green angrily,""Why did you scold me in your sleep last night?""""Because I'm afraid to do it when I'm awake .""

Context: The professor stood before his class of 30 senior biology students, about to pass out the final exam. ""I have been honored to be your teacher this term, and I know how hard you have all worked to prepare for this test. I also know most of you are off to medical school or graduate school next fall,"" he said to them.
""I can well understand how much pressure you are under to keep your grades up, and because I know you are able to understand this material, I am prepared to offer an automatic  ""B"" to anyone who would prefer not to take the final.""
In relief a number of students jumped up to thank the professor and left the class. The professor looked at the students who remained, and offered again, ""Any other takers? This is your last chance."" One more student decided to go.
There were seven students left. The professor closed the door. Then he handed out the final exam. There were only two sentences typed on the paper: ""Congratulations, you have just received an ""A"" in this class. Keep believing in yourself.""
I never had a professor who gave a test like that. It may seem like the easy way out of grading   a lot of exams, but it's a test that any teacher in any subject could and should give. Students who don't have confidence in what they've learned are ""B"" students at best.
The same is true for students of real life. The ""A"" students are those who believe in what they're doing because they've learned from both successes and failures. They have learned life's lessons, whether from formal education or the school of hard knocks, and become better people.
Take your cue  from Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person to reach the top of Mount Qomolangma: ""It's not the mountain we conquer  , but ourselves."" Don't let the biggest limit be yourself. 
 Question:According to the text, which of the following statements is TRUE? 
A. 22 students got a ""B"" in the final test without doing the paper. 
B. Most of the students would go to medical school shortly after the exam. 
C. There were actually no problems on the test papers for the students to work out. 
D. The way the professor tested his students would not be suitable for other subjects. 
 Answer: C
Context: It was the last day of the final exam in a college. Outside the classroom, a group of students were waiting for the last exam. On their faces was confidence.
They knew the exam would be easy. The teacher said they could bring any books or notes during the test.
Right after they came into the classroom. The teacher handed out the papers. There were only five questions on it.
Three hours passed. Then the teacher began to collect the papers. The students no longer looked _ but they looked very nervous. The teacher watched these worried faces, and then asked. ""How many of you finished all five questions?"" No one answered. ""How many of you answered four?"" Still no one put up the hand. ""Three? Two?"" The students moved restlessly in their seats. ""One, then? Certainly somebody finished one."" But the class kept silent . The teacher said, ""That is what I thought. I just want to make you know clearly that you finished four years of study, but there are still many things about the subject you don't know. These questions you could not answer are common  in everyday life."" Then, he smiled and said ""You will all pass this exam, but it doesn't mean that you learned the subject well. There are still more things for you to learn in your later life.""
Now we can't remember the name of this teacher clearly, but we can't forget the lesson he taught us. 
 Question:.Why did the students think the exam was easy at first? 
A. Because it was their last exam in the college. 
B. Because they knew there were only five questions.

Context: So many of us expect everything we do to be successful. We look forward to success to show us our value or to be the top of the group wherever we are. How many times in our schooling did we hope for a high mark? We want it and then feel like a failure when we don't achieve what we want. Even when we succeed we still pass that and go onto the next success and then the next. We are not often taught how to face failures.
For me, failure taught me more than success did. Success is of the moment and temporary but failure means we have ever done. It makes me stop and think. It opened my eyes and brain to different possibilities. Failure is just a choice in redoing not in giving up. Experiencing failure,I looked deeper and further.
I have a grandson who plays hockey  and as all players do,he went through a _ . So I saw he was unhappy with himself. Then I said to him, ""Why don't you think of it differently rather than being unhappy?"" And I asked, ""Scoring is your goal, right?"" He answered,""Of course."" ""Why aren't you scoring now? Do you need a readjustment ?""All of a sudden he calmed down--he was thinking of what I had just said. So in the next game I saw him trying different things to do better. Later he started scoring. Now when something is wrong, he takes the time to think it over rather than just keeping the ""failure"" mode .
Look at failure differently. Failure is what gives us power to try a different way of doing things.
It teaches us to rethink, redo, and then success will come about. Don't give up but learn to use a different way. 
 Question:Which is the best title for the text? 
A. Expect Success. 
B. Face Failures Differently. 
C. My Grandson and I. 
D. Keep Failure Mode.

Context: Being able to count at least ten people as friends makes us happy, but those with five or fewer are likely to be miserable, researchers say. Their study of hundreds of men and women also found t hat people who feel satisfied with their lives always have lots of close friends and regularly make new ones. While it is not clear whether our friends make us happy or we make friends because we are happy, the researchers say it is clear that we should maintain our friendships. Psychologist RichardTunney said, ""Whatever the reason is, actively working on friendships in the same way as to maintain a marriage is a prerequisite  to happiness. ""Dr. Tunney, of Nottingham University, quizzed more than 1,700 people about their satisfaction  with their lives and the state of their friendships. Those with five friends or fewer had just a 40 percent chance of being happy.  In other words they were more likely to be unhappy than happy. Ten was the first number at which people were more likely to be happy than unhappy. The happiest people were those with dozens of friends, according to the study, which was carried out for the National Lottery .
For women, this meant having 33 friends;for men, the number was 49. Dr. Tunney said,""People who were extremely satisfied with their lives had twice the number of friends of people  who were extremely dissatisfied. "" Women tended to have fewer friends than men but formed tighter relationships. Interestingly, the study found that childhood friends are no more likely to make us happy than people we become close to later in life. Lottery winners, however, have a differentopinion on life. They are always happier than others despite spending their time with asmall circle of old friends. This could be because they trust people they've known for along time. 
 Question:What's the best title for this passage?

C. Why Most People Like to Make Friends Regularly

Context: I'm telling Mother about a new girl in school,and she suddenly looks up and says,""Who're your two best friends?"" I'm not sure what to say.I've been friends with Jill since I was three or so,and I really like Jaime,a friend in kindergarten.""Well,what about Karen and Cindy?"" She seems upset,like I hurt her feelings.""But they're my sisters."" ""Yes,but they can still be your best friends.Friends may come and go,but your sisters will always be there for you.""
At the time,the idea of my two sisters being my closest friends seemed strange to me.We fought all the time over toys,food and attention.How could my sisters be my best friends?They weren't the same age as I.We all had our own friends in school.But my mother never let the three of us forget it:Sisters are lifelong friends.Her wish was to give us something that she never had.Growing up an only child,she longed for siblings  .When she gave birth to three daughters,the fulfillment of her dream had only just begun.She'd given us each a gift and she wanted to make sure we did not take that gift for granted.She'd frequently tell us how lucky we were.She never showed favoritism to one daughter over the other.And when we were teenagers,Mom always punished us equally.
We didn't always get along beautifully and fought just like any other siblings.But we realized that our mother was right.Today I share things with my sisters that I do with no one else.My sister Cindy and I ran the New York City Marathon together,sidebyside,even holding hands when we crossed the finish line.When my sister Karen got married,I was her maid of honor.The three of us trust each other with our greatest secrets.
It was twentythree years ago that my mother first asked me who my two best friends were.Today she doesn't have to.She already knows.

Context: Happiness is contagious  , as researchers reported on Thursday.
People with the most social connections -- spouses, friends, neighbors and relatives -- were also the happiest, the data showed. ""Each additional happy person makes you happier,"" Christakis said.
""Imagine that I am connected to you and you are connected to others and others are connected to still others. It is this fabric of humanity, like an American patch quilt.""
Each person sits on a different colored patch. ""Imagine that these patches are happy and unhappy patches. Your happiness depends on what is going on in the patch around you,"" Christakis said.
""It is not just happy people connecting with happy people, which they do. Above and beyond, there is this contagious process going on.""
And happiness is more contagious than unhappiness, they discovered.
""If a social contact is happy, it increases the likelihood that you are happy by 15 percent, "" Fowler said. ""A friend of a friend, or the friend of a spouse or a sibling  , if they are happy, increases your chances by 10 percent,"" he added.
A happy third degree friend -- the friend of a friend of a friend -- increases a person's chances of being happy by 6 percent.
""But every extra unhappy friend increases the likelihood that you'll be unhappy by 7 percent,"" Fowler said.
The finding is interesting and it is useful, too, Fowler said.
""Among other benefits, happiness has been shown to have an important effect on reduced mortality  , pain reduction, and improved cardiac   function. So better understanding of how happiness spreads can help us learn how to develop a healthier society,"" he said.
The study also fits in with other data suggested in 1984 that having $ 5,000 extra increased a person's chances of becoming happier by about 2 percent.
""A happy friend is worth about $ 20,000,"" Christakis said. 
 Question:Which of the following will increase your chances of becoming happier most? 
A. Being in a party with a happy atmosphere. 
B. A happy experience of your brother or your parents. 
C. A happy trip to a foreign country of your friends.

Context: It was a long process that involved creating a resume, submitting an online application  and attending a round of interviews. Naturally Tan Kaiyin, a 21-year-old student is excited when she was selected, as more than 660, 000 people signed up to volunteer at the 16thAsian Games in Guangzhou, but only less than 10 percent were finally chosen to work in the venues and wear the white and green sport uniforms.
Like in any major sporting event, volunteers play a vital role in assisting with operations and Tan's function here is not any different. She is based at the Garden Hotel and is tasked with helping guests and officials who have issues with their accreditation cards . ""I deal with guests from all over the world, I have never met so many international people and it is very, very exciting to have this opportunity to interact with them. They come to the office because they need to make a change in their accreditation card and usually they are in a hurry, so we try our best to get it done quickly."" 
She admits the first few days involved extremely long hours, however she likes the challenge as it gives her an immense sense of satisfaction especially when an irate guest turns a frown into a smile and says ""thank you"". 
Tan deals with people from different cultures and personalities and feels she has learned so much in the past week, an experience that she would have never gotten if not for the Guangzhou Asian Games, therefore she is very happy and grateful for being a part of this. She also has kind words for her managers and fellow colleagues and says the hard work and positive atmosphere has bonded them into a family. She enjoys her responsibilities so much that she is afraid of feeling lost when the Games finally end on Nov. 27. 
However, she is aware of all the positive effects the Games have had on Guangzhou. From improvements to air and water quality to better transportation and infrastructure in the city, but most importantly to her is the fact that the Asian Games has placed Guangzhou prominently onto the world map. This, she believes, will encourage people from all over the world to continue visiting her city, and this in turn will give the residents of Guangzhou a fantastic opportunity to continue learning about different cultures. The official Asian Games Volunteer Slogan is, ""Together, we can make it better!"" Indeed it seems they can. 
 Question:In Tan's opinion, what is NOT the positive effects the Games have had on Guangzhou 
A. Improvements of air and water quality and better transportation 
B. Asian Games has place Guangzhou prominently onto the world map. 
C. The Game will give the residents of Guangzhou a fantastic opportunity to continue learning about different cultures. 
D. It disturbs people's normal life who are living in Guangzhou.

Context: After I made it to the city center, I started to feel it might be easy for a foreigner to deal with the great size of Beijing. With growing confidence, I decided to take the subway to the hotel, not realizing that the network didn't go that far. Impressed with the cleanliness of the station, I bought a ticket and boarded the first train that came along.
After a few minutes I asked in English of course a young man seated next to me where I should get off closest to the Friendship Hotel. Wearing a smart business suit and tie, he would surely speak English, wouldn't he? Unfortunately, he couldn't understand me but seemed very friendly. I showed him the room card with all the information of the Friendship Hotel in Chinese characters. He looked at it, and then his eyes moved quickly to the carriage   subway map. Next, he raised three fingers of his right hand.
In Australia, raising fingers at someone is not usually nice, but this man wasn't smiling. At the next station he showed me two fingers. Now in   Australia, that's really rude, but I got the message. When we stopped at the third station, he didn't just point to the door, but got up, took me out of the train, and led me to the top of the stairs, and out onto the street. Then he stopped a taxi and told the driver where to take me.
All this came from a man who couldn't speak my language, and I couldn't speak his. I was now speechless, especially when he refused my offer of money. I felt a little embarrassed having even thought he would accept a tip.
This experience made it clear I had to learn some Chinese quickly or my adventures might start turning into bad luck.

Context: A mouse looked through a crack  in the wall to see the farmer and his wife opening a package; what food might it contain? He was astonished to discover that it was a mouse trap!
Running to the farmyard, the mouse shouted, warning everyone, ""There is a mouse trap in the house, there is a mouse trap in the house.""
The chicken, with her head high, glared at the mouse and said, ""Shut up. Little Ugly. This is a great concern to you, but it has nothing to do with me; I can't be troubled by it.

Context: Busy as I am every day, I always open my computer and check my email. Most of the time I am simply doing finger exercises, another form of piano practice without beautiful tones. Sometimes, however, I receive a gift, reminding me of the gifts in my life. The following passage is one of those gifts.
Peter Jones is a 92-year-old, short, calm and proud man. Every morning he is fully dressed by eight o'clock, with his hair fashionably combed and face perfectly shaved even though hi is unable to see anything. He would move to a nursing home today. His wife of 70 years old has recently passed away, making the move necessary.
After hours of waiting patiently in the entrance hall of the nursing home, he smiled sweetly when told his room was ready. As he moved his walking stick skillfully to the elevator, the nurse provided a visual description of his tiny room. ""I love it,"" he stated with enthusiasm. ""Mr. Jones, you haven't been the room,"" said the nurse.
""That doesn't have anything to do with it,"" he replied. ""Happiness is something you decide on ahead of time. Whether I like my room or not doesn't depend on how the furniture is arranged...it's how I arrange my mind. I have already decided to love _ It's a decision I make every morning when I wake up. I have a choice: I can spend the day in bed complaining of the difficulty I have with the parts of my body that no longer work, or get out of bed and be thankful for the ones that do.""
Each day is a gift, and as long as we are alive. We'll focus on the new day and all the happy memories we've stored just as Mr. Jones does.

You've been with us for a long time. I won't forget all the pain you've caused for us.
Do you remember the night you almost took my father's life? I do. He loves you. Sometimes I think he loves you more than he loves me. He's addicted to you, to the way you promise to rid him of his problems only to cause more of them. You just sat back and laughed as his car went spinning through the street, crashing into two other cars. He wasn't the only one hurt by you that night.
Do you remember the night of my first high school party? You were there. My friends were _ by you. They treated you as if they were never going to see you again, drinking all of you that they could. I spent two hours that night helping my friends who had fallen completely. ""I'm so embarrassed,"" they said as I held their hair back so that they could vomit  . ""I'm sorry,"" they said when I called taxies for them, walking them out and paying the driver in advance. ""This won't happen again,"" they said as they were sent to the hospital to have their stomachs pumped  . Two 15-year-old girls slept in hospital beds that night thanks to you.
Do you remember the night when you took advantage of my 17-year-old neighbor who had to drive to pick up his sister from her dance lessons? Do you know how we all felt when he hit another car and killed the two people in the other car? He died the next morning too. His sister walked home from her dance lesson, and passed police cars and a crowd of people gathering on the sidewalk just two blocks away from the dance studio. She didn't realize her brother was in the midst of it all. She never saw him again. And it's all your fault.
I wish you'd walk out of my life forever. I don't want anything to do with you. Look at all the pain you've caused. Sure, you've made people happy too from time to time. But the damage you've caused in the lives of millions is inexcusable. Stop luring in the people I love. Stop hurting me, please.

Context: Peter waved goodbye and closed the door slowly as Jane left home to visit her grandmother. Expecting a whole day to relax, he was thinking whether to read the newspaper or watch his favorite TV talk show on his first day off in months. ""This will be like a walk in the park,"" he'd told his wife, ""I'll look after the kids, and you can go to visit your grandma.""
Things started well, but just after eight o'clock, his three little ""good kids""--Adam, Bob, and Christopher--came down the stairs in their night clothes and shouted ""breakfast, daddy."" When food had not appeared within thirty seconds, Adam began using his spoon on Christopher's head as if it were a drum. Christopher started to shout loudly in time to the beat  . Bob chanted ""Where's my toast, where's my toast"" in the background. Peter realized his newspaper would have to wait for a few seconds.
Life became worse after breakfast. Adam wore Bob's underwear on his head. Bob locked himself in the bathroom, while Christopher shouted again because he was going to wet his pants. Nobody could find clean socks, although they were before their very eyes. Someone named ""Not Me"" had spilled a whole glass of orange juice into the basket of clean clothes. Peter knew the talk show had already started.
By ten o'clock, things were out of control. Christopher was wondering why the fish in the jar refused his bread and butter. Adam was trying to show off his talent by decorating the kitchen wall with his color pencils. Bob, thankfully, appeared to be reading quietly in the family room, but closer examination showed that he was eating apple jam straight from the bottle with his hands. Peter realized that the talk show was over and reading would be impossible.
At exactly 11:17, Peter called the daycare centre  .""I suddenly have to go into work and my wife's away. Can I bring the boys over in a few minutes?"" The answer was obviously ""yes"" because Peter was smiling.

Context: In May, 2014, some Chinese tourists found a Chinese-character message ""Ding Jinhao once visited here"" on a statue of god in a 3500-year-old Egyptian temple. An angry tourist took the photograph of the scrawl and posted it on social media Sina Weibo. It was quickly spread and there were more than 100,000 comments during two weeks. Later, a 15-year-old Chinese boy was searched out as the person who caved this message. Many netizens expressed their anger and disappointment for the uncivilized behavior. They searched and identified the boy and then posted his personal information including the address and pictures online.
Over the weekend, his school's website was hacked, and reporters flooded into his home in the city of Nanjing. Besieged by reporters, the child's mother offered a formal apology for her son's behavior. ""We want to apologize to the Egyptian people and to people who have paid attention to this case across China."" the boy's mother told the local newspaper.
With China's economy booming over the past decades, a growing number of the country's residents have become global tourists. Earlier this month, Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang addressed: ""Uncivilized behavior of some of tourists is giving this country a bad reputation abroad."" The discussion about Chinese quality was carried out on many media.
On the bright side, Egypt government described the damage to the temple as superficial and could be restored and they would forgive the boy. While the act of Ding Jinhao symbolizes a national shame, meanwhile, many people concern about the child's development and wish he could return to anonymity once more. ""The boy has known his mistake and cried all night. He has to be moved around because reporters rushes to his house for interviews."" said a reporter who talked with the parents. 
 Question:The writer uses the quotation by Vice Premier Wang Yang to show   _  . 
A. Chinese people are influential 
B. China is a civilized country 
C. People shouldn't go abroad 
D. Some misconducts are bad for our image

Context: Smog is a big problem in many Chinese cities. But it seems that besides wearing a mask, few of us know what has caused the smog and what to do to beat it. Chai Jing, a former news interviewer with CCTV, discussed the questions in her documentary Under the Dome.
The 103-minute film was on websites on Feb 28. In the film, Chai visits polluted places and talks to officials and scientists. She thinks that burning too much coal and oil are the main causes of PM2.5 and smog.
To solve the problem, Chai suggests that we should clean our coal and oil or replace them with cleaner energy such as natural gas.
In her film, Chai also emphasized   that everyone can do something to help control smog too. For example, we can live a greener life by using more public transport. Or if we see things that could harm the environment, we can try to stop it. In the film, when she sees a restaurant cooking without any suitable filter facilities  , she calls the hotline 12369. The restaurant installed the filter a week later.
Chen Jining, the new minister of environmental protection, praised Chai. ""This film encourages ordinary people to take notice of the environment. This is what we need in the future."" 
 Question:Which of the following is NOT included in Chai's suggestions towards reducing smog? 
A. Using cleaner energy. 
B. Cleaning coal and oil. 
C. Using public transport. 
D. Replacing coal with wind energy.

Context: The newspaper must provide for the reader the facts, pure, unprejudiced , objectively selected facts. But in these days the complex news it must provide more; it must supply explanation, the meaning of the facts. This is the most important assignment facing American journalism--to make clear to the reader the problems of the day, to make international news understandable as community news, to recognize that there is no longer any such thing(with the possible exception of society news)as ""local"" news, because any event in the international area has local reaction in the financial market, political circles, indeed, of our very way of life. There is in journalism a widespread view that when you consider giving an explanation, you are entering dangerous water, the swirling tides of opinion. This is nonsense.
The opponents of explanation insist that the writer and the editor shall confine himself to the ""facts"". This insistence raises two questions; What are the facts? And are the bare facts enough? As for the first question, consider how a so-called ""factual"" story comes about. The reporter collects, say, fifty facts; out of these fifty, his space being necessarily restricted, he selects the ten that he considers most important. This is Judgment Number One. Then he or his editor decides which of these ten facts shall constitute the beginning of the article. (this is an important decision because many readers do not proceed beyond the first paragraph) This is Judgment Number Two. Then. The night editor decides whether the article shall be presented on page one, where it has a large influence, or on page twenty-four, where it has little. Judgment Number Three.
Thus in the show of a so-called ""factual"" of ""objective"" story, at least three judgments are involved. And they are judgments mot at all unlike those involved in explanation, in which reporter and editor, calling upon their research resources , their general background, and their ""news neutralism"" , arrive at a conclusion as to the importance of the news.
The two areas of judgment, presentation of the news and its explanation, are both objective rather than subjective processes--as objective, that is, as any human being can be. (Note in passing; even though complete objectivity can never be achieved, nevertheless the ideal must always be the light in the murky news channels) If an editor is intern on giving a prejudiced view of the news, he can do it in other ways and more effectively than by explanation. He can do it by the selection of those facts that support his particular viewpoint. Or he can do it by the play he gives a story promoting it to page one or putting it on page thirty.

A. Function of the Night Editor

Context: Several weeks ago, kidsPost did a story on ""The Art of Video Games"" at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The exhibition has created debate with some people saying that as fun as video games are ,they are not works of art. Other people say that videos games may be a new form of art and that they belong to in museums. We asked readers for their opinions on the topic. Here are a few of the letters we received.
A video game is like a painting on a screen. In order to make a video game, you have to think of something original to reach the players. This is the point of Art.
---Mary Pottanat,13
I believe video games are not a form of art. Art should be a visual  and creative expression of feelings. Although it is arguable that video games are visual ,they do not express feelings in any way.
---Prannab Kirshnan,12
However exciting video games are, they are not art. Painting is art, but not video games. Art has beauty and culture that no technology could ever compare to. Even though you can create art in some video games, the "" Mona Lisa"" wasn't painted with Nintendo.
---Caroline Kaplan,10
Art is a way of communicating ideas to the public in a way that is fun to them.

The old man's granddaughter is very surprised ,but she thanks the policemen and they leave.
""But my grandfather,"" the granddaughter asks, ""You go to the park every day for twenty years. How can't you find your way home ?""
The old man smiles, ""I'm just tired and don't want to walk home.""

Context: It was a lovely day at the park and Stella Bianchi was enjoying the sunshine with her two children when a young boy, aged about four, approached her two-year-old son and pushed him to the ground.
""I'd watched him for a little while and my son was the fourth or fifth child he'd pushed,"" she says. ""I went over to them, picked up my son, turned to the boy and said, firmly, 'No, we don't push.'"" What happened next was unexpected.
""The boy's mother ran toward me from across the park,"" Stella says, ""I thought she was coming over to apologize, but instead she started shouting at me for blaming her child. All I did was let him know his behavior was unacceptable. Was I supposed to sit back while her kid did whatever he wanted and hurt other children?""
Getting your own children to play nice is difficult enough. Dealing with other people's children has become a hidden danger.
In my house, jumping on the sofa is not allowed. In my sister's house it's encouraged. I find myself saying ""no"" a lot when her kids are over at mine. That's OK between sisters but becomes dangerous when you're talking to the children of friends or acquaintances.
""Kids aren't all raised the same,"" agrees Professor Naomi White of Monash University."" But there is still an idea that they're the property of the parent. We see our children as a mirror of ourselves, so if you're saying that my child is behaving improperly, then that's somehow a criticism  of me.""
In those situations, it's difficult to know whether to approach the child directly or the parent first. There are two opinions.
""I'd go to the child first,"" says Andrew Fuller, author of Tricky Kids. ""Usually a quiet reminder that 'we don't do that here' is enough. Kids have antennae   for how to behave in different settings.""
He points out bringing it up with the parent first may make them feel careless, which could cause problems. Of course, approaching the child first can bring its own headaches, too.
This is why White recommends that you approach the parents first. Raise your concerns with the parents and ask them to deal with it,"" she says.
Asked how to approach a parent in this situation, psychologist Meredith Fuller answers: ""Explain your needs as well as stressing the importance of the friendship. Start with something like: 'I know you'll think I'm silly but in my house I don't want...'"" 
 Question:What should one do when seeing other people's kids misbehave according to Andrew Fuller? 
A. Talk to them directly in a mild way 
B. Complain to their parents politely 
C. Simply leave them alone 
D. Punish them lightly

Context: Several overseas trips with the family have taught us that they can be rewarding, but you always have to be careful of pickpockets.
On a lovely visit to Paris an encounter with a pickpocket gave the would-be thief a little more than he _ 
While walking down the famous Champs Elysee, I was astonished to feel someone unzip my handbag and remove my purse. I turned to glimpse a young man turning away and pretending to be absorbed in the mouth-watering contents on display in a bakery window.
Being only a teenager at the time, I had no idea what to do. So I tapped the young man in question on the shoulder and said.
""Excuse me can you please give me back my purse?""
Of course the pickpocket had no idea what I was saying (and didn't want to know) and proceeded to shrug his shoulders and basically say (in French) ""I don't speak English""?
Meanwhile my Mother (a Scotswoman with a bad temper), came to see why I had stopped walking and what was going on. When I informed her of the situation she lost control and started yelling at the thief who still stood there making gestures in French while a crazy Scotswoman harangued  him. At this stage we were starting to attract onlookers, and when my Mother started hitting the young man with her handbag the would-be thief decided it was time to get away.
Luckily, amid all the disorder the thief lost his control of my purse, and as he made a break-for-it, my purse dropped to the ground! I quickly snatched it up and for the rest of vacation we walked around with our handbags clutched against our chests! 
 Question:This passage is a story about  _  . 
A. several overseas trips 
B. Champs Elysee 
C. a lovely visit to Paris 
D. pickpockets

Context: One day, when I was in college, a dishonest-looking character approached me in the student union with a leather jacket he wanted to sell. It was a beauty: buttery smooth cowskin, with artfully sewed lines and long leather fringes  .
I can't remember what the price was, but it was apparently too little for such a jacket. Even as I paid the money that day, I knew something wasn't right. Surely, a couple of days later, the jacket's real owner, a student about my age came to me as I was on my way to class.
""That's my jacket,"" he said, ""and I want it back.""
""No way,"" I answered. ""I paid for it, and I have no idea if it's yours. It's mine.""
He didn't challenge me, and I left, but the uneasiness  I had about my new possession now _ A few days later, riding my bike across campus, I saw the real owner standing on the sidewalk. I rode over, took the jacket off, handed it to him said I was sorry, and rode off without another word. More than the weight of the jacket had been lifted from my shoulders.
We're all human, which means that sometimes we do things we shouldn't do or say things we shouldn't say. Sometimes we realize too late that our actions have been hurtful to somebody else. When these hard times occur, the best response --- the only response, really --- is, ""I'm sorry.""
Admitting a wrongdoing, as soon as possible and frankly, helps the other person begin to heal. But just as important, it cleans up our own soul and sets us free.
That is a small price to pay for a clear conscience.

B. might be clearly expressed 
C. began to give me away openly

Context: In order to save money for a trip to Thailand to visit her family and friends, Emma White, a keeper in California, worked overtime. She saved more than 900 dollars and was planning to buy a ticket, but she lost her purse with all her money and credit cards .
Emma looked through the garbage  and all the buildings where she worked but came up empty-handed. She went home heartbroken. She believed that she had lost her money forever. While Emma was at home, sad and depressed, a homeless man was searching through the garbage looking for things to sell. As he was looking through a garbage bag, he found something wrapped in a plastic bag.
The homeless man, who did not want to be recognized, took the purse to Sherry Wesley, because Sherry Wesley knew him from her volunteer work at a homeless shelter. The homeless man came to Sherry Wesley with the wad of money and said, ""This probably belongs to someone that you work with; can you find the owner?""

In one of the experiments, happy and sad participants were asked to judge whether some wrong things were true or not. The results showed that people in a bad mood were less likely to believe that these things were true.
People in a bad mood were also less likely to make mistakes when they were asked to remember the things that they saw.
The study also showed that sad people were better at talking about their thoughts in written style. In fact, the study said that a slightly bad mood could help to make communication more successful. 
 Question:Being sad is good for the following except   _  . 
A. one's judgment 
B. one's diet 
C. one's memory 
D. one's communication

Context: I called a meeting with the parents of my student, Tommy. I wanted to talk with them about his schoolwork and behaviour .Tommy was always an excellent student. How could I make his father and mother believe that their recent separation  made his grades bad.?
Tommy's mother came in and sat down. Then his father arrived. But they didn't say even one word to each other. I told them about Tommy's schoolwork and behaviour. I hoped to help them see what they were doing to their son. But it looked that my words didn't work. I thought that maybe Tommy could tell them something himself.
I found Tommy's paper in the back of his desk. Tommy has written some words on it many times. I gave the paper to Tommy's mother. She read it and gave it to his father. He read it and his face became soft . He reached for his wife's hand. She smiled up at him. My eyes were with tears. He helped her with her coat and they left together.
I picked the paper up and looked at it again. It read: ""Dear Mommy... Dear Daddy... I love you.""

Context: ""Did you hear what happened to Adam last Friday?"" Lindsey whispers to Tori.
With her eyes shining, Tori brags, ""You bet I did. Sean told me two days ago.""
What are Lindsey and Tori talking about? It just happens to be yours truly, Adam Freedman. I can tell you that what they are saying is (a) not nice and (b) not even true. Still, Lindsey and Tori aren't very different from most students here at Linton High School, including me. Many of our conversations are gossip . I have noticed three effects of gossip: it can hurt people, it can give gossipers a strange kind of satisfaction, and it can cause social pressures in a group.
An important negative effect of gossip is that it can hurt the person being talked about. Usually, gossip spreads information about a topic--breakups, troubles at home, even dropping out--that a person would rather keep secret. The more embarrassing or shameful the secret is, the juicer the gossip it makes. Probably the worst type of gossip is the absolute lie. People often think of gossipers as harmless, bur cruel lies can cause pain.
If we know that gossip can be harmful, then why do so many of us do it? The answer lies in another effect of gossip: the satisfaction it gives us. Sharing the latest rumor can make a person feel important because he or she knows something that others don't. Similarly, hearing the latest rumor can make a person feel like part of the ""in group"". In other words, gossip is satisfying because it gives people a sense of belonging or even superiority .
Gossip can also have a third effect: it strengthens unwritten, unspoken rules about how people should act. Professor David Wilson explains that gossip is important in policing behaviors in a group. Translated into high school terms, this means that if everybody you hang around with is laughing at what John wore or what Jane said, then you can bet that wearing or saying something similar will get you the same kind of negative attention. The do's and don'ts conveyed through gossip will never show up in any student handbook.
The effects of gossip vary depending on the situation. The next time you feel the urge to spread the latest news, think about why you want to gossip and what effects your ""juicy story"" might have. 
 Question:What advice does the author give in the passage? 
A. Never become a gossiper. 
B. Stay away from gossipers. 
C. Don't let gossip turn into lies. 
D. Think twice before you gossip.

Context: Rome had the Forum  . London has Speaker's Corner. Now always-on-the-go New Yorkers have Liz and Bill.
   Liz and Bill, two college graduates in their early 20s, have spent a whole year trying to have thousands of people talk to them in subway stations and on busy street corners. And just talk.
   Using a 2-foot-tall sign that says, "" Talk to Me,"" they attract conversationalists, who one evening included a mental patient, and men in business suits.
   They don't collect money. They don't push religion  . So what's the point?
   "" To see what happens,"" said Liz. "" We simply enjoy life with open talk.""
   Shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks, they decided to walk from New York City to Washington, a 270-mile trip. They found they loved talking to people along the way and wanted to continue talking with strangers after their return.
   "" It started as a crazy idea."" Liz said. "" We were so curious about all the strangers walking by with their life stories. People will talk to us about anything: their job, their clothes, their childhood experiences, anything.""
   Denise wanted to talk about an exam she was about to take. She had stopped by for the second time in two days, to let the two listeners know how it went.
   Marcia had led her husband to a serious disease. ""That was very heavy on my mind."" Marcia said. "" To be able to talk about it to total strangers was very good,"" she explained.
   To celebrate a year of talking, the two held a get-together in a city park for all the people they had met over the past year. A few hundred people appeared, as well as some television cameramen and reporters.
   They may plan more parties or try to attract more people to join their informal talks. Some publishers have expressed interest in a book, something the two say they'll consider before making a decision. 
 Question:What did Liz and Bill determine to do after the attack on September 11, 2001?

Before they set off, they looked around in the car for useful things to take with them. One of the men took a bottle of whisky. Another took an umbrella. The third unscrewed a door from the car and carried that.
After they had been walking for almost a day, they came across a camel caravan travelling towards them.
""Let's try to join the caravan,"" one of the men said. ""It's going the wrong way but we'll be safer than if we keep on alone across the desert.""
The other s agreed, so they asked the leader of the caravan for permission to join it.
""You can join the caravan only if you answer three questions,"" he said. He pointed to the first man's bottle. ""What is that and why are you carrying it?"" he asked.
""It's a bottle of whisky. I decided to carry it with me so that if I feel miserable and want to give up, I can get drunk, cheer myself up and then keep on walking.""
""Very sensible,"" the leader of the caravan said. Then he pointed to the next man and his umbrella.
""It hasn't rained in the desert for many years,"" he said. ""Why are you carrying an umbrella?""
""I don't want to get heat exhaustion,"" he replied. ""The umbrella will give me shade from the sun.""
""Very sensible,"" the leader of the caravan said. He pointed to the third man and his car door. ""And why are you carrying a car door?"" he asked him.

Actors and camera men work from very early in the morning until late at night. Each scene has to be acted and re-acted, filmed and re-filmed, until it is just fine.

Context: A new term might be the best time to make new friends, but it can be hard to begin the first conversation. Below are four useful ways. Take a look.
Search for common interests. Talking about shared interests, such as sports and popular talent shows, is the easiest way to make a successful talk with someone.
Welcome the silence. In fact, sometimes silence is needed in order to continue a conversation. Remember that if you say something, the other person may need time to understand it.
Keep it positive . To make great small talk, you should keep things fun. You should be cheerful and able to laugh over things that aren't very interesting. These will make the other person want to keep talking to you.
Take it as a learning experience. Every time you meet someone from other places, it's a good chance to learn something new. You can learn more about their cultures and nations. These make you a more interesting person to talk to as well. 
 Question:How many ways are mentioned to start a conversation in the reading? 
A. Only one. 
B. Three. 
C. Four. 
D. Five.

Context: We all have our own ways of sharing our life experiences with others.
Photographers use cameras, artists use brushes, musicians use songs and writers use stories.
Spencer Johnson's story Who Moved My Cheese? shows changes exist in our life. Life changes and so we do. We must change ourselves to face the changing environment, or we will fail.
Just look at the cycle of the seasons. Trees bud in spring and in summer their leaves turn green. In autumn, their leaves start to fall onto the ground. When winter comes, there are no leaves on trees. Next spring the cycle begins again. Since we know there are cycles in nature, we can prepare for them. We know it is colder in winter and hotter in summer, so we can dress properly.
Since we accept the cycles of nature, we should also accept the changes in our life.
We can prepare ourselves for changes by becoming more flexible . We can regard the changes in our life as chances. As we keep changing ourselves, we can keep up with the changes in our life. 
 Question:The cycle of the seasons means   _  . 
A. we should wear warm clothes in winter

C. we should prepare for the weather

Context: One day Marilla said, ""Anne, your new teacher, Miss Stacy, spoke to me yesterday. She says you must study for the examinations for Queen's College in two years' time. Then if you do well, you can study at Queen's in Charlottetown for a year, and after that you'll be a teacher!""
""That doesn't matter, Anne. When Matthew and I adopted you three years ago, we decided to look after you as well as we could. Of course we'll pay for you to study.""So in the afternoons Anne and some of her friends stayed late at school, and Miss Stacy helped them with the special examination work. Diana didn't want to go to Queen's, so she went home early, but Gilbert stayed. He and Anne still never spoke and everybody knew that they were enemies, because they both wanted to be first in the examination. Secretly, Anne was sorry that she and Gilbert weren't friends, but it was too late now.
For two years, Anne studied hard at school. She enjoyed learning, and Miss Stacy was pleased with her. But she didn't study all the time. In the evenings and at weekends she visited her friends, or walked through the fields with Diana, or sat talking to Matthew.
""Your Anne is a big girl now. She's taller than you,"" Rachel Lynde told Marilla one day.
""You're right, Rachel!"" said Marilla in surprise.
""And she's a very good girl now, isn't she? She doesn't get into trouble these days. I'm sure she helps you a lot with the housework, Marilla.""
""Yes, I don't know what I'd do without her,"" said Marilla, smiling.
""And look at her! Those beautiful grey eyes, and that red-brown hair! You know, Marilla, I thought you and Matthew made a mistake when you adopted her. But now I see I was wrong. You've looked after her very well.""
""Well, thank you, Rachel,"" replied Marilla, pleased.
That evening, when Matthew came into the kitchen, he saw that his sister was crying.
""What's the matter?"" he asked, surprised. ""You haven't cried since... well, I can't remember when.""
""It's just... well, I was thinking about Anne,"" said Marilla. ""I'll...I'll miss her when she goes away.""
""When she goes to Queen's, you mean? Yes, but she can come home at weekends, on the train.""
""I'll still miss her,"" said Marilla sadly.""
In June the Avonlea boys and girls had to go to Charlottetown to take their examinations.
""Oh, I do hope that I've done well,"" Anne told Diana when she arrived back at Green Gables. ""The examinations were very difficult. And I've got to wait for three weeks before I know! Three weeks! I'll die!""
Anne wanted to do better than Gilbert. But she also wanted to do well for Matthew and Marilla. That was very important to her.
Diana was the first to hear the news, she ran into the kitchen at Green Gables and shouted, ""Look, Anne! It's in Father's newspaper! You're first... with Gilbert... out of all the students on the island! Oh, how wonderful!"" Anne took the paper with shaking hands, and saw her name, at the top of the list of two hundred. She could not speak.
""Well, now, I knew it,"" said Matthew with a warm smile.
""You've done well, I must say, Anne,"" said Marilla, who was secretly very pleased.

Context: The murmur of the audience had just faded into expectant silence. This was one of the most important days in little five-year-old Patricia McKee's life: the Kernot School Concert. She stood behind the curtain with her schoolmates. Yet she was not afraid because everyone had been practicing for weeks and knew their parts by heart.
Being in a remote country town, Patricia knew that everyone would turn out for the big occasion-everyone! Yet, it was this awareness that added a sense of sadness to her excitement. There were two people who couldn't be in that audience that night-her mum and dad.
Patricia's mother and father ran the local general store, which was open for business 24 hours. So it was simply accepted that Mum and Dad could never attend community activities. It had been this way with her sister, so why should it be any different for her?
Still, Patricia couldn't help wishing that her mum and dad could be there to see her on such a special day, so she decided to bring up the subject with her mother. Sadly, she had to face the facts. At such a young age, Patricia couldn't really understand the deep pain in her mother's response: ""I'll try to be there, sweetheart, but you know how hard it is for us to get away from the store.""
Yet as the curtain slowly opened on the stage of the Kernot Hall, little Patricia McKee got the surprise of her life. There, sitting four rows the front was her mother with a big smile on her face!
This powerful image remains one of Patricia's most treasured memories. ""Words cannot express the pure joy we both experienced at that moment. I was really _ ,"" said Patricia, now a parent herself. Her parents have passed away, but what a wonderful legacy they've left us: when someone really needs you, be there for them. 
 Question:Why did Patricia have a feeling of sadness? 
A. She had no chance to watch the concert. 
B. She performed unsuccessfully at the concert. 
C. Her parents had gone to a remote country town. 
D. Her parents were unlikely to attend the concert.

Context: Dad had a green comb  .He bought it when he married Mum. Every night,he would hand me his comb and say. ""Good girl, help Daddy clean it, OK?""
I was pleased to do it. At age five, this dull  task brought me such joy. I would excitedly turn the tap  on and brush the comb carefully. Satisfied that I'd done a good job. I would happily return the comb to Dad. He would smile affectionately  at me and place the comb on his wallet.
Two years later. Dad started his own business, which wasn't doing so well. That was when things started to change. Dad didn't come home as early and as much as he used to. Mum and I became mad with him for placing our family in trouble. With time, an uncomfortable silence grew between us.
After my graduation, Dad's business was getting back on track. On my 28th birthday. Dad came home early. As usual I helped him carry his bags into his study. When I turned to leave, he said,"" Hey, would you help me clean my comb?"" I looked at him a while,then took the comb and headed to the sink.

Late September she started her studies in a big hospital in Newcastle. She had to work very hard. She went to classes every day and studied late at night. Then a really important day came: her first day in a ward  . At last she was really helping sick people, not just sitting in classes or learning from books. 
At first, student nurses do lots of odd jobs in the ward. They help to serve meals, or wash the patients. They also keep the ward tidy and make the beds. But they cannot give injections or help the doctors. 
One of Alice's first jobs was in a ward of old people. She was told to clean all the patients' false teeth. She collected all the teeth and took them to the bathroom. Instead of cleaning each set of teeth one by one, she put them all into a big bowl. 
""It'll be quicker this way,"" she said to herself. ""Then I can give back everyone's teeth in a few minutes.""

Context: It was shortly before midnight, and Dr Patricia was getting ready for bed. The phone rang on the end of the line was a woman about to break a promise.
The woman was her mother's neighbour. Flora Harris had made the neighbour swear she wouldn't tell her daughter she'd a heart attack and was in the hospital, for fear her daughter would worry. The neighbour wisely decided to disobey orders.
Harris desperately wanted to get to the hospital immediately, but she couldn't. She lives in Washington, D.C, and her mother lives in California.
For the past year a half, Harris has gone to Los Angeles every other month to take care of her mother. Flora Harris takes care of her husband, James, who's 91 and has Alzheimer's disease. They live in their own home, and a caregiver comes to help them a few hours a day.
Harris is one of many Americans facing the heartache of how to take care of aging parents from afar. She's often worried, not to mention extremely busy with a demanding job, two teenage daughters and the frequent trips to California.
In some ways, Harris is lucky. She has the resources to make the trips to Los Angeles. Plus, Harris is a doctor who treats the elderly.
"" But it's still tough,"" she said. "" I can foresee what the next few years are going to look like, and it's not a pretty picture. My father's going to need diapers  . There will come a time when he won' t recognize me and he's easily excited. I worry he's going to be violent and hurt my mother.""
So what do you do when you live a continent away for your aging, sick parents? There are no magic answers. You can hire someone to help, but you can't _ it completely. 
 Question:What can we learn about Patricia Harris from the passage?

B. He parents cannot take themselves at all. 
C. She cannot do a demanding job. 
D. She cannot afford to go to California often.

Context: A daughter's duty? Adult daughters are often expected to caregiver for older parents. In 2007, Jorjan Sarich and her dad moved from California to Idaho. It was where he wanted to live his rest time.
""I left my occupation, I left my friends; he did the same thing,"" said Sarich, who bought a house with her father, George Snyder, in the China Gardens neighborhood of Hailey after his health began to decline. Though a graduate student struggling to finish her dissertation , Sarich chose to be her dad's full-time caregiver.
""It's only now, several years later, that I'm realizing how much work it was. It's the kind of exhaustion that sleep doesn't cure,"" she said.
About 6 million Americans provide care to elderly relatives or friends living outside of nursing homes. Laurel Kennedy, author of ""The Daughter Trap"" (Thomas Dunne Books, $25.95), says that women bear a disproportionate share of the burden -- about 70 percent of hands-on care giving such as bathing.
""I want to be clear: Women don't hate this,"" Kennedy said. ""What they hate is that everyone just assumes they'll do it.""
Kennedy is calling for _ equal to the rise of affordable child care and day care: Employers should help working caregivers by offering accommodations. Men should step up more often. It's unfair that women are always chosen to provide care for an elderly family member.
Despite the hard work it took on Sarich -- interrupted sleep and the knowledge that his 2009 death was the end game, she would do it again.

Context: An artist in Oakland, California is using his skills to help the homeless. Greg Kloehn builds very small shelters that make life on the streets more comfortable. The structures offer the homeless some safety and protection from bad weather. Each little house also has wheels on the bottom so it can go wherever its owner goes.
Greg Kloehn has given away at least 20 tiny houses to the homeless on the street. On a recent day, Mr. Kloehn stops to visit his homeless friends. One of them is Oscar Young. The two men hug when they see each other. Inside his little shelter Mr. Young gets relief from cold nights on the streets. Mr. Kloehn also visits Sweet-Pea, another friend who also lives in one of the little homes the artist built. She says it keeps her safe and protects her belongings.
In the mornings, Mr. Kloehn searches the streets for building materials. He gathers what he can and takes it to his studio. There, he puts the houses together. Empty coffee bags become roof material. A washing machine door and refrigerator part become windows. Nails, screws and the sticky glue hold all the pieces together. The artist also attaches a small electrical device  to the house. The device is powered by the sun.
Some of the people living on the streets once had normal houses of their own. But some of the people say they have learned to live with less and they are thankful to that man.
Mr. Kloehn says his work is not a social project. He says he is just someone using his skills to help his homeless neighbors.

Context: Many of us enjoy doing it: you turn on the camera on your mobile phone and hold it at a high angle--- making your eyes look bigger and your cheekbones more defined. You turn to your best side and click.
There it is - your selfie.
Over the past year, ""selfie"" has become a well-known term across the globe. This August the Oxford dictionary added the word to their online dictionary and define it as: ""A photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically with a smartphone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website.""
Today it's not difficult to find social networking pages full of photos people have taken of themselves and their friends. And selfie culture has become especially relevant for young people. As many as 91 percent of teenagers have posted photos of themselves online, according to a recent survey by the US Pew Research Center.
So what are the reasons for the rise of selfie culture?
""The craziness about the selfie celebrates regular people,"" Pamela Rutledge, a professor at the Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology, told Vogue magazine. ""There are many more photographs available now of real people than models.""
Posting selfies also allows you to control your image online. ""I like having the power to choose how I look, even if I'm making a funny face:' Samantha Barks, 19, a high school student in the US, told Vogue.
In addition to self-expression and documentation  , selfies ""allow for a close friendship for long-distance friends, because you can see each other's faces every day"", wrote Casey Miller at The Huffington Post.
But US psychologist Jill Weber is concerned that selfies might lead to social problems. ""There's a danger that your self-esteem   may start to be tied to the comments and '1ikes' you get when you post a selfie, and they aren't based on who you are - they're based on what you look like,"" Weber told Vogue. ""When you get nothing or a negative response, your confidence can decrease."" 
 Question:Many people post photos of themselves online to   _  . 
A. make fun of themselves 
B. become powerful 
C. beautify themselves 
D. choose how they look 
 Answer: D
Context: Canadian experts have found that so - called self - help books may actually do more harm than good to people who really need help.Researchers say that individuals   with low respect felt much worse after repeating positive statements about themselves.
In their study, psychologists Joanne Wood and John Lee sought to determine how positive thinking affected people with different levels of self - confidence.They questioned dozens of people both made and female, analyzed their self - worth and optimism by means of the standard psychological methods and then asked them to write down their thoughts and feelings.The scoring system ranged from 0 to 35.
During the experiment, the researchers asked a total of 68 participants to repeat the self-help book phrase, ""I am a lovable person."" After that they measured the participants' moods and their feelings about themselves.The results revealed that the participants in the low self - respect group who repeated the mantra  , were feeling much worse afterwards, when compared to other participants in low self - respect group who did not repeat the phrase.Those with low self - respect who repeated the phrase scored an average of 10 points.Their counterparts   with equally low self - respect who were not asked to repeat the statement, were able to score a little higher average of 17 points.
However, individuals with high self - respect reported feeling better after repeating the positive self - statement - but only slightly.They scored an average of 31 points, compared with an average of 25 for those with equally high self - respect who did not repeat the phrase.
Professor Wood urged those who promote self - help books, magazines and television shows to stop telling people that simply repeating a positive mantra could change one's life.First, people start following this idea and feel like they are not alone.They are told that all they have to do is just to read that book and then to repeat these positive statements in a hope that things will be better, and when it does not work for them and they realize that nothing gets better, then it is really frustration to people.
Researchers concluded: ""Repeating positive self - statements may benefit certain people such as individuals with high self - respect but discourage the very people who need confidence the most."" 
 Question:So - called self - help books do some good to  _  . 
A. people lacking confidence 
B. people with high self - respect 
C. people with problems to settle urgently 
D. people repeating positive self - statements 
 Answer: B
Context: You can do it!
That's a better way to motivate   yourself than saying ""I can do it, "" according to a new study that shows giving yourself advice and encouragement in the second-person before an upcoming task may actually improve your performance more than first-person self-talk.
""People are used to receiving and giving advice in the second-person, and they seem to prefer using the second-person pronoun to encourage themselves,"" says study co-author, Dr. Sanda Dolcos, a researcher at the University of Illinois. ""Self-advice expressed using 'You' probably enables people to have a broader perspective , consider how others might view the event, and reproduce the kind of encouragements previously received from others.""
For the study, Dr. Dolcos and her colleague, Dr. Dolores, asked 143 undergraduate students to write down advice to themselves before completing a series of puzzles. Half of the students were asked to use the first-person, while the others wrote in the second-person.
What did the researchers find? The students who wrote in the second-person managed to complete more puzzles and appeared to have a more positive attitude.
The researchers also asked the students to write down advice to themselves in relation to exercising more often in the next two weeks. Those who wrote in the second-person, again, reported a more positive attitude toward the task and even planned to do more exercise than the students who referred to themselves in the first-person.
""We were not surprised and had previous research showing that people _ use 'You' in situations that require high levels of self-control and action,"" Dolcos said.
But why did the researchers ask students to write down their self-talk instead of saying it out loud? "" Writing as a tool of conversing with oneself has long been used as a therapeutical approach,"" Dolcos explained. ""However, further research is needed to determine which form of self-advice, written or spoken, is more beneficial."" 
 Question:What did the researchers find? 
A. Giving oneself advice and encouragement is very useful. 
B. It is more encouraging to talk to oneself using the second-person. 
C. First-person self-talk will not improve your performance. 
D. A good way to motivate yourself is saying ""I can do it"".

Context: It was a long process that involved creating a resume, submitting an online application  and attending a round of interviews. Naturally Tan Kaiyin, a 21-year-old student is excited when she was selected, as more than 660, 000 people signed up to volunteer at the 16thAsian Games in Guangzhou, but only less than 10 percent were finally chosen to work in the venues and wear the white and green sport uniforms.
Like in any major sporting event, volunteers play a vital role in assisting with operations and Tan's function here is not any different. She is based at the Garden Hotel and is tasked with helping guests and officials who have issues with their accreditation cards . ""I deal with guests from all over the world, I have never met so many international people and it is very, very exciting to have this opportunity to interact with them. They come to the office because they need to make a change in their accreditation card and usually they are in a hurry, so we try our best to get it done quickly."" 
She admits the first few days involved extremely long hours, however she likes the challenge as it gives her an immense sense of satisfaction especially when an irate guest turns a frown into a smile and says ""thank you"". 
Tan deals with people from different cultures and personalities and feels she has learned so much in the past week, an experience that she would have never gotten if not for the Guangzhou Asian Games, therefore she is very happy and grateful for being a part of this. She also has kind words for her managers and fellow colleagues and says the hard work and positive atmosphere has bonded them into a family. She enjoys her responsibilities so much that she is afraid of feeling lost when the Games finally end on Nov. 27. 
However, she is aware of all the positive effects the Games have had on Guangzhou. From improvements to air and water quality to better transportation and infrastructure in the city, but most importantly to her is the fact that the Asian Games has placed Guangzhou prominently onto the world map. This, she believes, will encourage people from all over the world to continue visiting her city, and this in turn will give the residents of Guangzhou a fantastic opportunity to continue learning about different cultures. The official Asian Games Volunteer Slogan is, ""Together, we can make it better!"" Indeed it seems they can. 
 Question:In Tan's opinion, what is NOT the positive effects the Games have had on Guangzhou 
A. Improvements of air and water quality and better transportation 
B. Asian Games has place Guangzhou prominently onto the world map. 
C. The Game will give the residents of Guangzhou a fantastic opportunity to continue learning about different cultures. 
D. It disturbs people's normal life who are living in Guangzhou.

Context: I have a friend named Monty Roberts who owns a horse ranch . He has let me use his house to put on fund-raising events. The last time I was there he introduced me by saying: ""I want to tell you a story. It all goes back to a story about a young man who was the son of an itinerant horse trainer who would go from stable to stable, race track to race track, farm to farm and ranch to ranch, training horses. As a result, the boy's high school career was continually interrupted. When he was a senior, he was asked to write a paper about what he wanted to be and do when he grew up.
""That night he wrote a seven-page paper describing his goal of someday owning a horse ranch. He wrote about his dream in great detail and he even drew a diagram of a 200-acre ranch, showing the location of all the buildings, the stables and the track. Then he drew a detailed floor plan for a 4,000-square-foot house that would sit on a 200-acre dream ranch.
""He put a great deal of his heart into the project and the next day he handed it in to his teacher. Two days later he received his paper back. On the front page was a large red F with a note that read, 'See me after class.'
""The boy with the dream went to see the teacher after class and asked, 'Why did I receive an F?' The teacher said, 'This is an unrealistic dream for a young boy like you. You have no money. You come from an itinerant family. You have no resources. Owning a horse ranch requires a lot of money. You have to buy the land. You have to pay for the original breeding stock and later you'll have to pay large stud fees. There's no way you could ever do it.' Then the teacher added, 'If you will rewrite this paper with a more realistic goal, I will reconsider your grade.'
""The boy went home and thought about it long and hard. He asked his father what he should do. His father said, 'Look, son, you have to make up your own mind on this. However, I think it is a very important decision for you.' Finally, after a week, the boy turned in the same paper, making no changes at all. He stated, 'You can keep the F and I'll keep my dream.' ""
Monty then turned to the group present and said, ""I tell you this story because you are sitting in my 4,000-square-foot house in the middle of my 200-acre horse ranch. I still have that school paper framed over the fireplace."" He added, ""The best part of the story is that two years ago that same schoolteacher brought 30 kids to camp out on my ranch for a week. When the teacher was leaving, he said, 'Look, Monty, I can tell you this now. When I was your teacher, I was something of a dream stealer. During those years I stole a lot of kids' dreams. Fortunately you had enough courage not to give up yours.' ""
""Don't let anyone steal your dreams. Follow your heart, no matter what,"" Monty at last concluded. 
 Question:Which of the following could best express the teacher's feelings when she said the words before leaving the ranch two years ago? 
A. Regretful and proud. 
B. Regretful and guilty. 
C. Honest and sorry. 
D. Embarrassed and proud.

Then one evening in June last year, she received a text message telling her she was out of work. ""The first two weeks were the most difficult to live through,"" she said. ""After everything I'd done for the company, they dismiss me by text! I was so angry and I just didn't feel like looking for another job. I hated everything about the city and my life.""
Then, Zoe received an invitation from an old school friend, Kathy, to come and stay. Kathy and her husband, Huw, had just bought a farm in north west Wales. Zoe jumped at the chance to spend a weekend away from London, and now, then months later, she is still on the farm.

Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""
It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on. 
 Question:That man called after reading about what Jordan did to a disabled child because he wanted to   _  . 
A. become famous himself 
B. know why Jordan appeared in a poor area 
C. let the author know that Jordan was not that nice 
D. offer another example to show that Jordan was a nice man

Context: It was unusually quiet in the emergency room on December 25.
I was nurse on duty that day. I didn't think there would be any patients, sighing about having to work on Christmas. Just then five bodies showed up at my desk, a pale woman and four small children.
""Are you all sick?"" I asked suspiciously.
""Yes,"" she said weakly and lowered her head.
But when it came to descriptions of their presenting problems, things got a little vague. Two of the children had headaches, but the headaches weren't accompanied by the normal body language of holding the head or trying to keep it still. Two children had earaches, but only one could tell me which ear was affected. The mother complained of a cough but seemed to work to produce it.
Something was wrong, but I didn't say anything but explained that it might be a little while before a doctor saw her. She responded, ""Take your time; it's warm here.""
On a hunch  , I checked the chart after the admitting clerk had finished registering the family. No address---they were homeless. The waiting room was warm.
I looked out at the family huddled by the Christmas tree. The little one was pointing at the television and exclaiming something to her mother. The oldest one was looking at an ornament on the Christmas tree.
I went back to the nurses' station and mentioned we had a homeless family in the waiting room. The nurses, grumbling about working Christmas, turned to compassion for a family just trying to get warm on Christmas. The team went into action, much as we do when there's a medical emergency. But this one was a Christmas emergency.
We were all offered a free meal in the hospital cafeteria on Christmas Day, so we claimed that meal and prepared a banquet for our Christmas guests. We needed presents. We put together oranges and apples in a basket. We collected from different departments candies, crayons and other things available that could be presents. As seriously as we met the physical needs of the patients that came to us that day, our team worked to meet the needs, and exceed the expectations, of a family who just wanted to be warm on Christmas Day.
Later, as the family walked to the door to leave, the four year old came running back, gave me a hug and whispered, ""Thanks for being our angels today."" 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? 
A. Something was wrong with one of the children's heads. 
B. The pale woman forgot to write the address. 
C. The author did not understand the truth. 
D. The children's mother told a lie. 
 Answer: D
Context: We discuss the issue of when to help a patient die. Doctors of our generation are not newcomers to this question. Going back to my internship days, I can remember many patients in pain, sometimes in coma , with late, hopeless cancer. For many of them, we wrote an order for heavy medication--morphine by the clock. This was not talked about openly and little was written about it. It was essential, not controversial.
The best way to bring the problem into focus is to describe two patients whom I cared for. The first, formerly a nurse, had an automobile accident. A few days later her lungs seemed to fill up; her heart developed dangerous rhythm disturbances. So there she was: in coma, on a breathing machine, her heartbeat maintained with an electrical device. One day after rounds, my secretary said the husband and son of the patient wanted to see me. They told me their wife and mother was obviously going to die; she was a nurse and had told her family that she never wanted this kind of terrible death, being maintained by machines. I told them that while I respected their view, there was nothing deadly about her situation. The kidney  failure she had was just the kind for which the artificial kidney was most effective. While possibly a bit reassured, they were disappointed. Here was the head surgeon seemingly determined to keep everybody alive, no matter what.
Within a few days the patient's pacemaker  could be removed and she awoke from her coma. About six months later, the door of my office opened and in walked a gloriously fit woman. After some cheery words of appreciation, the father and son asked to speak to me alone. As soon as the door closed, both men became quite tearful. All that came out was, ""We want you to know how wrong we were.""
The second patient was an 85-year-old lady whose hair caught fire while she was smoking. She arrived with a deep burn; I knew it would surely be deadly. As a remarkable coincidence there was a meeting for discussion going on at the time in medical ethics . The speaker asked me if I had any sort of ethical problem I could bring up for discussion. I described the case and asked the students their opinion. After the discussion, I made a remark that was, when looking back, a serious mistake. I said, ""I'll take the word back to the nurses about her and we will talk about it some more before we decide."" The instructor and the students were shocked: ""You mean this is a real patient?"" The teacher of ethics was not accustomed to being challenged by actuality. In any event, I went back and met with the nurses. A day or two later, when she was making no progress and was suffering terribly, we began to back off treatment. Soon she died quietly and not in pain. As a reasonable physician, you had better move ahead and do what you would want done for you. And don't discuss it with the world first. There is a lesson here for everybody. Assisting people to leave this life requires strong judgment and long experience to avoid its misuse. 
 Question:The author suggested that doctors  _   before they assist a patient in killing himself. 
A. do what they are wanted to do 
B. discuss with the others about the decision first 
C. be required to do so first by the patient 
D. make sure there is no other choice left 
 Answer: D
Context: Last year Jim was going to join the army( ) and had to take a medical examination  . The doctor was sitting at a desk when he went in. He said to the man, ""Take your coat and shirt off, and sit on that chair.""
Jim did so. The doctor looked at him for a moment without getting up from his chair and then said, ""All right. Put your clothes on again.""
""But you haven't examined me at all."" the young man said in surprise.
""There is no need to do so,"" the doctor said with a smile. ""When I told you to take your coat and shirt off, you heard me all right, so there is nothing wrong with your ears. You saw your chair, so your eyes are good. You could take your clothes off and sit on the chair, so you must be in good health. 
 Question:Why did the young man take a medical examination? 
A. He hurt his ear. 
B. He hoped to join the army. 
C. He wanted to get some medicine.

 Answer: B
Context: When a first-time father saw his newborn son, he immediately noticed the baby's ears obviously standing out from his head. He expressed his concern to the nurse that some children might be made fun of his child. A doctor examined the baby and reassured the new dad that his son was healthy---- the ears presented only a small problem with its appearance.
But the nervous father continued. He wondered if the child might suffer psychological effects of ridicule, or if they should consider plastic surgery . The nurse assured him that it was really no problem, and he should just wait to see if the boy grows into his ears.
The father finally felt more optimistic about his child, but now he worried about his wife's reaction to those large ears. She had been delivered by operation, and had not yet seen the child.
""She doesn't take things as easily as I do,"" he said to the nurse.
By this time, the new mother was settled in the recovery room and ready to meet her new baby. The nurse went along with the dad to lend some support in case this inexperienced mother became upset about her baby's large ears.
The baby was in a blanket  with his head covered for the short trip through the cold air-conditioned corridor. The baby was placed in his mother's arms, who eased the blanket back so that she could look at her child for the first time.
She took one look at her baby's face and looked to her husband and gasped, ""Oh, Honey! Look! He has your ears!""
No problem with Mom. She married those ears...and she loves the man to whom _ are attached.
The poet Kahlil Gibran said, ""Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart."" It's hard to see the ears when you're looking into the light. 
 Question:What is true about the baby's mother? 
A. She blamed her husband for the baby's big ears. 
B. She was the first to discover the baby's large ears. 
C. She suggested having an operation on the baby immediately. 
D. She found something similar between the baby and its father.

Context: It was something she had dreamed of since she was five. Finally, after years of training and intensive workouts, Deborah Duffey was going to compete in her first high school basketball game. The goals of becoming an outstanding player and playing college ball were never far from Deborah's mind.
The game was against Mills High School. With 1 minute and 42 seconds left in the game, Deborah's team led by one point. A player of Mills had possession of the ball,and Deborah ran to guard against her. As Deborah was running to block the player, her knee went out and she fell down on the court in burning pain. Just like that, Deborah's season was over.
After suffering the bad injury, Deborah found that, for the first time in her life, she was in a situation beyond her control. Game after game, she could do nothing but sit on the sidelines watching others play the game that she loved so much.
Injuries limited Deborah's time on the court as she hurt her knees three more times in the next five years. She had to spend countless hours in a physical clinic to receive treatment. Her frequent visits there gave her a passion and respect for the profession.  And Deborah began to see a new light in her life.
Currently as a senior in college, Deborah focuses on getting a degree in physical treatment. After she graduates, Deborah plans to use her knowledge to educate people how to best take care of their bodies and cope with the feelings of hopelessness that she remembers so well. 
 Question:How did Deborah feel when she first hurt her knee?

B. Confused.

Context: Contrary to popular belief, looking at someone's face alone is not enough to tell us whether they are roaring in celebration or screaming in frustration, researchers claimed.While people may believe they have the ability to read each other's faces, body language is the real clue that shows whether strong emotions someone is feeling are positive or negative.
In a study, groups of participants were shown a series of facial expressions such as tennis players photographed just after winning or losing a point.
In some cases the volunteers were able to see the player's full body, but in others they were only shown either their face or their body with the other removed.
Participants could clearly tell whether the players were winning or losing when they were shown the full picture or just the body, but their guesses were no better than chance when based on the face alone.
Those who were allowed to see the full image were convinced they had made their judgment based on the players' facial expressions even though results from the two other groups suggested otherwise.
The researchers carried out a second study where participants were shown a wider range of faces showing emotions including joy, pleasure, victory, pain and defeat.
Using photoediting software, the researchers attached the faces to bodies expressing the opposite emotion, and asked participants to act out the emotions they saw in the photos.
The resulting poses were like the body poses in the photographs but not the facial expressions, demonstrating that people base their interpretation of strong emotions not on the face but the body.
Dr Aviezer, who led the study, said, ""These results show that when emotions become extremely intense, the difference between positive and negative facial expressions becomes unclear.The results may help researchers understand how our body interacts during emotional situations.For example, individuals may fail to recognize facial expressions, but if they are trained to process important body language, their performance may significantly improve."" 
 Question:What did Dr Aviezer think of the results of the study? 
A. Ridiculous. 
B. Useless. 
C. Unrealistic. 
D. Helpful. 
 Answer: D
Context: Life is filled with challenges. As we get older, we come to realize that those challenges are the very things that shape us and make us who we are. It is the same with the challenges that come with friendship. When we are faced with a challenge, we usually have two choices. We can try to beat it off, or we can decide that the thing presenting the challenge isn't worth the trouble and call it quits. Although there are certainly times when calling it quits is the right thing to do, in most cases all that is needed is commitment and communication.
When we are committed to something, it means that no matter how painful or how uncomfortable something is, we will always choose to face it through instead of running away from it. Communication is making a space for discussion and talking about how you feel as opposed to just saying what the other person did wrong. If you can say to a friend, ""I got my feelings hurt"", rather than ""You hurt my feelings"", you are going to be able to solve the problem much faster.
In dealing with many challenges that friendship will bring to you, try to see them for what they are: small hurdles you need to jump or get through on your way through life. Nothing is so big that it is impossible to get over, and hurt only serves to make us stronger. It is all part of growing up, it happens to everyone, and some day you will look back on all of this and say, ""Hard as it was, it made me who I am today. And that is a good thing."" 
 Question:If your friend hurts your feelings, you are advised to   _  . 
A. point out your friend's mistake 
B. calm yourself down 
C. start a proper conversation

Context: Hunters and bears are often put in fairy tales and often provide a lot for us to think about life and human nature.
Two hunters, Ali and Hagan, went hunting for bears. For four days they saw nothing. Each night they slept in a nearby village, pledging  to make part of the bear's skin against the cost of their lodging  . On the fifth day a huge bear appeared, and Ali said nervously to his friend, ""I don't mind admitting that I'm afraid to take this bear."" Hagan laughed, ""Just leave it to me, little coward.""
So Ali  _ like lightning up the nearest tree at once, and Hagan stood with his gun at the ready. The huge creature came, moving on in a slow and awkward way, and Hagan began to grow more and more scared. At last he raised his gun to his shoulder, but by now he was trembling so much that, before he could take proper aim, his gun went off and missed the target .
Hagan, remembering that bears never touch a dead body, threw himself flat on the ground and held his breath. The bear came up, sniffed all around him and moved off in the end.
Ali, who had been watching the whole thing from the tree, now came down and, congratulating Hagan on his escape, asked him, ""What did the bear whisper in your ear just now?""
""Don't sell the bear's skin before you have caught the bear,"" Hagan announced. 
 Question:What did Ali and Hagan do before they came across the huge bear?

Context: A 2-year-od boy is being described as a hero after using Face Time to save his mother after she was badly hurt.
According to a report from KGUN, Laura was trying to stop a fight between two dogs when one of the dogs bit  part of her middle finger almost completely off.
Laura tried to call 911 herself, but she said her hands were too badly hurt to make the call. "" I asked my daughters to call 911, and they're four, and they were quite afraid to even touch the phone, because it was covered in my blood ,"" Laura told KGUN.
The mother continued to lose a lot of blood and thought she would go into a deep sleep--until her 2-year-old son Bentley came up with a dishcloth from the kitchen. After cleaning some of the bold off his mother's iPhone, Bentley continued to use Face Time to call Laura's friend Connie.
""All I could see was his little forehead. I said 'Hi Bentley' and it was quiet for a little bit. Then I heard Laura shouting,"" Connie told KGUN.
Connie then called 911, and Bentley unlocked the door to let firefighters into the house.
Laura told KGUN she is very thankful for her little hero and has since taught all of her children how to call 911.

The man was obviously scared but tried to keep calm.He said,""I know what you are thinking,officer,but it isn't true.This is a funny mistake.""
""It's part of my job to take an interest in unusual events.I think you've just left this house in a manner other than the customary one.That may be quite innocent,but I'd like to make sure.""Tidwell took out his notebook and a pen.""Name,address and occupation and then,please,tell me your story...""

Context: The events of Saturday night in Kunming are deeply engraved in the mind of Xie Qiming, who narrowly escaped death in the terrorist attack at the city's railway station.
The 48-year-old policeman intervened to stop the butchering of unarmed civilians, saving many from death and injury, but he was injured in the process.
Lying in a hospital bed, his head and nose marked by serious hacking wounds - one more than 20 centimeters long - Xie recounted  his actions on the day he describes as a nightmare.
""I shot at them but fell to the ground during the fighting. After the shots, the terrorists turned their attention to the police and several of them surrounded me and stabbed me like crazy,"" he said. ""There is no humanity in them.""
Xie is from the Beijinglu Police Station, the closest to the attack, and four police officers from the station were the first to respond. He survived because he was wearing a bulletproof vest, which was damaged by the attackers.
When the officers arrived, the attackers were running out of the ticket hall, attacking people with long knives.
Xie and his colleagues tried to stop the attack, which is when Xie was injured. In addition to the deep cuts, his skull was fractured, and at the time of writing he was awaiting further surgery.
""A wave of fierce anger rose up in my mind, and we all forgot to think about the possible danger to us,"" said Hu Zhe, 23, a police officer trainee at the Beijinglu Police Station.
Having no firearm, he fought the terrorists with a wooden baton, but it got broken in the fighting. He sustained a 6-centimeter wound to his left eyebrow.
Wan Weiqing, a neurosurgeon from Beijing Tiantan Hospital, learned of the attack at 2 am on Sunday and took the first flight to Kunming, where he has been helping the victims.
He said that 71 victims are being treated at the Kunming First People's Hospital, most of them with severe multiple injuries.
""There is one victim whose rib, breastbone, lung and even heart were all injured in one chopping action. The attackers had obviously prepared and practiced for a long time,"" he said.
Zhou Hongmei, director of the Medical Reform Office at the Yunnan Health Department, said a team of medical experts including 29 doctors had arrived in Kunming by Monday night. They have been working at the five hospitals treating victims of the attack.
Chen Min, a Neurology Department nurse at Kunming First People's Hospital, said the department usually had seven nurses in the daytime and three at night. ""But all the other nurses who were not on duty returned to the hospital voluntarily on Saturday night,"" she said.
In the past three days, none of them had more than 10 hours of rest.
""The crucial factor in saving lives in such incidents is treatment without delay,"" said Chai Wenzhao, associate director of the Intensive Care Unit in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Chai has participated in many emergency rescue efforts.
He said that the victims will need psychological counseling once their physical injuries have been dealt with, because the emotional impact of such an incident can be severe.
Four psychologists from Anding Hospital in Beijing have begun treating some of the victims. 
 Question:How did Xie Qiming survive? 
A. He was saved by his colleagues. 
B. He missed the shot and fell to the ground during the fighting. 
C. He was protected by his bulletproof vest. 
D. He pretended to fall to the ground.

Context: Janice is an American engineer working in Nanjing. She and her husband George, who is teaching English at a university, have been eager to get to know Chinese people better, so they were pleased when Liu, Janice's young co-worker, invited them to her home for dinner.
When they arrived, Liu introduced them to her husband Yang and asked them to sit down at a table containing eight plates of various cold dishes. Half an hour later she came back and sat down and the three began to eat. Yang came in from time to time, putting hot dishes on the table. Most of the food was wonderful, though neither George nor Janice could eat the fatty pork, and there was much more than they could eat. They kept wishing Yang would sit down so they could talk to him. Finally he did sit down to eat a bit, but soon it was time to go home.
Janice and George felt slightly depressed by this experience, but returned the invitation two weeks later. They decided to make a nice American meal and felt lucky to find olives, crackers , tomato juice, and even some cheese in the shop. They put these out as appetizers . For the main course they prepared spaghetti and a salad.
When Liu and Yang arrived and began to have dinner, they took small tastes of the appetizers and seemed surprised when both George and Janice sat down with them. They ate only a little spaghetti and didn't finish the salad on their plates. After a while, George cleared the table and served coffee and pastries . Yang and Liu each put four spoons of sugar into their coffee but didn't drink much of it and ate only a bite or two of pastry.
After they left, George and Janice were upset. "" We left their place so full but they're going to have to eat again when they get home. What went wrong?

Context: At East China University of Science and Technology, students who finish their food in the dining hall can get a coupon  when they return their tray . They can exchange coupons for small gifts, such as books, magazines, mobile phone covers and hand warmers.
""It's been a big surprise,"" said Liang Zhaoyun, 19, a student in the university of Shanghai. ""It makes us try our best to finish the food!""
But some food in the dining hall is so poorly prepared that students are _ to finish it all. Some schools have paid some attention to it.
""The dishes in our canteen are all right, generally speaking. We've tried our best to make it tasty. But of course it's difficult to make all the students love it."" said Wang.
Other universities also pay attention to the size of food. At Nanjing University, rice is divided into three different-sized bowls that students can choose from.
""I like to try different dishes at each meal. So I had to throw away a lot of food because the bowls were too big. But now the dining hall offers small sizes. It's great because I can try different dishes at half price and don't waste so much food,"" said Fan Peng, a student from Nanjing University.
But what if you really can't finish all your food? Some universities also provide a take-away service. If you can't finish all your food, you can get a box to take the leftovers home. Even if you feed the cat, it's not wasted.
So you see, if we call on students not to waste food, schools should also improve the service and meal quality. 
 Question:In order to reduce the waste, universities do a lot of things except   _  . 
A. trying to make the food as delicious as possible. 
B. offering different sizes of the food. 
C. exchanging trays for coupons and gifts. 
D. raising the price of the food.

Context: Recently, we were given the opportunity to review a book written by a young author. When we received it, I noted how beautifully done it was. While often the case---we see beautifully written and illustrated books all the time---but how often do they come from a 10-year-old? Sewing a Friendship, written by a creative and talented young girl named Natalie Tinti, is such a book.
Developing friendships is an area that Natalie Tinti has researched in her own life. In her book, Sewing a Friendship, she tells what great things can happen if kids take a step toward friendship.
Tinti's characters in Sewing a Friendship have colorful and creative personalities. Jonsy Jipsy loves singing and belly dance. Sokron Blossom lives in a neat and tidy world and loves to read fashion magazines. Meeka likes brain games and Nina is happy with her life and the music it brings her.
All but one of the characters seems happy with their lives. One of the girls, Kiki Shaver, was sad to live in a small home with her aunt and uncle. She had no friend and didn't know how to make them. When four girls invites her into the circle of their friendship, it's no wonder that Kiki is hesitant and uneasy.
The story continues as the four girls invite and accept a "" not so likeable"" girl into their circle to win a fashion show. The girls feel a strong bond of friendship after the show. Kiki then understands that taking a step towards friendship is better than being alone. All the girls learn that by having the courage to include others, you can "" sew a friendship"".
Today, it seems that almost every news headline begins with a child's suicide---or murder---because of being bullied ,not having friends or family to discuss issues with and feelings of low self -respect. What's causing these senseless terrible events? If more kids would invite the outcasts  into their circle of friends, lives would be saved as well as pointed in another direction.
Natalie Tinti finds her voice in Sewing a Friendship ---and shows a talent that's rare for such a young girl. Recommended reading for all young adult fans. 
 Question:The author seems to agree that   _  . 
A. bullying is the main cause of children's suicides 
B. we should not expect too much from friendship 
C. friendship has the power to prevent sad events 
D. one should not forget his old circle of friends

Context: Cheating can happen in a lot of different ways. When people cheat, it's not fair to other people, like the kids who studiedfor the test or who were the true winners of a game.
Many people like the action of cheating. It makes difficult things seem easy, like getting all the right answers on the test. But it doesn't solve the problem of not knowing the material and it won't help on the next test --- unless the person cheats again.
Some people lose respect for cheaters and think less of them. The cheaters themselves may feel bad because they know they are not really earning that good grade. And, if they get caught cheating, they will be in trouble at school, and maybe at home, too.
Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating. Even when there seems to be a ""good reason"" for cheating, cheating isn't a good idea.
If you were sick or upset about something the night before and couldn't study, it would be better to talk with the teacher about this. And if you don't have enough time to study for a test because of swim practice, you need to talk with your parents about how to balance swimming and school.
A kid who thinks cheating is the only way to pass a test needs to talk with the teacher and his or her parents so they can find some solutions  together. Talking about these problems and working them out will be better than cheating. 
 Question:In the passage those cheaters are advised to  _  . 
A. spend more time on school than on sports 
B. try hard to be intelligent rather than lazy 
C. find good solutions instead of cheating 
D. ask their classmates for good methods of study

Context: Linda was kind of late. Linda, 25, had a lot to do at work, plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Linda felt weak and tired -- maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks.
Several yards away, Frank, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying.
But when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, ""Oh, my God, she fell in!""Frank didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. ""No ! Not you ! ""his girlfriend screamed after him.
She was right to be alarmed. By the time Frank reached Linda, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station.
It was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the arms and drag her away from the edge. That was where Linda briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse.
Linda thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in.
Police and fire officials soon arrived, and Frank told the story to an officer. Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40minute train ride downtown--just as he had been seconds after the rescue, which made her think about her reaction at the time. ""I saw the train coming and I was thinking he was going to die, "" she explained. 
 Question:How did Frank save Linda? 
A. By helping her rise to her feet. 
B. By lifting her to the platform. 
C. By pulling her along the ground. 
D. By dragging her away from the edge.

Context: There was once a forest made up of tiny trees that were all growing up together. They had been planted by a very old gardener who took care that they would all grow up to be straight and healthy. However, the area was hit by strong winds, and the little trees preferred to avoid the annoying winds, so they bent  their trunks   and branches to protect themselves.
The old man, knowing they could never grow well like this, decided to straighten them out, and spent many hours tying their tiny trunks to supporting poles , hoping his beloved trees would understand he was doing this for their own good. But those naughty trees disliked all the wind. They always avoided the gardener's help by bending themselves, hiding from the wind. One of those trees, one standing right in the middle of the forest, forced itself to grow up straight, patiently bearing the annoying wind.
Three years passed, and the old man died. And from then on the trees could grow however they liked, bending from the wind just as they pleased, with no one bothering them about it. All, that was, except the single straight tree in the center of the forest, who decided to grow up just as a tree should.
But as the forest grew, and the trees got thicker and stronger, they began to hear cracks  from inside. Their branches and trunks needed to keep growing, but the trees were so twisted that the growth they were experiencing only brought them pain and suffering.
And it was a place with a special beauty since, right in its center, surrounded by thousands of short twisted trees, rose one impressive tree that was long and straight like no others. And that tree, the only one that never cracked, continued growing, without a worry for the changeable wind. 
 Question:How long did the old gardener look after the trees? 
A. Two years. 
B. Three years. 
C. Four years. 
D. Five years. 
 Answer: B
Context: Modern man has cleared the forests for farmland and for wood, and has also carelessly burned them. More than that, though, he has also interfered   with the invisible bonds between the living things in the forests. There are many examples of this kind of destruction. The harmfulness of man's interference can be seen in what happened many years ago in the forest of the Kaibab plateau   of northern Arizona. Man tried to improve on the natural web of forest life and destroyed it instead.
The Kaibab had a storybook forest of large sized pine, Douglas fir, white fir, blue and _ . In 1882 a visitor noted, ""We, who ... have wandered through its forests and parks, have come to regard it as the most enchanting region it has ever been our privilege   to visit."" This was also the living place of the Rocky Mountain mule deer. Indians hunted there every autumn to gather meat and skins. The forest also had mountain lions, timber wolves and bobcats that kept the deer from multiplying too rapidly.
Then, in 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt made the Kaibab a national game preserve. Deer hunting was forbidden. Government hunters started killing off the deer's enemies. In 25 years' time, 6,250 mountain lions, wolves and bobcats were killed. Before the program, there were about 4,000 deer in the Kaibab, by 1924, there were about 100,000.
The deer ate every leaf and twig they could reach. But there was not nearly enough food. Hunting of deer was permitted again. This caused a slight decrease in the deer herd  ,but a far greater loss resulted from starvation   and disease. Some 60 percent of the deer herd died in two winters. By 1930 the herd had dropped to 20,000 animals. By 1942 it was down to 8,000. 
 Question:The destruction of the environment of the Kaibab resulted from  _ 
A. interfering with natural cycle of forest life 
B. turning the forest into cultivated land 
C. forest fires caused by man's carelessness 
D. cutting the trees for building materials 
 Answer: A

Context: Move over Psy. There's a new viral music video on the Internet that's getting millions of people dancing and laughing. Psy is a singer who created Gagnam Style, a music video which featured a catchy tune and interesting dance.
The new music video called The Fox (What does the fox say?) has recently gone viral. At     123 000 000 views, it may even catch up to Gagnam Style. The video asks the question, ""What does the fox say?"" It's a good question. And it seems, at least according to the music video, there is no good answer.
Actors in the video dress up like the animals they're singing about. One of the brothers dresses up like a fox. There is a surprising and silly dance in the video that takes the viewer a bit _ . The video's appeal is the song's simple rhythm and catchy chorus  .
The makers of the video never expected the video to do well or even to be taken seriously. In fact, it started out as a joke. The song was written by two brothers from Norway, Vegard and Bard Ylvis ker. The brothers have their own late-night talk show in Norway. They thought the video would be so bad that it would give them something to talk about on their show.
On their website, they say the video was ""supposed to entertain a few Norwegians for three minutes -- and that's all."" But people started loving it. Some people say that once you listen to the delightfully silly song, you want to listen to it again and again.
The brothers have been guests on some major North American talk shows. They say they're happy about the success of their video, but they know that tomorrow something else could come along and be even bigger. 
 Question:Which of the following best describes the new music video The Fox? 
A. It can catch the viewers' heart easily by its amusing tune and dance. 
B. It features the same story with the music video Gagnam Style. 
C. It answers the question ""What does the fox say?"" exactly. 
D. It has the real animals in the video.

Context: Rahfeal Gordon has come a long way from the homeless shelters and streets of Newark, New Jersey. The 25-year-old was honored this year by the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship for his work----giving motivational speeches to youth groups.

Context: NEW YORK-- The band Atomic Tom has scored an Internet hit with its self-created video to the song Take Me Out. In the video, the band members ride a New York City subway while performing entirely on iPhones, with applications linked with mini-battery powered broadcasters for each instrument.
Singer Luck White says the production was a top-secret operation.
""We didn't tell anyone about this. It was completely top-secret from our family, from our friends, from management, from everybody. So the first time that people saw this video was last Friday when we put it on YouTube,""explained White.
It has been watched by more than 2 million on YouTube since debuting  last week. ""All I've wanted to do for the past few days is just stare at the YouTube page and keep refreshing it to see how far it will go, "" said Espiritu, the lead guitarist of the band.
""The Internet changed everything,""Espiritu said. ""It's kind of an exciting time because it forces everyone to adjust and be creative and find new ways to get your name out there.""

"" I've seen a lot of these music applications, and they're kind of fascinating to me,""Benjamin Espiritu said. "" I thought: 'What would happen if iPhones kind of took over the world? If there could actually be a band that played straight through with iPhones, what would that look like?'"" So they shot  the video --with iPhones also serving as video cameras. The band also tried Union Square but were stopped during playing because they didn't have a permit.
"" _ ,""Espiritu said. ""We've seen the jump."" Their album has been in the top 10albums on iTunes.
Will their fans start cheering for iPhone-only performances? ""We've gotten the most exposure and teh most fans that we've ever gotten through this, so I wouldn't be surprised if fans are going to want to see that.: Espritu said.

Context: One day,Mr.Arnold was teaching a lesson,and things were going as normally as ever.He was explaining the story of mankind to his pupils.He told them that,in the beginning,men were nomads ;they never stayed in the same place for very long.Instead,they would travel about,here and there,in search of food,wherever it was to be found. And when the food ran out,they would move off somewhere else.
He taught them about the invention of farming and keeping animals.This was an important discovery,because by learning to cultivate the land,and care for animals,mankind would always have food steadily available.It also meant that people could remain living in one place,and this made it easier to set about tasks that would take a long while to complete,like building towns,cities,and all that were in them.All the children listening were attracted by this story,until Lucy jumped up:
""And if that was so important and improved everything so much,why are we nomads all over again,Mr.Arnold?""
Mr.Arnold didn't know what to say. Lucy was a very intelligent girl.He knew that she lived with her parents in a house,so she must know that her family were not nomads;so what did she mean?
""We have all become nomads again,"" continued Lucy.""The other day,outside the city,they were cutting the forest down. A while ago a fisherman told me how they fish.It's the same with everyone:when there's no more forest left, the foresters go elsewhere,and when the fish run out, the fishermen move on.That's what the nomads did,isn't it?""
The teacher nodded,thoughtfully. Really,Lucy was right. Mankind had turned into nomads. Instead of looking after the land in a way that we could be sure it would keep supplying our needs,we kept developing it until the land was bare.And then off we would go to the next place!            The class spent the rest of the afternoon talking about what they could do to show how to be more civilized.
The next day everyone attended class wearing a green Tshirt,with a message that said,""I am not a nomad!""
And,from then on,they set about showing that indeed they were not.Every time they knew they needed something,they made sure that they would get it using care and control.If they needed wood or paper,they would make sure that they got the recycled kind.They ordered their fish from fish farms,making sure that the fish they received were not too young and too small.They only used animals that were well cared for,and brought up on farms.
And so,from their little town,those children managed to give up being nomads again,just as prehistoric men had done so many thousands of years ago. 
 Question:The writer tries to make us believe that  _  .

Context: One day, Mr. Arnold was teaching a lesson, and things were going as normally as ever. He was explaining the story of mankind to his pupils. He told them that, in the beginning, men were nomads; they never stayed in the same place for very long. Instead, they would travel about, here and there, in search of food, wherever it was to be found. And when the food ran out, they would move off somewhere else.
He taught them about the invention of farming and keeping animals. This was an important discovery, because by learning to cultivate the land, and care for animals, mankind would always have food steadily available. It also meant that people could remain living in one place, and this made it easier to set about tasks that would take a long while to complete, like building towns, cities, and all that were in them. All the children were listening attracted by this story, until Lucy jumped up:
""And if that was so important and improved everything so much, why are we nomads all over again, Mr. Arnold?""
Mr. Arnold didn't know what to say. Lucy was a very intelligent girl. He knew that she lived with her parents in a house, so she must know that her family were not nomads; so what did she mean?
""We have all become nomads again,"" continued Lucy, ""The other day, outside the city, they were cutting the forest down. A while ago a fisherman told me how they fish. It's the same with everyone: when there's no more forest left the foresters go elsewhere, and when the fish run out the fishermen move on. That's what the nomads did, isn't it ?
The teacher nodded, thoughtfully. Really, Lucy was right Mankind had turned into nomads. Instead of looking after the land in a way that we could be sure it would keep supplying our needs, we kept developing it until the land was bare. And then off we would go to the next place! The class spent the rest of the afternoon talking about what they could do to show how to be more civilized.
The next day everyone attended class wearing a green T-shirt, with a message that said "" _ ""
And , from then on, they set about showing that indeed they were not. Every time they knew they needed something, they made sure that they would get it using care and control. If they needed wood or paper, they would make sure that they got the recycled kind. They ordered their fish from fish farms, making sure that the fish they received were not too young and too small. They only used animals that were well cared for, and brought up on farms.
And so, from their little town, those children managed to give up being nomads again, just as prehistoric men had done, so many thousands of years ago. 
 Question:In the teacher's opinion, Lucy's argument was  _ 
A. shocking 
B. ridiculous 
C. puzzling 
D. reasonable

Context: Recently I fully understood that a little favor could really make a big difference. My daughter and I were, accidentally, in time to catch a falling heart just before it hit the ground.
It all started when Charlene, one of my co-volunteers at the library, asked if I could do her duty on Tuesday since her doctor appointment had been unexpectedly changed. I agreed, which meant I  was home on Friday instead of volunteering as previously planned.
My daughter, Mary, managers a book store in town. Mid-morning, she called to ask me for help. Would I buy a fifty dollar gift card, birthday card, and cake for one of Mary's assistant managers, Cindy?
Mary explained she had to call Cindy in to take the place of another assistant manager who was sick, but felt terrible about it when she discovered it was Cindy's birthday. Cindy insisted that it was just fine. But that was not what Mary thought, so she gathered enough money from other employees to throw a surprise party for Cindy. Since neither Mary, nor any of the other employees, could leave to pick up the _ , they were turning to me for help. Days later, Mary told me the wonderful rest of the story, ""Cindy cried and cried when we surprised her. After the party, Cindy told us that her boyfriend had chosen that morning to break up with her. To top that off, she only had 26 cents left in her bank account.""
We were surprised at the series of unexpected events that took place in order to circle Cindy with love and catch her falling heart just before it hit the ground.

Context: I was waiting in a check-in line at Arlanda International Airport. The man ahead of me was quite a big guy. As an airport baggage handler checked through a customer at the roadside, he accidentally knocked over the man's luggage. He quickly collected the fallen bags and apologized for his mistake.

Context: An Outstanding Teacher  
Ben put the white envelope into the mailbox. He felt proud, excited, and happy--and also a little nervous about whether his essay would win.
Ben's local newspaper had advertised a contest inviting students to submit essays in honor of a remarkable teacher. The newspaper would choose the five best essays and print them in the paper. As soon as Ben heard about the contest, he knew he wanted to write about Mrs. Gruen.
Mrs. Gruen was always so friendly and patient, and she always had something encouraging to say to her students. Even more importantly, she knew how to make science interesting and enjoyable. Before being in her class, Ben would have said he was uninterested in science, but now science was his favorite subject.
At first, Ben had struggled with his essay. After he finished his first draft, he asked his older sister, Hannah, to review it. Eventually, after many more revisions, the essay was ready to mail. As Ben stood before the mailbox, he imagined how surprised Mrs. Gruen would be  to open the newspaper and see her name in print. 
When the big day finally came, Ben opened the newspaper and eagerly studied the columns of print for the essay he had written. He did not see his essay anywhere. He turned through all of the pages, but it was not there! Instead, he saw five other essays talking about five other teachers. Ben felt like a balloon that had suddenly lost all its air.
A few days later in science class, Mrs. Gruen asked Ben to stay after class for a few minutes. ""Your sister stopped by yesterday,"" Mrs. Gruen told Ben. ""She brought me the most wonderful gift."" Ben saw that Mrs. Gruen was holding a copy of his essay. ""You have no idea how much it means to me that you enjoy my class and think I'm a good teacher. No reward or honor could ever be greater than this essay,"" said Mrs. Gruen.
""OK,"" Ben said, ""I meant everything I wrote."" Then he stepped into the hallway with his head held high. 
 Question:What did Mrs. Gruen think of Ben's essay? 
A. It built up her reputation. 
B. It was a great honor to her. 
C. It helped Ben make progress. 
D. It deserved to win an award.

Context: Many jobs must be done with two people. One person takes the lead. The other helps. So it is with the human body. Much of our body depends on the cooperation between substances. When they work together, chemical reactions take place smoothly. Body systems are kept in balance.
Some of the most important helpers in the job of good health are the substances we call vitamins. The word ""vitamin"" dates back to Polish scientist Casimir Funk in 1912. He was studying a substance in rice. Funk believed the substance belonged to a group of chemicals known as amines  . He added the Latin word ""vita"", meaning life. So he called the substance a ""vitamine""--an amine necessary for life.
Other studies found that not all vitamins were amines. So the name was shortened to vitamin. But Funk was correct in recognizing their importance.
Scientists have discovered 14 kinds of vitamins. They say vitamins help to carry out chemicals changes within cells. If we do not get enough of the vitamins, we are at risk of developing a number of diseases. _ brings us back to James Lind of Scotland. In the 1740s, Lind was a doctor for the British Navy. He was investigating a problem that had existed in the Navy for many years.
The problem was the disease scurvy . The sailors were weak from bleeding inside their bodies. Even the smallest wound would not heal. Doctor Lind thought the sailors were getting sick because they failed to eat some kinds of foods when they were at sea for many months.
Doctor Lind separated twelve sailors who had scurvy into two groups. He gave each group different foods to eat. One group got oranges and lemons. The other did not. The men who ate the fruit began to improve within seven days. The other men got weaker.
However, which foods should be eaten to keep us healthy? Let us look at some important vitamins for these answers. 
 Question:Why was the name ""vitamine"" shortened to ""vitamin""? 
A. Because Funk was totally wrong. 
B. Because few vitamins were amines. 
C. Because there were new findings. 
D. Because the latter was easy to remember. 
 Answer: C
Context: The vitamins   are named by letters of the alphabet  . Vitamin A is needed by the eyes. There is Vitamin A in milk, butter, and green vegetables. It can be kept by the body.
Vitamin B cannot be kept. It must be supplied all the time by some of the food we eat.
Vitamin C is very important to the body. Without it men's teeth become loose   and their arms and legs get weak. Lemons  , oranges and tomatoes have Vitamin C in them.
Vitamin D is the sun vitamin. We get it in milk and eggs and from sunlight on our skin  . There are other Vitamins, but these A, B, C and D, are the most important. 
 Question:If somebody is near-eye sighted probably he needs   _  . 
A. Vitamin A 
B. Vitamins A and C 
C. Vitamin D 
D. Vitamin B 
 Answer: A
Context: Today, we know that the role of vitamins and minerals goes way beyond the prevention of deficiency diseases   to actually preventing cancer and heart disease, the most fearsome killers of our time. With this knowledge has come the widespread call for nutritional supplementation   -- and a confusing group of vitamin, mineral, and supplements lining the supermarket shelves.
Far from contributing to better health, however, nutritional supplements threaten to turn a scientific breakthrough into a nutritional disaster.
 _ of vitamins and minerals -- especially vitamins A, C, and E-- would have consumers believe that the little vitamin pill in the bottle is all they need for good health. Take your vitamins in the morning, and you're covered. It's okay to eat fast foods for the rest of the day or skip meals to achieve today's fashionably skinny look. But vitamins and minerals are only one part of the nutritional puzzle. A diet rich in fiber   and balanced in carbohydrates and protein is essential for good health. You can't get these things from a nutritional supplement. The focus on vitamin and mineral supplements may actually be robbing us of the full nutrition we seek.
And no supplement can compare to the quality of nutrition found in natural sources. For example, our bodies turn carotenes   from plant foods into vitamin A. Many supplements contain a single carotene, but natural sources are rich in many different carotenes. Many supplements contain a form of vitamin E that is made from chemicals, when natural vitamin E is more readily absorbed and used by the body. And science is still discovering the wealth of nutrients in foods.
You'd be hard-pressed to find a supplement as nutritionally comprehensive and powerful as a balanced diet. Even if you could, you'd pay much more than if you got the same nutritional value from natural sources.
But perhaps the greatest danger presented by nutritional supplements comes from the very real risks presented by self-medication. Anyone can walk into the market and buy as many different supplements as desired. The reported benefits of high dosages of certain nutrients have led some people to believe that the more the better. Many take several vitamin and mineral supplements without regard to possible consequences.
Surprising new research suggests that vitamin C pills may speed up hardening of the arteries, the underlying cause of heart attacks. Researchers said their findings support the recommendations of health organizations, which urge people to avoid high doses of supplements and to get their nutrients from food instead.
As appealing as they're made to sound, nutritional supplements are _ . If you're looking for good health, don't look on the supplement shelves of your supermarket. Look in the produce section instead. 
 Question:What has given rise to the great need for nutritional supplements? 
A. The knowledge of deficiency diseases. 
B. The low prices of nutritional supplements. 
C. The frighteningly high death rate from cancer and heart disease. 
D. The information about the role of vitamins and minerals in health. 
 Answer: D
Context: Sometimes successful health campaigns can have quite unexpected reactions. The years of warnings about skin cancer mean that Britons are happy to cover themselves in sunscreen or stay out of the sun altogether, but it also means that most of us are not getting enough vitamin D.
Scientists announced yesterday that Britons need to increase to three times the amount of vitamin D they get per day. They called on food producers to fortify their products with more of the vitamin and suggested people should consider taking supplements  to keep levels up. They also suggested getting out in the sun for short periods more often, but they warned against ""sun bingeing"".
The government does not publish official advice on the amount of vitamin D people should take due to a lack of research, says Dr Birgit Teucher of the Institute for Food Research. But in the US, the government recommends 5 micrograms a day. By that count, Dr Birgit Teucher said that around 90% of Britons between 19 and 64 would be lacking in the vitamin because they only took around 3 micrograms a day.
Vitamin D is important for absorption of calcium by the body, which is needed for healthy teeth and bones. A lack of it can lead to serious diseases in both children and adults. The vitamin can be found in some foods but it can also be obtained from chemicals in the skin reacting to sunlight. Dr Barbara Boucher said adults should get 5 to 25 micrograms a day. Shortage of vitamin D may be linked to diseases such as muscle weakness, high blood pressure and rickets .
Dr Birgit Teucher gave several reasons for the lack among Britons. Increasing numbers of office-based jobs mean a lack of exposure to the sun; and the rise of becoming overweight means that vitamin D--which is fat soluble is increasingly stored in body fat, where it cannot be accessed readily.
Professor Brian Wharton of the Institute of Child Health said that children in particular needed to have enough vitamin D to prevent rickets.
Professor Graham Bentham, an environmental scientist at the University of East Anglia, added that babies who were only breast-fed probably need to take supplements in case their mother was vitamin D lacking. Those drinking milk were likely to be OK, thanks to the fortification of the drink.
The scientists called on food producers to fortify milk, bread and breakfast nutrient to enable people to get their daily amount of the vitamin. Prof Graham Bentham added that 30 minutes of sun exposure to the face and forearms between April and October would be _ . Outside these months, the sun is not strong enough in Britain for the body to produce its own vitamin D.
But Prof Graham Bentham warned against spending too long in the sun. ""Sun bingeing is well known to be dangerous,"" he said. ""In any case, vitamin D transformation in the skin switches off after a while so short frequent amounts are better for vitamin D formation.""

Context: ""But what if I break my arm again?"" my 5-year-old daughter asked. I knew how much she wanted to learn to ride. Yet ever since she'd fallen off her bike and broken her arm, she'd been afraid.
""Oh honey,"" I said. ""I don't think you'll break another arm.""
""But I could, couldn't I?""
""Yes,"" I admitted, and found myself struggling for the right thing to say. ""I don't think I want to ride,"" she said and got off her bike.
We walked away and sat down beside a tree.
""Don't you want to ride with your friends?"" I asked. ""And I thought you were hoping to start riding your bike to school next year,"" I added.
""I was,"" she said in a low voice.
""You know, honey,"" I said. ""Most everything you do comes with dangers. You could break your arm at gymnastics. Do you want to stop going to the gym?"" ""No, of course not!"" she replied. And with a determined spirit, she stood up and agreed to try again. I held on to the back of her bike until she found the courage to say, ""Let's go!""
I spent the rest of the afternoon at the park watching a very brave little girl overcome a fear, and congratulating myself for being an independent single parent.
As we walked home, pushing the bike as we made our way along the sidewalk, she asked me about a conversation she'd overheard me having with my mother the night before.
""Why were you and Grandma arguing last night?""
""It's nothing."" I told her.
She shrugged  . ""Grandma said she just wanted you to find someone to love.""
""What Grandma wants is for some guy to break my heart again,"" I snapped.
""But Mom ...""
""You're too young to understand."" I told her.
She was quiet for the next few minutes. Then she looked up and in a small voice said, ""So I guess love isn't like a broken arm.""
Unable to answer, we walked the rest of the way in silence. When I got home, I let go and agreed to meet a man called Steve.
Steve was the man for me. We married less than a year later. It turned out my mother and my daughter were right. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?

Context: Barack Obama has never been shy about comparing himself with Abraham Lincoln. He did so when he announced his presidential election in Illinois, where both he and Lincoln served in the legislature  . ""The life of a tall, thin, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible."" Obama said. ""He tells us that there is power in words and that there is power in hope."" Such comparisons have continued on big and small occasions, but the most important similarity, in Obama's mind, is how he plans to govern if elected.
Obama says he admires Doris Kearns Goodwin' s wonderful Lincoln biography, Team of Rivals. ""He talks about it all the time."" says a top assistant. ""He is particularly interested in the idea that Lincoln successfully won the hearts of many people who had run against him for President, some of them even disagree with him firmly."" ""The lesson is that you shouldn't let your hatred   get in the way of hiring  ly the best people."" says Obama. ""I think American people are practical and so I have an interest in casting a wide net, seeking out people with a wide range of expert knowledge, including Republicans, for the highest positions in the government.""
""I don't want to have people who just agree with me."" He says. ""I want people who are continually pushing me forward and I'd be very interested in having those sorts of Republicans in my government, especially people who can speed up a responsible and logical conclusion to the Iraq war."" 
 Question:What can we infer from the passage? 
A. Obama is a member of the Republicans. 
B. The passage was written after the presidential election. 
C. Doris Goodwin is one of Obama's assistants. 
D. In the end Lincoln was able to get the support of the people who once hated him.

Context: Making a film takes a long time and is very hard work. Writing the story for the film may take many weeks. Shooting   the film often takes at least six months. Actors and camera men work from very early in the morning until late at night. Each scene has to be acted and re-acted, filmed and re-filmed, until it is just fine. Sometimes the same scene has to be acted many times.
The film studio is like a large factory, and the indoor stages are very big indeed. Scenery of all kinds is made in the studio. Churches, houses, and forests are all built of wood and cardboard. Several hundred people work together to make one film. Some of these people are the actors and actresses. The director of the film, however, is the most important person in a film studio. He decides how the scenes should be filmed and how the actors should act.
Most people go to see a film because they know the film stars are in it. Sometimes the film may be very poor. It is best to choose a film made by a good director. Some famous directors make their films very real; people feel that they themselves are among the people in the films. 
 Question:The best title for the passage is ""  _   "".

C. A Director 
D. Making a Film 
 Answer: D
Context: The big screen is never short of films about World WarII. When Nazi Germany is featured in these films, cruel Nazi officers and brutal concentration  camps most often represent it. But the new Hollywood movie Valkyrie tells a different story, ""a chapter of German history which is little known abroad"", according to the German Cultural Minister Bernd Neumann.
Valkyrie is based on a true incident that took place in 1944. Colonel  Stauffenberg had been a loyal soldier for his entire military career. However, after losing an eye, a hand, and three fingers in an Allied bombing,  _ . The destruction that his country had brought to its European neighbors had become too terrible for the colonel to bear in silence. He hoped that someone would find a way to stop Adolf Hitler, one of the most evil tyrants  the world has ever known. Realizing that time was running out, he decided that he must take action himself and joined the German resistance. These men drew up Operation Valkyrie, a plot to assassinate  Hitler and to overthrow his Nazi government from the inside. This plot is what the film is named after and focuses on.
The Hollywood star Tom Cruise plays the lead role. ""This was a very challenging film to make. We carried a huge responsibility to correctly portray history,"" Cruise said.
However, the production has drawn criticism for lacking depth and for simplifying the motives behind the plot. 
 Question:The following passage will probably talk about   _  . 
A. the reason why the film is named after Valkyrie 
B. the comments from the movie critics on Valkyrie 
C. the praises from audience after watching Valkyrie 
D. the importance of the role Cruise plays in Valkyrie

Context: What could make Michael Jordon, one of the greatest basketball players in history, shed tears?  It was when he became a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame on September 11. The hall is in Springfield, Massachusetts and honors the best basketball players, greatest coaches and other contributors to the game. ""The game of basketball has been everything to me ,"" said Jordan, 46. ""It is the place I have always gone when I needed to find comfort and peace.""
Jordan retired twice in his 15-year career, finishing with 32292 points, the third highest total points in NBA history behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone. His average of 30.12 points a game is the best in the League.
""One day you might look up and see me playing the game at 50,"" Jordan said. ""Because limits, like fears, are often just an illusion.""   In other words, it was motivation that made Jordan such a success..
A great career did not mean a smooth one. His high school coach cut him from the team in favor of a taller player when Jordan was in 10thgrade. His college coach wouldn't allow him on the cover of Sports Illustration in 1981 with North Carolina's four other players because Jordan was a freshman. In his first NBA All-Star game, older NBA stars wouldn't throw him the ball because of jealousy.
""That burned me up,"" Jordan said. ""But _ don't have to stop you. If you run into a wall, don't turn around and give up. Figure out how to climb it, go through it, or work around it."" 
 Question:When Jordan became a member of the Basketball Hall of Fame,  _ 
A. he found something more encouraging . 
B. he was so excited that he couldn't hold his tears back. 
C. he was happy and sad at the same time. 
D. he felt very comfortable and peaceful.

Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""
It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on. 
 Question:What can we learn from this passage? 
A. Jordan is not such a great person. 
B. Jordan deserves the admiration he had from others. 
C. Jordan is always ready to make friends with young people. 
D. Jordan is always misunderstood by expert reviewers.

Context: Jack thought himself a basketball fan. He watched quite a lot of American NBA basketball games. Not only did he watch them, he spent much of his free time playing on the court too. Then came the final year of his middle school. All of his regular teammates stopped showing up on the court because they were simply too busy preparing for the high school entrance exam to play. He was, of course, under much stress himself, like everyone else. A good exam result meant a good high school; a mediocre score meant a mediocre school. _ . However, he loved basketball so much that he still found time to play, this time with a group of guys who were said to have skipped classes before.
Some of his teachers started worrying about him. They asked his mother to go to school to let her know that Jack was hanging out with problem kids. When his mother returned home that day, she wanted to talk to Jack. Knowing the purpose of her visit to the school, Jack thought his mother would punish him for befriending those bad guys. To his surprise, his mother was not angry with him at all. She wanted to hear her son's side of the story. So Jack told his mother about what he knew of Simon and Peter. Simon's parents were badly ill; Peter's father had lost his job. They both seemed to Jack to be normal kids. Jack's mother thought for a moment, then went on to say that she was OK with her son playing with them and that she and her son should think of ways to help these kids. Soon Jack's mum introduced some part-time jobs to Simon and Peter, which they accepted. She believed in her son and cared about those who were less lucky.
Jack's basketball friends and he have left for different places, but they still keep in touch. He knows Peter is now a manager of a local bank. Simon is currently a freshman at a university. Sadly, it is impossible to get together to play basketball again, but whenever they get on the phone, they talk about it all the time. 
 Question:The main idea of the passage is to  _  . 
A. make friends with problem kids 
B. keep in touch with friends all the time 
C. try to understand children and help problem kids

Context: Police Officer Tidwell left the station just after 8 a.m.on Sunday June 4.He had spent aboring night on duty and was looking forward to his day of rest.By habit he took a short-cutdown the path behind Dugby Hall road and after a minute or two he saw a man climbing down a drainpipe   from an open bedroom window of Number 29.In silence,Tidwell crept into the garden.The man reached the ground and was dusting himself down when he felt his arm caught.
""It's 8:15 on a Sunday morning,""said the officer,""and this sort of thing seems an unlikely adventure at such a time.Would you mind explaining?""
The man was obviously scared but tried to keep calm.He said,""I know what you are thinking,officer,but it isn't true.This is a funny mistake.""
""It's part of my job to take an interest in unusual events.I think you've just left this house in a manner other than the customary one.That may be quite innocent,but I'd like to make sure.""Tidwell took out his notebook and a pen.""Name,address and occupation and then,please,tell me your story...""
""Charlie Crane,lorry driver,from Nottingham,51 Breton Street.My story...""
""Yes.What were you doing like a fly on that wall,Mr.Crane?""

""I see.Why didn't you miss it when you went to pay Mrs...What's her name?""
""I'd paid her last night.You've got to pay when you take the room,see?So I came rushing back,but it's Sunday,and she'd gone back to bed,and could I wake her?I rang the bell and banged on the front door for ten minutes before I came round here to the back and spotted my bedroom window still open.Up I went,then,up this pipe.It's a trick I learned in the army.She didn't make the bed,and money was still there.You know the rest,I hope you believe it because...""

Context: Dear Mr. Barton,
I am writing for the _   to inform you of our feelings about your act. We've really had enough of you. Although we have tried to speak to you politely on several occasions, you have always answered with a stream of verbal abuse .
Ever since you moved in three months ago, you have shown very little consideration for the other residents of this building, though many residents expressed their unhappiness with you. For the past six weekends, you have held very noisy parties, which have not finished until early the next morning. As you know, most of the people here are elderly or have very young children, and the noise keeps them awake all night. You don't have to be so noisy, do you? Last weekend the situation _ when two of your friends fought with each other on the first floor. The fighting was so bad that the police had to be called. What's more, your friends left the stairs in a terrible state --- they even broke two windows on their way out! We feel that we can't bear this type of act.
We strongly demand that you pay for this damage to the window soon. If you don't and you carry on being a nuisance . We will kick you out! Legal steps will be taken if necessary.
Yours sincerely 
 Question:Why were the police called? 
A. Because Mr. Barton broke two windows. 
B. Because Mr. Barton made too much noise. 
C. Because Mr. Barton's friends fought. 
D. Because Mr. Barton beat a child and an old man.

Context: It must have been around nine o'clock when I drove back home from work because it was already dark. As I came near to the gates I turned off the head lights of the car so as to prevent the beam from swinging   through the window and waking Jack, who shared the house with me. But I needn't have done so. I noticed that his light was still on, so he was awake anyway--unless he had fallen asleep while reading. I put the car away and went up the steps.
Then I opened the door quietly and went to Jack's room. He was in bed awake, but he didn't even turn towards me.
""What's up, Jack?"" I asked.
""For God's sake, don't make a noise,"" he said.
The way he spoke reminded me of someone in pain who is afraid to talk in case he does himself serious injury.
""Take your shoes off, Neville,"" Jack said.
I thought that he must be ill and that I had better give way to him to keep him happy. ""There is a snake here,"" he explained. ""It's asleep between the sheets. I was lying on my back reading when I saw it.I knew that moving was _ . I could not have moved even I'd wanted to."" I realized that he was serious. ""I was depending on you to call a doctor as soon as you came home,"" Jack went on. ""It has not bitten me yet but I dare not do anything to upset it. It might wake up. I'm sick of this,"" he said.""I took it for granted that you would have come home an hour ago.""
There was no time to argue or apologize for being late.I looked at him as encouraging as I could and went to telephone the doctor. 
 Question:When he got home, Neville found that   _  . 
A. Jack had fallen asleep while reading 
B. Jack had been reading for some time

 Answer: C
Context: Scattered  throughout the various reports on sleep research are several that describe some unusual behavior by people who are sleepwalking. These include eating, making phone calls and even murder.
Now, there's a new case appearing in one more study on this strange phenomenon: sleep e-mailing. In an article published in journal Sleep Medicine, prefix = st1 /SetonHallUniversityresearchers document the following case of a 44-year-old woman:
This woman received a puzzling phone call from a friend who said she was accepting her dinner invitation -- an invitation that the woman could not remember having made.
The friend reminded the woman of the e-mail she had sent the night before -- an e-mail of which the woman also had no recollection . However, a quick search through her sent e-mail folder did turn up one strange e-mail. She had apparently sent it to her friend -- at 11:47 the previous night.
The puzzling message said: ""I don't get it. Please explain Lucy! Come tomorrow and sort this out! Dinner and drinks, 4 pm? Wine and caviar   to bring only. Everything else, a guess?
There were two other e-mails sent to her friend at 11:50pm and 11:53 pm, each of which seemed to be written in a strange language, full of capitalization errors and phrases that didn't make sense. According to Dr Fouzia Siddiqui, lead author of the case study, this particular sleepwalking case was unique and was the first and only published account of ""sleep e-mailing"". 
""Sleepwalking has occurred in the past where people would undertake other activities such as cooking or moving furniture around,"" Siddiqui said. "" But this case is unique in that she wasn't just sleeping but doing complex things like turning on her computer, remembering her user name and password and typing entire e-mails.""
Just what is sleepwalking? It is actually a kind of sleep disorder. Studies have found that somewhere between 5 and 10 percent of people are sleepwalkers. 
It comes from a mixture of wakefulness and non-REM   sleep. Sleepwalkers can carry out complex behavior such as driving, walking, e-mailing and telephoning in a sleep-like state. People with high levels of stress and anxiety, or those who have a family history of sleepwalking are more likely to experience it. 
 Question:What is the main idea of the passage? 
A. It analyzes what sleepwalking is and its effects on people. 
B. It explains to readers why and how sleepwalking forms. 
C. It mainly reports on a recent unique case of sleepwalking. 
D. It tells about various kinds of sleepwalking there are.

Context: Students who get tired of looking at the four walls of a classroom might like to take the nature course being offered by Carvel College again this summer. Groups of about a dozen students each, led by an experienced guide, will go on ten-day camping trips to the mountains to study the plants and animals that grow and live there.
Students carry their own things, which includes sleeping bags, warm clothing, food and water, and other useful tools. And what do the students do all day? Well, as soon as the sun comes up, they eat breakfast and start climbing up the mountain trail to the next campground, which is five to ten miles away. As the students take notes, the guide points out different plants and animals alongside the trail. The climb is usually over by early afternoon, so the group spends the rest of the day resting or swimming in a mountain lake. Before dinner each night, they all come together and discuss the day's activities.
At the end of the course, the students write reports using the information they have collected. But they don't mind at all. What they do mind is leaving the beauty of the wilderness and the good friends they've made to return to their normal lives in the city. 
 Question:What do the students have to do before dinner? 
A. Wash themselves up in a mountain lake. 
B. Attend classes by the experienced guide. 
C. Write about what they see along the trail. 
D. Review what they learn through discussion. 
 Answer: D
Context: What do we do when we go camping? First, we think of a plan. We take food, clothes, a knife, and things for cooking and eating. We take things to keep us away from insects and the sun. Then we put everything into the car and we drive to the woods. We look for a place for campers   and we look for a good place for our tent . The place should have a lot of air. This will keep some insects   away. High land with water on both sides of it is good. Then we put up our tent. We put everything into the tent, and we are ready for fun. We can swim in the lake, walk in the woods, climb a mountain, row a boat, or go fishing. In the evening we come back to the tent, we build a big fire because it can keep the insects away. We sit around the fire and talk. We may tell interesting stories or we may sing songs. At night we lie down on the grass. We can look up at the stars. It is a busy day, so we try to go to sleep early. Everything is dark. Everything is quiet. We hope we won't hear music from the radio in the next tent. We hope it won't rain. 
 Question:We go to camp   _  . 
A. by bus 
B. by car 
C. by bike 
D. on foot

Context: When doctors urge overweight kids to pick up more activities,reading probably isn't what they have in mind.    Yet a new study by fatness researchers at Duke University finds that the simple act of reading--depending on the choice of material--can cause weight loss in teenage girls.
The study's experimental group included 31 fat girls aged 9 to 13,who took part in the Healthy Lifestyles Program at Duke Children's Hospital. The girls read a novel called Lake Rescue,whose protagonist   is an overweight teenager who struggles with low selfesteem,feelings of loneliness and teasing because of her size. A group of 33 girls read a different book called Charlotte in Paris,which did not have an overweight character,and another group of 17 girls read neither book.
At the end of the sixmonth experiment,all the girls who read books had lost weight,but the girls who read Lake Rescue lost more. They lowered their body mass index (BMI) by 0.71,compared with 0.33 in the Charlotte group,an average 0.05 increase among the nonreaders.
The idea behind the study,says Dr Sarah Armstrong,director of Healthy Lifestyles,was to find a way to encourage the girls without adopting the restrictive and often authoritative voice of so many other nutrition and diet programs. Lake Rescue was the perfect instrument,says Armstrong;it presents a likable character to whom the girls could relate and whom they could learn from. As the book progresses,its protagonist learns to make healthier lifestyle choices and finds an adviser to help keep her on track. Armstrong says,"" _ learns that she can become healthier,and the 'I can do it' feeling resonates   with the teenage girls.""

Context: For many years, I was convinced that my suffering was due to my size. I believed that when the weight disappeared, it would take old wounds, hurts and rejections with it.
Many weight-conscious people also mistakenly believe that changing our bodies will fix _ . Perhaps our mistake is believing that being thin equals being loved, being special, and being cherished. We fantasize   about what it will be like when we reach the long-awaited goal .We work very hard to realize this dream. Then, at last, we find ourselves there.
But we often gain back what we have lost. Even so, we continue to believe that next time it will be different. Next time, we will keep it off. Next time, being thin will finally fulfill its promise of everlasting happiness, self-worth, and, of course, love.
It took me a long time to realize that there was something more for me to learn about beauty. Beauty standards vary with culture. In Samoa a woman is not considered attractive unless she weighs more than 200 pounds. More importantly, if it's happiness that we want, why not put our energy there rather than on the size of our body? Why not look inside? Many of us strive hard to change our body, but in vain. We have to find a way to live comfortably inside our body and make friends with and cherish ourselves. When we change our attitudes towards ourselves, the whole world changes. 
 Question:The passage tries to stress the importance of   _  . 
A. body size 
B. different beauty standards 
C. culture difference 
D. attitudes towards life

Context: The sun had gone behind a cloud. I was very tired and wanted nothing in the world so much as to be at home. At last I got to the gate of Hide Park. But this was worse than ever; there were buses there--high and terribly red cars, taxis and still more buses in an endless line. Everywhere there were people hurrying past or waiting to get into the buses, while I stood lost in the middle of them.
I was ready to cry. In despair, I crossed the street on to an ""island"", where I found a policeman. I took my last bit of courage in both hands and said, ""Please, sir, where is Addison Road?"" He began to explain, but when he saw that I couldn't understand he became helpless, too. ""Are you French at school?"" A few minutes later, he smiled and raised his hand. How wonderful!

Context: A girl who graduated from a world-famous university wanted to do translation work for authority leaders. She was so happy when she entered the British embassy . She thought it was the greatest happiness in her life as many graduates wanted to get that job while she was one of the few people who got it!
              But when she started her new job, she realized that it was just a job of answering calls and recording staff members' starting and quitting times. It was unappreciated and was supposed to have no future. However, she didn't feel sad about it. She learnt how to love the job. And she loved it when she was working. The names and phone numbers of the staff members were written down on the notebook so that she could remember them. When the phone calls came in, she picked it up as soon as possible. When someone asked her about who was not in the office, she would answer them the right name and the time when they left. Nobody could do that except her.
              Her wonderful performance not only received the compliments from the embassy's staff, but also the employees from the local government. And a leader of a famous company in Britain was also impressed by it and invited her to work for him. After that she became a personal translator of an important leader from Britain and appreciated by the foreigners.
              We cannot choose our destiny , but we can choose the attitude with which we face our life. Maybe the attitude could change our destiny. If we cry to life, life will be gray. If we smile to life, life will smile to us, too.

Context: Americans plan parties for many reasons. As in other cultures, many Americans attend parties for weddings and religious or national holidays. But some parties are especially American. For example, a group of neighbors may gather on their street to eat food, play music and visit with one another. This is called a block party. A woman might invite a group of women to a party called a baby shower for a friend who is about to give birth. Guests bring presents for the new baby.
Americans also attend tailgate parties. A tailgate is the back end of a truck or other vehicle that opens down. The tailgate parties are a big part of sports culture in the United States. Friends bring food and drink to a sports event. They eat together in the parking area of the sports stadium.
Birthday parties are also very popular. Many parents organize a party for their child around a theme. Birthday parties usually include gifts and a birthday cake with candles. In many parts of the United States, cupcakes have become a popular replacement for cakes.
Birthday parties can be low cost or very costly. Some parents take their children's birthday parties very seriously, even when the child is too young to fully understand the celebration.
One group of parents started a website called Birthdays Without Pressure. They decided that some parents were under too much social pressure to plan costly parties for their children. The group sees this movement as an example of America's culture of ""too much stuff"". The group's website gives suggestions on how to keep birthday celebrations simple, meaningful and fun without spending a lot of money. Their advice may be very helpful during this period of economic recession  .

Context: Let's Learn More about Each Other
Are the lives of city kids the same as those in villages? In many ways, they are very different. But what are the differences?
Hu Peng of Wuhan and four friends decided to find them out. Earlier this month, they lived for a week in Caidian, a village near Wuhan. Hu and his friends went door to door in Caidian and asked the kids there lots of questions. They wanted to learn more about village kids' everyday lives, so they asked these questions like --Do your parents teach you how to do housework? How much money do you usually spend on dinner? What would you do if a thief   came into your house? They also asked 150 city kids the same questions.What's the Difference?
Last week the team gave a report to their class. There are lots of differences between children's lives in cities and those in villages. The biggest difference is independence. Hu's team said that 60 percent of city kids couldn't do much housework, but 90 percent of village kids could care for themselves.
City kids told Hu they cared about school a lot, and they had no time for washing clothes or making their beds. Village kids said they helped their parents with housework a lot. They cooked, did some cleaning and fed animals. Hu's team also found that village kids had less pocket money  . Many never used computers. They played in rivers or on mountains. Some didn't really like to make new friends.
Hu and his friends said their trip gave them more self-confidence   because they were doing something by themselves. But _ also made them a little worried because they saw they still had a lot to learn. ""When we grow up, our parents can't take care of us,"" said Hu. ""We have to learn to take care of ourselves."" Shen Guanquan, one of Hu's friends said, ""When children learn to care for themselves, they learn to do lots of things."" 
 Question:How many city kids went to learn about village kids' everyday lives? 
A. Three. 
B. Four. 
C. Five. 
D. Six.

But he always turned that into a joke.
One day Jim was invited to appear on the TV. There was a show for the oldest radio employees. For the first time his fans, who only knew Jim by his voice, would see him. Before the recording of the show, the director came to Jim and asked, ""Usually you arrive on time, but today you are 10 minutes late. It's not terrible, but I still want to know why.""
""You see,"" Jim answered, ""at the last moment when I was already dressed up, I noticed that I didn't have new socks. For the first time I was invited to the television, and I thought that simply wearing clean socks was not enough. So I needed to go to the store for new socks.""
The director was surprised. He asked, ""Why do you need new socks? You could have come without the socks because we will be filming you only over the waist.""
"" You see, to be perfect, I need to feel myself perfect in everything, starting with the shirt and finishing with the pen in my pocket,"" Jim said. ""And if my socks have holes in them or my shoes are dirty, I'm not spotless anymore. And it may make me less confident."" 
 Question:For Jim, being perfect in everything   _  . 
A. brings him success 
B. makes him popular 
C. gives him confidence 
D. is difficult but necessary

Context: A new study has found that the best way to make yourself feel happier is to think of something good that happened to you the day before.
Volunteers who were asked to remember a pleasant event from past 24 hours began to feel happier right away.Other activities such as saying ""Thank you"" and smiling also made volunteers feel happier, but not as much.
Professor Richard Wiseman of Hertfordshire University planned the study.He got 26,000 people to go online to try out a few different activities to make them feel happier.They were told to be nice, remember a pleasant event from the day before, give thanks or smile for 15 seconds twice a day.The volunteers did these activities for one week.
The result showed that thinking about one good thing that had happened the day before worked the best for making people happier.(146 words)

Context: Last summer, when Amanda R of Anaheim Hills, California, was running on a cross-country course with her team, she blacked out. ""I got really dizzy,"" she says. ""I was out for a few minutes."" At first, Amanda thought she was just tired and didn't think she had a health problem. She did go to the emergency room, where she was fine after tests, but she fainted   again several days later as she was talking with her coach. Another doctor guessed that Amanda had blacked out ""because we were in heat so much with not enough water and not enough of the right kind of foods"".
Teens often don't want to stop and take a break or don't notice when they start to feel bad, doctors say. However, paying attention if you're not feeling well is important, as Amanda learned.
As a result, Amanda has changed her habits. ""I drink a lot more water,"" she says. ""And put more salt in my diet. I'm eating more balanced meals."" Amanda advises teen athletes to trust their coaches and speak up when they're not feeling well. ""And recognize the difference between when you're tired and when there's something really wrong.""

Thank you very much for doing the special operation ."" Mr Lee was moved by Sam. When he was leaving, Sam said, ""Please don't tell Jason about it."" ""Well...Well...OK,"" Mr Lee replied.

Context: Each week, this program explains the many meanings of English expressions. Today's expressions include a very important word--""heart"". We will try to ""get to the heart of the matter"" to better understand the most important thing about words and their stories. So ""take heart."" Have no fear about learning new expressions. Besides, popular English words can be fun. There is no need for a ""heavy heart."" Such feelings of sadness would only ""break my heart,"" or make me feel unhappy and hopeless.
Now, let us suppose you and I were speaking freely about something private. We would be having a ""heart to heart"" discussion. I might speak from ""the bottom of my heart, "" or say things honestly and truthfully. I might even ""open up my heart"" to you and tell you a secret. I would speak with ""all my heart"".
When a person shares her feelings freely and openly like this, you might say she ""wears her heart on her sleeve"". Her emotions are not protected.
If we had an honest discussion, both of us would know that the other person's ""heart is in the right place."" For example, I would know that you are a ""kind-hearted"" and well-meaning person. And, if you are a very good person, I would even say that you have ""a heart of gold."" However, you might have a ""change of heart"" based on what I tell you. Our discussion might cause you to change the way you feel about something.
But, let us suppose you get angry over what I tell you. Or worse, you feel no sympathy or understanding for me or my situation. If this happens, I might think that you have a ""heart of stone."" And, if you say something to make me frightened or worried, my ""heart might stand still"". 
 Question:From the above passage we may see   _  . 
A. English words can all be used differently 
B. some phrases do not have a fixed meaning 
C. languages change with the time 
D. the same word may have various meanings

Context: Zoe Chambers was a successful PR(Public Relations) consultant and life was going well--she had a great job, a beautiful life in London. Then one evening in June last year, she received a text message telling her she was out of work. ""The first two weeks were the most difficult to live through,"" she said.

Context: In ancient Egypt, the pharaoh treated the poor message runner like a prince when he arrived at the palace, if he brought good news. However, if the exhausted  runner had the misfortune to bring the pharaoh unhappy news, his head was cut off
Shades of that spirit spread over today's conversations. Once a friend and I packed up some peanut, butter and sandwiches for an outing. As we walked light-heartedly out the door, picnic basket in hand, a smiling neighbor looked up at the sky and said, ""Oh boy, bad day for a picnic. The weatherman says it's going to rain."" I wanted to strike him in the face with the peanut butter and sandwiches. Not for his stupid weather report, but for his smile.
Several months ago I was racing to catch a bus. As I breathlessly put my handful of cash across the Greyhound counter, the sales agent said with a broad smile. ""Oh that bus left five minutes ago."" Dreams of head cutting!
It's not the news that makes someone angry. It's the unsympathetic attitude with which it's delivered. Everyone must give bad news from time to time, and winning professionals do it with the proper attitude. A doctor advising a patient that she needs an operation does it in a caring way. A boss informing an employee he didn't get the job takes on a sympathetic tone. Big winners know, when delivering any bad news, they should share the feeling of the receiver.
Unfortunately, many people are not aware of this. When you're tired from a long flight, has a hotel clerk cheerfully said that your room isn't ready yet? When you had your heart set on the toast beef, has your waiter merrily told you that he just served the last piece? It makes you, as traveler or diner, want to land your fist fight on their unsympathetic faces.
Had my neighbor told me of the upcoming rainstorm with sympathy, I would have appreciated his warning. Had the Greyhound salesclerk sympathetically informed me that my bus had already left, I probably would have said, ""Oh, that's all right. I'll catch the next one."" Big winners, when they hear bad news, deliver bombs with the emotion thebombarded  person is sure to have . 
 Question:What is the main idea of the text? 
A. Delivering bad news properly is important in communication. 
B. Helping others sincerely is the key to business success. 
C. Receiving bad news requires great courage. 
D. Learning ancient traditions can be useful. 
 Answer: A
Context: Danger-junkie orangutans  in Borneo climb dead trees and shake then until they begin to fall. They scream with excitement as they cling to the falling tree. Just before the tree hits the ground the orangutans leap to another tree or vine, narrowly escaping death. While no one cab ask orangutans if they enjoy it as a person playing an extreme sport, one animal behaviorist sees this monkey fun as a bit of harmless thrill-seeking.
A growing number of scientists agree that animals are conscious and capable of experiencing basic emotions , such as happiness, sadness, boredom or depression. A few scientists even see the possibility for higher animal emotions like love, jealousy and spite.
Five years ago, behaviorist and animal-rights activist Dr. Jonathan Balcombe stood on a Virginia hotel balcony watching two crows intimately groom   each other in the comfort of an abandoned billboard. He felt that the birds liked what they were doing, even if engaged in a natural, beneficial act, such as picking parasites   off the other's feathers. That moment changed the way he would view animals forever and led to a book, ""Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good"", which is filled with hundreds of examples of animals living it up thanks to developed senses of touch, taste, sight, sound and smell.
Balcombe recounts a favorite example of Kenyan hippos   having high-end spa treatment in a fresh water spring. They splay their toes, open their mouths wide and wait for a school of cleaner fish to remove parasites and slough off dead skin, he recalls. Balcombe knows that the hippos and the fish both benefit from this arrangement. ""My interpretation is that it is also enjoyable for them ,"" he says. 
 Question:We can conclude from the passage that   _  . 
A. only a few animals have emotions 
B. Balcombe's theory is not supported by other scientists 
C. Balcombe has watched a lot of animals showing emotions 
D. Balcombe can understand animal language

Context: Are you in a bad mood? Don't worry! According to a new Australian study, a bad mood can actually be good for you. The study showed that being sad could help people to judge others more correctly and was also good for the memory.
The study was carried out by Professor Joseph Forgas at the University of New South Wales.""People in a bad mood paid more attention to the people and things around them than happy people .Happy people were more likely to believe anything they were told,""said Forgas

People in a bad mood were also less likely to make mistakes when they were asked to remember the things that they saw.
The study also showed that sad people were better at talking about their thoughts in written style. In fact, the study said that a slightly bad mood could help to make communication more successful.

Context: The prisoner had waited many months for help, but none had come. Now he felt he would do something to gain his freedom, to be free again to go about the world as he wished. But he could think of no way to run away.
He spent many hours thinking of his life before he was captured, regretting the mistakes he had made and dreaming of the joys he had known. And over and over he said to himself that he was being punished for no reason. He was guilty of no crime, but he had not been given a chance to explain the events which made him guilty.
Then one night the guard who sat outside the prisoner's door fell asleep. When he noticed this, the prisoner was struck by a feeling of hope. Perhaps he could steal the keys while the guard was sleeping.
Silently the prisoner moved toward the guard. Very gently he lifted the ring of keys from the guard's belt. Then he turned and crawled toward the door. Could he work the lock from the inside? The key turned and the door was opened. Within two minutes he had crossed the yard and climbed the wall. Then he ran across the field, free at last, a smile of joy beginning to spread across his face. 
 Question:The prisoner had a wish  _  . 
A. to be excused 
B. to go away freely with his family 
C. to be a free man in the prison 
D. to be helped out of the prison

Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""
It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on. 
 Question:That man called after reading about what Jordan did to a disabled child because he wanted to   _  . 
A. become famous himself 
B. know why Jordan appeared in a poor area 
C. let the author know that Jordan was not that nice 
D. offer another example to show that Jordan was a nice man

Context: Tyler was a troublesome student. He sat in the back row. Every time I called him to answer questions, he'd reply with a flip answer. If he got it wrong, he would get very angry.
Usually kids could sit quietly in class. However, Tyler was just loud. One day, Tyler was talking while I was teaching. I said to him, ""Tyler, why not join in our discussion instead of having one of your own?"" He got up from his chair, pushed it over, and shouted something I can't remember. I sent him to the office and he received a week's out-of-school punishment.
The week was a wonderful time for me, but when it came to an end, I began to feel worried. So I came up with a plan. On the day of his return, I told him I wanted to start over with him. If he felt like he was going to lose control in class, he could step outside the door for a moment.
From then on, Tyler was a changed student in my classroom. In fact he was a smart child and he even stopped a fight between two students one day. And he never used the privilege to leave the class for a moment. I believe that just letting him decide for himself made all the difference.
When the year was over, he wrote me a thank-you note about how good the year had been for him. I still have it today and find it very moving to reread when I get stressed about teaching.

A. sitting in the back row

C. stopping a fight between two students 
D. not listening to teachers in class

Context: As a funny student, Brian loved watching comedies   best and hoped to become a comedy actor one day. When he heard about the talent show   to be held at this school, Brian decided to take part in it.
He had never acted in public before, and he was very excited. But some students laughed at him. ""You are not funny but silly,"" Ken, one of his classmates, said to his face. ""No one will like what you do,"" another boy also said to him, loudly.
Brian couldn't understand why they were so unkind to him. For a moment, he thought about giving up the show. But he remembered how much his friends liked his jokes, and also his teachers said he was very funny. So he decided to prepare for the show.
Brian did a great job at the talent show. Everyone loved his performance  , and he won the first prize! His teachers and friends were proud of him. Even so, Ken told Brian that he was not funny, and that he would never be successful. Brian didn't understand why Ken said so, but he realized that it had nothing to do with him. He confidently continued to work towards his dream.
As the years went on, Brian met more people like Ken. ""You'll do a terrible job,"" they said to him. Luckily, most people encouraged him and some helped him to become even funnier. He got a lot of chances to perform in movies. He was even invited to appear on television. His fans thanked him because his comedies made them feel good when they were unhappy.

Context: No one gets through life without experiencing many disappointments. Strangely, though, most people seem unprepared for disappointment and react to it in negative ways. They feel depressed or try to escape from their troubles instead of using disappointment as an opportunity for growth.
One negative reaction to disappointment is depression. A woman trying to win a promotion, for example, works hard for over a year in her department. Helen is so sure she will get the promotion. However, the boss names one of Helen's co-workers for the spot. Deeply depressed, Helen loses her enthusiasm for her job and can barely force herself to show up every day. Helen tells herself that she is a failure and that doing a good job just isn't worth the work.
Another negative reaction to disappointment is the desire to escape. Kevin fails to get into the college his brother is attending, the college that was the focus of all his dreams, and decides to escape his disappointment. Why worry about college at all? Instead, he covers up his real feelings by giving up on his school-work and getting completely involved with friends, parties, and ""good times"".
The positive way to react to disappointment is to use it as a chance for growth. This isn't easy, but it's the only useful way to deal with an inevitable part of life. Helen, the woman who was not promoted, could have handled her disappointment by looking at other options. If her boss did not recognize her talent and hard work, perhaps she could transfer to another department. Or she could ask the boss how to improve her performance so that she could prepare for the next promotion. Kevin, the boy who didn't get into the college of his choice, should look into other schools. Going to another college may encourage him to be his own person, step out of his brother's shadow, and realize that being turned down by one college isn't a final judgment on his abilities or potential.
Disappointments are unwelcome, but regular visitors to everyone's life. We can feel depressed about them or we can try to escape from them. The best thing, though, is to accept a disappointment and then try to use it somehow: Step over the unwelcome visitor on the doorstep and get on with life.

Right after they came into the classroom. The professor handed out the papers. There were only five questions on it.
Three hours passed. Then the professor began to collect the papers. The students no longer looked confident. On their faces was nervous expression .

""Three? Two?"" The students moved restlessly in their seats. ""One, then? Certainly somebody has finished one."" But the class kept silent. The professor said, ""That is exactly what I expected. I just want to make you know clearly that even though you have completed four years of engineering. There are still many things about the subject you don't know. These questions you could not answer are common in everyday practice."" Then, smiling, he added, ""You will all pass this course, your education has just begun.""

Context: Our daughter Kerrin, a student at Boston University, had been home for a week-end visit, and I dropped her off at the bus station just in time for her back to college. After Kerrin's bus had gone and I was driving away, I noticed that she had left her purse on the passenger seat. Worried that she would arrive in Boston without money or keys to her room, I called my wife, Bette Jean, on the car phone, explaining why I would be late.

The driver asked me to wave out of my window to show where I was. Then he pulled over at a rest stop, and I did the same. Kerrin jumped off the bus, and I handed her the purse and went on my way.

Context: Bobbi Kristina Brown's family has been gathered around her since she was hospitalized on Saturday after being found unconscious in the bathtub of her suburban Atlanta townhome.
Whitney Houston's only child is now at Emory University Hospital and is still fighting for her life, as a family statement said on Monday.
Nothing has changed, despite reports that are popping up and painting a more serious picture.
Fox News reported Wednesday that the situation is horrific. ""It's now a matter of when the family wants to let go and accept that she's pretty much not going to make it,"" a source told FOX411. ""They've left it up to the family as to how long they want to keep her alive.""
People Magazine is also reporting that a doctor told Brown's family on Wednesday that nothing more could be done. ""Everyone is coming to the hospital to say goodbye,"" said a family member.
And the Daily Mail says Brown has been taken off life support.
But Bobby Brown issued a statement late Thursday denying these reports.
""If we issued a statement every time the media published a false report regarding this matter, that's all we would be doing 24 hours a day. This is false, just as is the vast majority of the other reporting that is currently taking place,"" he said, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.
A source close to the family tells USA TODAY that it's wrong to say the family is gathering to say goodbye, because the family has been there since the beginning, so nothing is any different today for them.
Also, Brown is ""not brain dead,"" as has been reported.
And, as for other stories saying that the Houston family is feuding with Bobbi Kristina's dad, Bobby Brown? Those aren't true either. They ""are NOT fighting,"" says our source. 
 Question:Which can be the best title of the passage? 
A. An Accident In The Bathtub 
B. Kristina, We're Still Praying And Waiting On A Miracle 
C. False Reports From Different News Media 
D. Bobbi Kristina's Final Days 
 Answer: C
Context: She almost did not run. Christine Williams admits that now. She could barely put one foot after another following the wake  for her sister, who had died in an automobile accident. But she did run. With the cheers of friends and strangers reaching her heart, Williams set a C.W. Post record in Boston. Now she will run again, in the national Division II cross-country championships in Evansville, Ind. She wanted to be sure she was doing the right thing by running. She was the middle of three sisters, between Kerry, who is 25, and Jennifer, who was 18.
Just going through any motions was hard enough, but Christine Williams wanted to know if she should put on her uniform and her shoes and run through the woods on an autumn afternoon, in the awful gaping time between her sister's wake and her funeral. ""I kind of got upset beforehand."" Williams admitted. Not a chatterbox under normal conditions, she now holds herself the best way she can, the fewer words the better. She almost walked away from the start line. But her friend Angela Toscano, who had flown up to Boston with her, directly from the wake, was standing near the line and talked her through it. ""She said my sister would have wanted me to run."" Christine said. And that was enough to get her started.
The accident happened just after midnight on Nov, 4. Four young women were driving in an unfamiliar area of Long Island in Eastport, N.Y., when one of them apparently ran a yield sign, and the car was hit by another vehicle. Heather Brownrigg and Jennifer Williams died, and their friends April Brown and Kaci Moran were treated at a hospital and released.
The crash made the papers. April Brown was charged with drunken driving and driving without a license.
The wake began on Nov. 6. The next day Christine was to run with the Post cross-country team at the regional meet. Rich Degnan, the Post coach,""and Post officials offered a car service and tickets on the last flight-to Boston for Christine and Toscano. When they arrived at the hotel, the entire team was waiting up for her.
Everybody knew about it at the regional meet. Degnan had to arrange for the flexibility of an alternate, just in case Christine could not go. Several times during the race, Christine felt she could not continue. But then she heard her friends and all those other people, those strangers from other colleges, calling her name. She thought about Jennifer. And she ran. She finished fourth in 22 minutes 58 seconds, breaking the Post record for the 6-kilometer distance by 15 seconds. And although the Post team didn't qualify for the nationals, Christine did. 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that   _  . 
A. Christine's two sisters were killed in the accident 
B. Christine's athletic performance stood out in the race 
C. Christine flew to Boston after her sister's funeral 
D. Christine broke the Post record in national meet in Boston

Context: Good evening,ladies and gentlemen and welcome to this of the Box Bill Tennis Club. It's good to see so many of you here this evening. I'm sure you're all enjoyed the fine food,and that you are ready to hear our guest speaker. 
Ladies and gentlemen,we're pleased to welcome our most famous club champion,Billy Rogers,to our meeting. 
Billy needs no introduction because he is one of the most well-known tennis players in our country. However,I must mention a few things about him. Billy has won the US Open three times,and Wimbledon twice. He has won more tennis tournaments than any player from this country. He has been ranked number one in the world in both singles and doubles. He has played in the Davis Cup and the Hopman Cup for his country. His Wimbledon victory two years ago has been called one of the bravest in the modern time. Had he not been injured,he would undoubtedly have won a third Wimbledon Championship. Billy is regarded by many as perhaps the finest player ever in international tennis. 
But of course Billy is much more than a tennis champion. 
He is like an ambassador for the sport and for his country. He has done great work to help children around the world,and his generosity to children's charity funds is well known. 
And of course,Billy is the most successful graduate of our club. He won the club championships when he was twelve--yes,at only twelve. And Billy has not forgotten where it all started. That's why he accepted our invitation to speak to us tonight. We're proud to have played a small part in Billy's success. 
Won't you please give a big hand to our own Billy Rogers? 
 Question:How many kinds of famous tournaments did Billy Rogers takes part in according to the text? 
A. Two. 
B. Four. 
C. Three. 
D. Six. 
 Answer: B
Context: An invisible smile
Mr. Dawson was an old grouch  , and everyone in town knew it. Kids knew not to go into his yard to pick a delicious apple, even off the ground, because old Dawson, they said, would come after you with his ball bullet gun.
One Friday, 12-year-old Janet was going to stay all night with her friend Amy. They had to walk by Dawson's house on the way to Amy's house, but as they got close Janet saw him sitting on his front porch and suggested they cross over to the other side of the street. Like most of the children, she was scared of the old man because of the stories she'd heard about him.
Amy said not to worry, Mr. Dawson wouldn't hurt anyone. When they got close enough, Dawson looked up with his usual frown, but when he saw it was Amy, a broad smile changed his entire face as he said, ""Hello Miss Amy. I see you've got a little friend with you today.""
Amy smiled back and told him Janet was staying overnight and they were going to listen to music and play games. Dawson told them that sounded fun, and offered them each a fresh picked apple off his tree. 
When they got out of Dawson on earshot, Janet asked Amy, ""Everyone says he's the meanest man in town. How come was he so nice to us?""
Amy explained that when she first started walking past his house he wasn't very friendly and she was afraid of him, but she pretended he was wearing an invisible smile and so she always smiled back at him. It took a while, but one day he half-smiled back at her.
After some more time, he started smiling real smiles and then started talking to her. 
""An invisible smile?"" questioned Janet.
""Yes,"" answered Amy, ""my grandma told me that if I pretended I wasn't afraid and pretended he was smiling an invisible smile at me and I smiled back at him, that sooner or later he would really smile. Grandma says smiles are contagious.""
However, it's so easy to get caught up in everyday life that we forget how simple it can be to bring cheer to ourselves and others. If we remember what Amy's grandma said, that everyone wears an invisible smile, we too will find that most people can't resist our smile after a while. 
 Question:Amy told Janet not to worry because she knew Mr. Dawson would   _  . 
A. invite them to his yard for fun 
B. give them each a fresh picked apple 
C. not aim at them with his gun 
D. be friendly to them 
 Answer: D
Context: One evening after dinner, Mr. and Mrs. Tisich called a family meeting. ""We've had to make a difficult decision,"" Mr. Tisich announced. ""You see, your mother has been offered a post as co-director of a television station in Chicago. Unfortunately, the station is not here. After thinking long and hard about it, we've concluded that the right decision is to move to Chicago."" Marc looked shocked, while his sister Rachel breathlessly started asking when they'd be moving. ""It's surprising, but exciting!"" she said. Marc simply said, ""We can't go--I can't leave all my friends. I'd rather stay here and live with Tommy Lyons!""
The Tisichs hoped that by the time they moved in August, Marc would grow more used to the idea of leaving. However, he showed no signs of accepting the news, refusing to pack his belongings. When the morning of the move arrived, Marc was nowhere to be found. His parents called Tommy Lyon's house, but Mrs. Lyons said she hadn't seen Marc. Mrs. Tisich became increasingly concerned, while her husband felt angry with their son for behaving so irresponsibly.
What they didn't know was that Marc had started walking over to Tommy's house, with a faint idea of hiding in Lyons's attic  for a few days. But something happened on the way as Marc walked past all the familiar landscape of the neighborhood: the fence that he and his mother painted, the tree that he and his sister used to climb, the park where he and his father often took evening walks together. How much would these mean without his family, who make them special in the first place? Marc didn't take the time to answer that question but instead hurried back to his house, wondering if there were any moving cartons the right size to hold his record collection. 
 Question:The reason for Marc's going home was that  _  . 
A. he did not want to be left behind 
B. he realized his family was important to him 
C. he hoped to reach an agreement with his parents 
D. he wished to be a more responsible person

Context: When I stepped out the plane from Miami into Charlotte, North Carolina, airport for a connecting flight home, I immediately knew something was wrong. Lots of desperate people crowded the terminal. I quickly learned that flights headed to the Northeast were called off because of a storm. The earliest they could get us out of Charlotte was Tuesday. It was Friday. A gate agent stood on the counter and shouted, ""Don't ask us for help! We cannot help you!""
I joined a crowd that ran from terminal to terminal in search of a flight out. Eventually, I found six strangers willing to rent a van with me. We drove through the night to Washington, where I took a train the rest of the way to Providence.
The real problem, of course, is that incidents like this happen every day, to everyone who flies, more and more often. It really gets to me, though, because for eight years I was on the other side, as a flight attendant for Trans-World Airlines (TWA).
I know the days are gone when attendants could be written up if we did not put the lines napkins with the TWA logo in the lower right-hand corner of the first-class diners' trays. As are the days when there were three dinner options on flights from Boston to Los Angeles in economy class. When, once, stuck on a tarmac in Newark for four hours, a planeload of passengers got McDonald's hamburgers and fries by thoughtfulness of the airline. I have experienced the decline of service along with the rest of the flying public. But I believe everything will change little by little, because I remember the days when to fly was to soar  . The airlines, and their employees, took pride in how their passengers were treated. And I think the days are sure to come back one day in the near future. 
 Question:What can be implied from the passage?  _ 
A. The writer lived in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
B. The writer thought the service was not as good as it used to be. 
C. The writer with other passengers waited to be picked up patiently. 
D. Passengers would feel proud of how they were treated on the plane.

Context: My family lives very happily on a farm near a small town. My father always learns some information about weather through the TV, the Internet and newspapers.
One evening, he asked us to meet at the table after dinner. ""I have some bad news,"" he said. ""The weather reports on the television warned that we would face a typhoon tomorrow.""
At 6.30 a.m. the next day, the winds started and the rain was falling heavily. There were new warnings that the sea level could go up as much as 5 meters.
The winds were terribly strong and tree branches were flying everywhere. Trees were falling down and the rain kept coming down.
Just after 10:30, the wind stopped suddenly-it was strangely calm and the sun was shining. Then the winds came howling again, but this time more rain fell. There were more flying things and the storm came in. Everything within 1 km of the coast was flooded-there was fish in the streets. Now the winds were dying down, but the rain was still falling.
After another two hours, the wind came to a stop at last. My home was in a mess and my mum burnt her arm when the hot water from the stove hit her skin. We were all frightened, but we were all safe, including the cat. 
 Question:How long did the typhoon last? 
A. About two hours. 
B. About four hours. 
C. About six hours. 
D. About eight hours. 
 Answer: C
Context: On an August afternoon last year, Pamela Rivers, 40, and her friend Rita Graham, 38, were stopped at a red light on Cobb's Creek Parkway in South Philadelphia when a white SUV traveling in the opposite direction turned across traffic in front of them. It then jumped the curb   and rushed through a grassy expanse   before plunging down an embankment   toward Cobb's Creek. Pamela quickly pulled over, jumped out of her car, and dialed 911.
Kenny Gibson, 23, and his friend Taron Green, 25, were driving home from a job when Rita flagged them down. Kenny stopped, and the men got out of the car and looked over the cliff. The SUV had landed upside down in five feet of water. A woman's leg could be seen swinging out the driver's side window.
""I have a fear of water,"" Kenny said now. ""I almost drowned when I was nine."" Even so, he and Taron hurried down the 50-foot embankment into the muddy water. ""I couldn't just leave her,"" he adds.
The men waded out to the car and saw that the woman, Cheryl Allison, 61, was partially in water. Kenny tried unsuccessfully to open the door. Then he broke the window. But when he reached in to pull out Cheryl, he found she was trapped by the seat belt.
""Run back to the truck and grab a box cutter ,"" Kenny yelled to Taron. Meanwhile, Kenny tried in vain to push the car onto its side to create an air pocket for Cheryl.
That's when mechanic Marcell Porter approached the site. ""I flipped into rescue mode,"" he said. When Taron returned, Kenny cut through the seat belt with the box cutter. He and Marcell tried to pull Cheryl out, but she wouldn't come out.
Marcell broke the rear window with a rock, hoping to rescue her from the back. Then he saw that she was still strapped in by her shoulder belt. Marcell reached for the box cutter and cut the remaining strap in two. Kenny leaned in, grabbed Cheryl by the waist, and pulled her out feet first. Marcell grasped Cheryl's legs, and they managed to drag her lifeless body onto a rock.
""Give her CPR!"" Pamela yelled down to them. But the two men had no idea what to do. ""Put your mouth on her mouth and breathe,"" she shouted to Marcell. And to Kenny, ""Pump her chest!""
""We tried three times,"" said Marcell. Finally, Cheryl brought up water and started moving her fingers. The men rolled her over onto her stomach to let out more water.
Soon an ambulance arrived and transported Cheryl to the hospital, where doctors treated her. They never discovered what caused her to pass out, but she assumes it had something to do with the burning summer heat.
Over the next few days, they took turns visiting Cheryl in the hospital, where they shared hugs and tears. ""We couldn't believe she was all right,"" said Pamela.
""It's just amazing that these people came together,"" said Cheryl. She stays in touch with her ""angels"" via frequent phone calls. ""They are really beautiful people,"" she said.

Context: It was evening rush hour on Pacific Coast Highway in Redondo Beach, CA. Drivers lined up from traffic signal to traffic signal and were anxious to get home. On a side street merging   into this highway was a timid driver who was afraid to edge in and no one let her in. Some of the drivers backed up behind her and loudly blasted their horns. This made her more upset and nervous. 
On the right of this side street, the signal on Pacific Coast Highway turned red and traffic stopped. A driver who saw what was happening to this woman stopped a few car lengths behind her car and motioned to her to pull in front of his car. She quickly did and as he waited, two more cars dashed in behind her car. 
While the woman he'd helped waited for the signal to turn green, she sank into her driver's seat and was deeply relieved. Although this thoughtful man couldn't see it, her body language expressed her gratitude.
If you've been in a traffic situation like the one she was in, you know how upsetting it can be. But this little act of kindness allowed her to safely reach her home. She told others about this, which encouraged them to do something nice for someone else. 
This kindness spreads. Someone does something nice for you and in turn you're likely to do something nice for that person or for someone else. 
A simple act of kindness could have a widespread effect. It's like a stone that drops in a pond and causes ripples in each direction. No one knows how far those ripples will travel but they will affect everything they touch along the way. 
 Question:What can we know about most of the drivers on Pacific Coast Highway from the story? 
A. They were not friendly or thoughtful. 
B. They are thankful to the driver who helped the lady. 
C. They blasted their horns to encourage the lady driver. 
D. They were not anxious to get home. 
 Answer: A
Context: How much empathy do you feel towards other people? If you saw someone fall off their bike in traffic,would you stop and help--or just walk away? Many people would give in to coldness,go about their business and just do nothing.So it was a big surprise when about  100 bystanders got together recently to move a bus in east London to help a cyclist trapped under it.A video of the incident went viral on social media.
According to Zoheb,a driver who stopped his car to take part in the rescue,about five  people gathered to move the bus.He says:""There was no chance we could do it,it was more  an invitation for other people to help,really.""
The initiative paid off.Diners from nearby restaurants joined in.There wasn't much coordination but it didn't take long to develop a collective understanding of what the  objective was.
Spontaneous cooperation among strangers doesn't happen often.People in a  crowd are not sure what to do--they don't have a plan.It's one of the reasons bystanders often do nothing,according to Dr Mark Levine,professor of social psychology at Exeter University in Britain.""The presence of others can prevent you from helping"",he says.
The key to positive group behaviour,Levine explains,""is building a sense of shared identity"".Action has to be decided quickly,Levine says.""The longer you leave it,the harder it is to make a decision.If you don't immediately act then you kind of think'Well,actually I probably couldn't have done anything anyway'.""
But the people who took the initiative like Zoheb might make a difference.The cyclist ended up in hospital and the images of the collective effort might inspire others to more acts of unity. 
 Question:Why do people give in to coldness when they should be helping according to Levine? 
A. They don't know how to give first aid. 
B. Nobody wants to be the first to offer help. 
C. Strangers seldom cooperate with each other. 
D. They are forbidden from helping.

Context: It is well-known that when an individual joins a group, he tends to accept the group's standards of behavior and thinking. Many illustrations could be given of this from everyday life, but what is of particular interest to psychologists is the extent to which people's judgments and opinions can be changed as a result of group pressure, Asch and others noticed that people in a group will agree to statements that are contrary to the evidence of their senses. It would be a mistake to think that only particularly docile people are chosen to take part in experiments of this type. Usually highly intelligent and independent people are used. In a typical experiment, this is what may happen.
   The experimenter asks for volunteers to join a group which is investigating visual perception .The victims are not, therefore, aware of the real purpose of the experiment. Each volunteer is taken to a room where he finds a group of about seven people who are cooperating with the experimenter. The group is shown a standard card which contains a single line. They are then asked to look at a second card. This has three lines on it. One is obviously longer than the line on the first card; one is shorter and one the same length. They have to say which line on the second card is the same length as the line on the standard card. The other members of the group answer first but what the volunteer does not know is that they have been told to pick one of the wrong lines. When his turn comes, he is faced with the unanimous opinion of the rest of the group-all the others have chosen line A but he quite clearly sees line B as correct. What will be do? According to Asch, more than half of the vietims chosen will change their opinion. What is equally surprising is that, when interviewed about their answers, most explained that they knew the group choice was incorrect but that they gave in to the pressure of the group because they thought they must be suffering from an optical illusion , or because they were afraid of being different.

Context: One of the problems career people  have in the morning is dressing for the office when there will be an evening party immediately followed, with no time to return home to change. The easiest solution is to keep a full set of toiletries   and make-ups stored somewhere at the office. A woman going to an evening party should dress in one of her ""basic dresses"" in the morning--the kind that can change into a different look with an added scarf or jewelry. In fifteen minutes, when her office day has ended, she can metamorphose  herself into another person with freshly cleaned teeth, combed hair, a new face, a different and dressier  pair of shoes, and some sparkling jewelry. If she must wear a long dress for the party, she should bring it to the office in a protective bag and store it safely until she has to put it on.

Context: A new product - the Apple Watch - into the market. Last year, the watch was firstly introduced by Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. The price of the watch is from $349 to $1,099, depending on its size and whether it is a sports or regular one.
Apple engineers and designers have put in a lot of thought and hard work into creating this ""small screen"" on your wrist .  The ""sensor "" on the screen not only finds your finger, but also knows the difference between when you are tapping , and when you are pressing hard er.
The watch also has ""haptic feedback "". You can s end personal messages to your friend --such as drawing a star or a special sign with your fingers, or tapping the watch, say 3 times, and your friend will receive those taps on their wrist.
Besides telling the time, the watch will use 'Bluetooth' to connect with your iPhone and show calls or text messages that come in.
According to Tim Cook, the watch may open up a whole new area of applications  that we had never thought of. Some car f actories like BMW have developed an app that allows its car owners to open their cars with the watch. A 'Hotels' app may allow you to open the door to your hotel room without worrying about losing the smart-card. And finally, even at the airport--passengers may be able to simply wave their wrist to check into their flight.
The biggest use of the watch, however, is as your personal fitness coach. The watch can show your pulse (heartbeat) using a sensor at the bottom of the watch. It also has the same sensor as your iPhone, so it knows when you are moving, and also how much you are walking or running. It will remind you if you have been sitting for too long without taking exercise. 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that the Apple Watch  _  . 
A. is designed by Tim Cook 
B. was brought into the market last week 
C. sells at different prices for different colors 
D. can show your pulse and knows when you are moving. 
 Answer: D
Context: (CNN) -- In the last week, the Apple iWatch has made the jump from unlikely rumor to a real product that's probably in development, thanks to reports showing up in various publications.
The clues are planting the seeds of an Apple watch in consumers' minds. The general public has not been crying out for a better watch. And Apple prides itself on knowing what the people want before they do, and an Apple watch would be much more than just a fancy timepiece.
It's not about the watch form factor, but creating a wearable mobile device that takes advantage of advances in mobile computing technology such as cheap sensors, better battery life and improved voice recognition.
If executed correctly, an Apple watch could bring about a profitable industry of products to go with it, like it did with the iOS App Store and mobile applications.
""It's unlimited, the number of wearable things you can put into,"" said Gene Munster, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, who imagines small companies making inexpensive products like belts with sensors that send warnings to the watch when you've eaten too much.
Apple is not entering virgin territory. There are already a handful of fancy smart watches available, but most act as accessories , connecting to the more powerful Android and iOS smartphones and tablets over Bluetooth.
For example, the new Pebble smart watch passes on alerts from a smartphone, so when you receive a text, e-mail, or Facebook notification it is pushed to the watch, which vibrates .
Wearable technology is also booming, thanks to cheap sensors that can be used to track things like movement and heart rates. The number of wearable fitness products has been growing at a fast pace, but an Apple offering would shake up the industry completely.
""We're finally getting some players involved, and Apple is the real one that can add some value to some of this wearable technology,"" said Munster.
Apple isn't alone in seeing the potential for this type of technology. Google is working on its own wearable platform, Google Glasses. The two will compete against each other when they are finally available, each sporting its own unique opinion on what kind of user interface people will use (voice control and a small touchscreen or augmented reality). And they will, of course, have their own ecosystems of accessories and apps.
Traditional watches have dropped in popularity in recent years. Smartphones display the easy-to-see time and are already in our back pockets, so it can seem unnecessary to also tie a small clock to our wrists. But when you start packing more power, sensors and connection options like Bluetooth into a watch, it no longer stays to be a watch and becomes a small wearable computer.
An Apple watch could suddenly become better than the current crop of smart watches by creating a platform, not another accessory. According to Munster, the three tasks people use their smartphones for are, in order, texting, Internet and phone calls. Two out of three of those tasks would be a natural fit for a small device, while the need to surf and play games would ensure the smartphone doesn't become out of date. 
 Question:It's most likely that after the iWatch comes onto the market,   _  . 
A. a great many tablet computers will be off the shelf 
B. many relevant businesses will burst on the scene 
C. belts with sensors will made inexpensive 
D. a traditional wristwatch will be unnecessary

Context: When I was seven, my father gave me a Timex, my first watch. I loved it, wore it for years, and haven't had another one since it stopped ticking a decade ago. Why? Because I don't need one. I have a mobile phone and I'm always near someone with an iPod or something like that. All these
  tell the time -- which is why, if you look around, you'll see lots of empty wrists  ; sales of watches to young adults have been going down since 2007.
But while these wise people have realized that they don't need them, others -- including some distinguished ones of our time -- are spending total fortunes on them. Brands such as Rolex, Patek Philippe and Breitling command shocking prices, up to PS 250.000 for a piece.
This is ridiculous. Expensive cars go faster than cheap cars. Expensive clothes hang better than cheap clothes. But these days, all watches tell the time as well as all other watches. Yes, you may say expensive watches will come with some extra functions -- but who needs them? How often do you dive to 300 metres into the sea to test its function of waterproof, or need to find your direction in the area around the South Pole by using its compass? So why pay that much of five years' school fees for watches that allow you to do these things?
If justice were done, the Swiss watch industry should have closed down when the Japanese discovered how to make accurate watches for a five-pound note. Instead, the Swiss re-invented the watch, with the aid of millions of pounds' worth of advertising, as a message about the man ---- usually a famous star, wearing it. Rolexes are for those who spend their weekends climbing icy mountains; a Patek Philippe is for one from a rich or noble family; a Breitling suggests you like to pilot planes across the world.
Watches are classified as ""investment items""   now. A 1994 Philippe recently sold for nearly PS 350, 000, while 1960s Rolexes have gone from 15, 000 to 30, 000 plus in a year. But, to some wealthy people, a watch is more than an investment. It's a valuable toy for self-satisfaction, a matter of fashion. Prices may keep going up -- they've been rising for fifteen years. But when fashion moves on, the owner of that PS 350, 000 treasured object will suddenly find his pride and joy is no more a good investment than my childhood Times. 
 Question:What can be learnt about Swiss watch industry from the passage? 
A. It targets rich people as its potential customers. 
B. It seems hard for the industry to beat its competitors. 
C. It wastes a huge amount of money in advertising. 
D. It is easy for the industry to re-invent cheap watches.

Context: COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A group of black parents and civil rights activists presented a petition  Thursday calling for officials to drop charges against a 16-year-old South Carolina high school student who was videotaped being dragged from her desk and thrown to the floor by a police officer in her classroom.
The group said it was unfair and unacceptable that the student and her 18-year-old classmate at Spring Valley High School who taped the incident were the only people charged that day when authorities already knew Richland County Deputy Ben Fields had tossed the girl from her desk to the ground.
They also said their petition had hundreds of thousands of names from around the country asking prosecutor Dan Johnson to drop the ""disturbing schools"" charges against the teens. The students in the case are black; Fields is white.
Johnson issued a statement Wednesday saying he won't do anything with the case until the FBI finishes its investigation into Fields, who was fired after the video became public. ""I do not simply decide cases based upon feelings, public opinion or sentiment, nor do I decide them based on political pressure,"" Johnson said in the statement.
Disturbing schools is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or 90 days in jail. The students' lawyer did not respond to telephone messages.
The video spread quickly across the country, prompting questions about when police officers should get involved with classroom discipline. Fields was called to the classroom after the student refused to stop using her cellphone, and then she would not leave the classroom for a teacher or administrator.
In the days after the incident, the teacher turned her class over to a substitute and the administrator was placed on leave. Richland two officials didn't respond to an email asking about their current status. The students were allowed back in school.
Organizers of the protest said they plan to be at South Carolina's Statehouse next year, calling for legislators to change the law that allows police officers to arrest students for misbehaving at schools. Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott blamed that law for escalating the situation. ""Let's find a way where we don't saddle students with arrest records,"" said EfiaNwangaza from the Malcom X Center for Self Determination. ""Let's get ahead of the schoolhouse-to-jailhouse train in South Carolina."" 
 Question:What is Don Johnson's attitude towards the case? 
A. Indifferent 
B. Ambiguous 
C. Subjective 
D. Cautious

Context: Bobbi Kristina Brown's family has been gathered around her since she was hospitalized on Saturday after being found unconscious in the bathtub of her suburban Atlanta townhome.
Whitney Houston's only child is now at Emory University Hospital and is still fighting for her life, as a family statement said on Monday.
Nothing has changed, despite reports that are popping up and painting a more serious picture.
Fox News reported Wednesday that the situation is horrific. ""It's now a matter of when the family wants to let go and accept that she's pretty much not going to make it,"" a source told FOX411. ""They've left it up to the family as to how long they want to keep her alive.""
People Magazine is also reporting that a doctor told Brown's family on Wednesday that nothing more could be done. ""Everyone is coming to the hospital to say goodbye,"" said a family member.
And the Daily Mail says Brown has been taken off life support.
But Bobby Brown issued a statement late Thursday denying these reports.
""If we issued a statement every time the media published a false report regarding this matter, that's all we would be doing 24 hours a day. This is false, just as is the vast majority of the other reporting that is currently taking place,"" he said, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.
A source close to the family tells USA TODAY that it's wrong to say the family is gathering to say goodbye, because the family has been there since the beginning, so nothing is any different today for them.
Also, Brown is ""not brain dead,"" as has been reported.
And, as for other stories saying that the Houston family is feuding with Bobbi Kristina's dad, Bobby Brown? Those aren't true either. They ""are NOT fighting,"" says our source. 
 Question:Which can be the best title of the passage? 
A. An Accident In The Bathtub 
B. Kristina, We're Still Praying And Waiting On A Miracle 
C. False Reports From Different News Media 
D. Bobbi Kristina's Final Days

Context: Americans think a great deal about time. From childhood they learn to value time. As children, they are taught to be on time to go to school, to do work and to do everything. When they are having a good time, they say that time flies. When a person is dying, they say he is living on borrowed time. Time is money. Time is knowledge. Time is everything in America. A working America has to work hard for 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week. This is the working time. In his free time, he also works hard for more money. Even Saturday and Sunday are filled with activities. In the street you can hardly see a man who walks slowly. They walk very fast. In fact, they are running. They love time because time brings them money, comforts and progress. But sometimes they also hate time, for they feel they have become servants of the clock. 
 Question:An American always walks  _  . 
A. sadly 
B. slowly 
C. fast 
D. not very fast 
 Answer: C
Context: My students often tell me that they don't have ""enough time"" to do all their schoolwork.
My reply is often a brief ""You have as much time as the president.""I usually carry on a bit about there being twenty-four hours in the day for everyone, and suggest that ""not enough time"" is not an acceptable explanation of not getting something done.
Once in graduate school,I tried to prove to one of my professors by saying that I was working hard.His answer to me was. ""That's irrelevant .What's important is the quality of your work. "" Since then I have had time to think carefully about the ""hard worker"" dodge ,and I have come to some conclusions--all relevant to the problem of how much time we have.
If you analyze the matter, you can identify two parts of the prob1em:There is, of course,the matter of ""time"", which we call think of as fixed. Then there is the problem of ""work"" during that time. But, as my professor suggested, it's not how hard one works but the quality of the product that's important.
That led me to a new idea: the quality of the work.That concept is perhaps best explained by a sign I once saw on the wall in someone s office: ""Don't work harder. Work smarter."" There is a lot of sense in that idea.
If you can't get more time,and few of US can,the only solution is to improve the quality of the work.That means thinking of ways to get more out of the same time than we might otherwise get.That should lead us to an analysis of our work habits.Since ""work"" for students usually means ""homework"", the expression ""work habits' should be read as ""study habits"".
Then, as a smart student,you will seek to improve those skills that you use in study, chiefly reading and writing. If you learn to read better and write better,there are big advantages that pay off in all your studies. 
 Question:What's the passage mainly about? 
A. Students don't have enough time. 
B. Don't work harder; work smarter. 
C. No one can get more time. 
D. Read better and write better. 
 Answer: B
Context: There is a lot of misunderstanding about studying. Most students have not been taught the principles behind really effective working. Imagine a graph showing the amount a person learns against the number of hours he works in a day. If he doesn't do any work, he learns nothing (point 0). If he does an hour's work he learns a certain amount (point 1). If he does two hours' work he learns about twice as much (point 2). If he does more work he'll learn still more (point 3). However, if he tries to do twenty-three and a half hours' work in a day, he will be so tired that he'll hardly remember anything: what he learns will be very little (point 4). If he did less work he'd learn more (point 5).
Now whatever the exact shape of the graph's curve , made by joining these points, it must have a high point. Point ""X"" is the very maximum anyone can learn in the day. And this represents the optimum , the best, amount of work to do. It is the best possible compromise between adequate time at the books and fatigue . Fatigue is an absolutely real thing; one can't escape it or ignore it. If you try to ignore it and press yourself to work past the optimum, you will only get on this downward slope and achieve less than the best - and then become very tired and lose your power of concentration.
The skill in being a student consists of getting one's daily study as near the optimum point as possible. I cannot tell you what the optimum is. It differs with the type of work, it differs from person to person, and even in the same person it varies from week to week. You must try to find your own. Every day you study, bear this principle of the optimum in mind. When you feel yourself getting fatigued, if you find yourself reading the same paragraph over and over again and not taking it in, that's a pretty good sign you've reached your highest point for the day and should stop. Most ordinary students find their optimum at five hours a day. Yours may be a little more or a little less - but if you get in five hours' good work a day, you will be doing well.
Now, what are you doing with yourself when you aren't working? Before examinations some students do nothing at all except sit in a chair and worry. Here is another misunderstanding. People often think that the mind works like the body; it does not. If one wanted to save one's physical energy in order to cut the maximum amount of firewood, one would lie flat on a bed and rest when one wasn't chopping. But the mind cannot rest. Even in sleep you dream, even if you forget your dreams. The mind is always turning. It gets its relaxation only by variety. That is what makes the mind rest.
When you've finished your optimum number of hours you must stop. You must not then sit around in the chair thinking about the work - that only tires without any learning. You must get out and do something. It doesn't matter what - anything so long as you are actively doing something else but work. 
 Question:The passage tells us that a person's optimum number of working hours   _  . 
A. follows a regular pattern with each individual 
B. changes regularly from week to week 
C. can be partly determined by the sort of work he is doing 
D. should be determined before he gets too tired

Context: Jane was running late. Jane, 25, had a lot to do at work, plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Jane felt weak and tired---maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks.
Several yards away, Tom, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying.
But when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, ""Oh, my God, she fell in!"" Tom didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. ""No! Not you!"" his girlfriend screamed after him.
She was right to be alarmed. By the time Tom reached Jane, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station.
It was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the grins and drag her away from the edge. That was where Jane briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse.
Jane thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in.
Police and fire officials soon arrived, and Tom told the story to an officer. Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40-minute train ride downtown-just as he had been seconds after the rescue, which made her think about her reaction at the time. ""I saw the train coming and I was thinking he was going to die,"" she explained. 
 Question:Why did Jennifer try to stop her boyfriend? 
A. Because they would miss their train. 
B. Because he didn't see the train coming. 
C. Because she was sure Jane was hard to lift. 
D. Because she was afraid the train would kill him. 
 Answer: D

Context: The morning had been a disaster. My tooth was aching,and I'd been in an argument with a friend. Her words still hurt:""The trouble with you is that you won't put yourself in my place. Can't you see things from my point of view?""I shook my head stubbornly-and felt the ache in my tooth. I'd thought I could hold out till my dentist came back from holiday,but the pain was really unbearable. I started calling the dentists in the phone book,but no one could see me immediately. Finally,at about lunchtime,I got lucky.
""If you come by right now,""the receptionist said,""the dentist will fit you in.""
I took my purse and keys and rushed to my car. But suddenly I began to doubt about the dentist. What kind of dentist would be so eager to treat someone at such short notice?Why wasn't he as busy as the others?
In the dentist's office,I sat down and looked around. I saw nothing but the bare walls and I became even more worried. The assistant noticed my nervousness and placed her warm hand over my icecold one.
When I told her my fears,she laughed and said,""Don't worry. The dentist is very good.""
""How long do I have to wait for him?""I asked impatiently.
""Come on,he is coming. Just lie down and relax. And enjoy the artwork,""the assistant said.
""The artwork?""I was puzzled.
The chair went back. Suddenly I smiled. There was a beautiful picture,right where I could enjoy it:on the ceiling. How considerate the dentist was!At that moment,I began to understand what my friend meant by her words.  What a relief!

B. The dentist's being as busy as the other dentists.

Context: The events of Saturday night in Kunming are deeply engraved in the mind of Xie Qiming, who narrowly escaped death in the terrorist attack at the city's railway station.
The 48-year-old policeman intervened to stop the butchering of unarmed civilians, saving many from death and injury, but he was injured in the process.
Lying in a hospital bed, his head and nose marked by serious hacking wounds - one more than 20 centimeters long - Xie recounted  his actions on the day he describes as a nightmare.
""I shot at them but fell to the ground during the fighting. After the shots, the terrorists turned their attention to the police and several of them surrounded me and stabbed me like crazy,"" he said. ""There is no humanity in them.""
Xie is from the Beijinglu Police Station, the closest to the attack, and four police officers from the station were the first to respond. He survived because he was wearing a bulletproof vest, which was damaged by the attackers.
When the officers arrived, the attackers were running out of the ticket hall, attacking people with long knives.
Xie and his colleagues tried to stop the attack, which is when Xie was injured. In addition to the deep cuts, his skull was fractured, and at the time of writing he was awaiting further surgery.
""A wave of fierce anger rose up in my mind, and we all forgot to think about the possible danger to us,"" said Hu Zhe, 23, a police officer trainee at the Beijinglu Police Station.
Having no firearm, he fought the terrorists with a wooden baton, but it got broken in the fighting. He sustained a 6-centimeter wound to his left eyebrow.
Wan Weiqing, a neurosurgeon from Beijing Tiantan Hospital, learned of the attack at 2 am on Sunday and took the first flight to Kunming, where he has been helping the victims.
He said that 71 victims are being treated at the Kunming First People's Hospital, most of them with severe multiple injuries.
""There is one victim whose rib, breastbone, lung and even heart were all injured in one chopping action. The attackers had obviously prepared and practiced for a long time,"" he said.
Zhou Hongmei, director of the Medical Reform Office at the Yunnan Health Department, said a team of medical experts including 29 doctors had arrived in Kunming by Monday night. They have been working at the five hospitals treating victims of the attack.
Chen Min, a Neurology Department nurse at Kunming First People's Hospital, said the department usually had seven nurses in the daytime and three at night. ""But all the other nurses who were not on duty returned to the hospital voluntarily on Saturday night,"" she said.
In the past three days, none of them had more than 10 hours of rest.
""The crucial factor in saving lives in such incidents is treatment without delay,"" said Chai Wenzhao, associate director of the Intensive Care Unit in the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Chai has participated in many emergency rescue efforts.
He said that the victims will need psychological counseling once their physical injuries have been dealt with, because the emotional impact of such an incident can be severe.
Four psychologists from Anding Hospital in Beijing have begun treating some of the victims. 
 Question:How did Xie Qiming survive? 
A. He was saved by his colleagues. 
B. He missed the shot and fell to the ground during the fighting. 
C. He was protected by his bulletproof vest. 
D. He pretended to fall to the ground. 
 Answer: C
Context: Read the following three passages. Each passage is followed by several questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C and D. Choose the one that fits best according to the information given in the passage.
Britons stranded at sea or in flooded homes could find a real-life prince riding to their rescue. Prince William announced on Monday that he is to train to be a full-time pilot with the Royal Air Force's Search and Rescue Force (SARF).
William, who is currently a Lieutenant in the Army's Household Cavalry Regiment , will transfer to the RAF and begin an 18-month training course in January 2009.
If successful, he will become a fully operational Search and Rescue pilot in 2010, flying Sea King helicopters at one of the six SARF units based in Britain.
""The time I spent with the RAF earlier this year made me realize how much I love flying,"" the prince, who spent two weeks with a SARF team while on work experience in 2005, said in a statement.
""Joining Search and Rescue is a perfect opportunity for me to serve in the Forces operationally, while contributing to a vital part of the country's Emergency Services.""
It means he will follow a similar career to that of his uncle, Prince Andrew, who was a Sea King helicopter pilot during the 1982 Falklands war.
The Search and Rescue teams' main duty is to recover RAF personnel but in peacetime they mainly respond to civilian emergencies, dealing with more than 1,000 calls a year.
The units deal with incidents ranging from helping those trapped by sudden major floods to rescuing people lost while out walking on hills.
William, who has spent the last year on secondment to the various branches of the military to prepare for his future role as head of the armed forces, received his RAF wings  following a four-month stint with the service earlier this year.
However, his time with the RAF was clouded when the Defense Ministry was forced to fend off criticism for allowing the prince to fly military helicopters to a bachelor party for his cousin and to the family home of his girlfriend Kate Middleton. 
 Question:It can be inferred from the passage that  _  . 
A. the RAF is an army that rescues its soldiers during wartime 
B. either Andrew or William is interested in flying 
C. there are many floods happening in Britain 
D. the prince saving the people in danger is no longer fairy tale

Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""
It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on. 
 Question:That man called after reading about what Jordan did to a disabled child because he wanted to   _  . 
A. become famous himself 
B. know why Jordan appeared in a poor area 
C. let the author know that Jordan was not that nice 
D. offer another example to show that Jordan was a nice man

 Answer: B
Context: It had been a difficult move. I'd left my family and friends in Indiana, the beloved state where I'd lived most of my life. My new home in Florida was thousands of miles away from anything I knew. It was hot--all the time. Jobs were hard to come by, but I was up for almost any challenge.
At last, I taught in a special school where students have severe learning and behavioral difficulties.
Another teacher and I had spent weeks teaching the children appropriate behavior for public outings. Unexpectedly, only a few students, including Kyle, had not earned the privilege of going. He was determined to make his disappointment known.
In the corridor  between classrooms, he began screaming, cursing, spitting, and swinging at anything within striking distance. Once his outburst died down, he did what he'd done when he was angry at all his other schools, at home, even once at a juvenile detention center. He ran.
People watched in disbelief as Kyle dashed straight into the heavy morning traffic in front of the school.
I heard someone shout, ""Call the police!""
But I ran after him.
Kyle was at least a foot taller than me. And he was fast. His older brothers were track stars at the nearby high school. But I could run long distances without tiring. I would at least be able to keep him in my sight and know he was alive.
After several blocks of running directly into oncoming traffic, Kyle slowed his pace.
He took a sharp left. Standing next to a trash bin, Kyle bent over with his hands on his knees. I must have looked ridiculous. But his was not a look of fear. I saw his body relax. He did not attempt to run again. Kyle stood still and watched me approach. I had no idea what I was going to say or do, but I kept walking closer.
He opened his mouth to speak when a police car pulled up, abruptly filling the space between Kyle and me. The school principal and an officer got out. They spoke calmly to Kyle, who willingly climbed into the back of the vehicle. I couldn't hear what was said, but I didn't take my eyes off Kyle's face, even as they drove away.
I couldn't help but feel that I had failed him, that I should have done or said more, that I should have fixed the situation.
I shared my feelings with a speech therapist who was familiar with Kyle's history. ""No one ever ran after him before, Rachel,"" she said. ""No one. They just let him go.""
Things changed the day he ran and I ran after him, even though I didn't have the right words, even though I wasn't able to save him from the mess he was in. It was the day I didn't throw my hands in the air and decide he was too fast, a waste of time and effort , a lost cause. It was the day my mere presence was enough to make a profound difference. 
 Question:What is the best title of the passage? 
A. Kyle, a Boy with Learning and Behavior Difficulties. 
B. The Teacher Who Ran. 
C. A School with Special Students. 
D. A Terrible Conflict.

Context: I'm telling Mother about a new girl in school,and she suddenly looks up and says,""Who're your two best friends?"" I'm not sure what to say.I've been friends with Jill since I was three or so,and I really like Jaime,a friend in kindergarten.""Well,what about Karen and Cindy?"" She seems upset,like I hurt her feelings.""But they're my sisters."" ""Yes,but they can still be your best friends.Friends may come and go,but your sisters will always be there for you.""
At the time,the idea of my two sisters being my closest friends seemed strange to me.We fought all the time over toys,food and attention.How could my sisters be my best friends?They weren't the same age as I.We all had our own friends in school.But my mother never let the three of us forget it:Sisters are lifelong friends.Her wish was to give us something that she never had.Growing up an only child,she longed for siblings  .When she gave birth to three daughters,the fulfillment of her dream had only just begun.She'd given us each a gift and she wanted to make sure we did not take that gift for granted.She'd frequently tell us how lucky we were.She never showed favoritism to one daughter over the other.And when we were teenagers,Mom always punished us equally.
We didn't always get along beautifully and fought just like any other siblings.But we realized that our mother was right.Today I share things with my sisters that I do with no one else.My sister Cindy and I ran the New York City Marathon together,sidebyside,even holding hands when we crossed the finish line.When my sister Karen got married,I was her maid of honor.The three of us trust each other with our greatest secrets.
It was twentythree years ago that my mother first asked me who my two best friends were.Today she doesn't have to.She already knows. 
 Question:Twentythree years later,who became the author's best friends? 
A. My mother and father. 
B. Jill and Jaime. 
C. My sisters,Jim and Jaime. 
D. Cindy and Karen. 
 Answer: D
Context: Recently, we were given the opportunity to review a book written by a young author. When we received it, I noted how beautifully done it was. While often the case---we see beautifully written and illustrated books all the time---but how often do they come from a 10-year-old? Sewing a Friendship, written by a creative and talented young girl named Natalie Tinti, is such a book.
Developing friendships is an area that Natalie Tinti has researched in her own life. In her book, Sewing a Friendship, she tells what great things can happen if kids take a step toward friendship.
Tinti's characters in Sewing a Friendship have colorful and creative personalities. Jonsy Jipsy loves singing and belly dance. Sokron Blossom lives in a neat and tidy world and loves to read fashion magazines. Meeka likes brain games and Nina is happy with her life and the music it brings her.
All but one of the characters seems happy with their lives. One of the girls, Kiki Shaver, was sad to live in a small home with her aunt and uncle. She had no friend and didn't know how to make them. When four girls invites her into the circle of their friendship, it's no wonder that Kiki is hesitant and uneasy.
The story continues as the four girls invite and accept a "" not so likeable"" girl into their circle to win a fashion show. The girls feel a strong bond of friendship after the show. Kiki then understands that taking a step towards friendship is better than being alone. All the girls learn that by having the courage to include others, you can "" sew a friendship"".
Today, it seems that almost every news headline begins with a child's suicide---or murder---because of being bullied ,not having friends or family to discuss issues with and feelings of low self -respect. What's causing these senseless terrible events? If more kids would invite the outcasts  into their circle of friends, lives would be saved as well as pointed in another direction.
Natalie Tinti finds her voice in Sewing a Friendship ---and shows a talent that's rare for such a young girl. Recommended reading for all young adult fans. 
 Question:The author seems to agree that   _  . 
A. bullying is the main cause of children's suicides 
B. we should not expect too much from friendship 
C. friendship has the power to prevent sad events 
D. one should not forget his old circle of friends

Context: Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver, and the other gold.
This song expresses a nice rule: increasing friends. Sometimes things actually work out that way. I've met adults who've said, ""We've been friends since kindergarten!"" A friend who has known you forever is a treasure. But friendships don't always last -- especially for children.
When I was growing up, my family moved about every three years. The advantage of this was that I got to see different parts of the world, and it made my family very close. I also learned to be pretty good at making new friends, and, to keep in touch with old friends, I became a great letter writer. But I always admired those kids who stayed in one place and kept their friends for a long time. I didn't learn that children's friendships can disappear even when no one moves until I was much older, with children of my own.
Sometimes friendships end in quarrels and hurt feelings. But perhaps the most painful end to a friendship is the one-sided rejection -- one friend turns away, or chooses someone else as a close friend, and the other child is left feeling sad and wondering why this thing happened. The end of a friendship is often sad, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. Often the end of one friendship makes more room for other friendships to grow. 
 Question:When his family moved often, the author couldn't  _  . 
A. make friends easily 
B. become a good letter writer 
C. stay with his friends for a long time 
D. see many different places 
 Answer: C
Context: Wang Ling, a middle school girl, felt angry with her parents after getting a boy's phone call. ""A classmate called me to discuss homework. We talked for just a few minutes before my parents got mad,"" said the girl. ""They asked whether I liked the boy. I'm sad Ididn't, but they wouldn't believe me.""
Wang's trouble is not strange at all because puppy love becomes a big headache for both parents and schools. They worry that puppy love will be bad for their study. Her school makes it a rule not to allow any talk or any _ between one boy and one girl alone.
Many students say they understand why parents and teachers are so nervous about puppy love. But some think they are going too far. ""We have our own thoughts and we know what to do with it."" said Wang Ling.
Another girl, Jiang Ting, liked making friends with boys. ""Boys and girls can learn from each other,"" she said. ""My mother asks me to study hard. However, she never stops me from making friends with boys."" Once Jiang Ting told her mother she might fall in love with a boy. Her mother let Jiang make her own decision. Soon Jiang found that she didn't like him any more because the boy was not as good as what she had thought before. And she did worse and worse in her subjects because she spent much on it. At last she understood the worry from school and most parents about puppy love. 
 Question:What can we learn from the article? 
A. Wang Ling told her mother she might fall in love with a boy. 
B. Jiang's mother doesn't care about her at all. 
C. Puppy love will be bad for student's study. 
D. Puppy love becomes a problem for all students.

Based on the question, the option and the context select the most appropriate answer from the provided choices ""A."", ""B."", ""C."" and ""D."".
Context: There are two types of people in the world. Although they have equal degree of health and wealth and other forts of life, one bees happy and the other bees unhappy. This arises from the different ways in which they consider things, persons, events and the resulting effects upon their minds.
People who are to be happy fix their attention on the convenience of things: the pleasant parts of conversation, the well prepared dishes, the goodness of the wine and the fine weather. They enjoy all the cheerful things. Those who are to be unhappy think and speak only of the opposite things. Therefore, they are continually dissatisfied. By their remarks, they sour the pleasure of society, offend (hurt) many people, and make themselves disagreeable everywhere. If this turn of mind was founded in nature, such unhappy persons would be the more to be pitied. The intention of criticizing  and being disliked is perhaps taken up by imitation . It grows into a habit, unknown to its possessors. The habit may be strong, but it may be cured when those who have it realize its bad effects on their interests and tastes. I hope this little warning may be of service to them, and help them change this habit. 
Although in fact it is chiefly an act of the imagination, it has serious results in life since it brings on deep sorrow and bad luck. Those people offend many others; nobody loves them, and no one treats them with more than the most mon politeness and respect. This frequently puts them in bad temper and draws them into arguments. If they aim at getting some advantages in social position or fortune, nobody wishes them success. Nor will anyone start a step or speak a word to favor their hopes. If they bring on themselves public objections, no one will defend or excuse them, and many will join to criticize their wrongdoings. These should change this bad habit and be pleased with what is pleasing, without worrying needlessly about themselves and others. If they do not, it will be good for others to avoid any contact  with them. Otherwise, it can be disagreeable and sometimes very inconvenient, especially when one bees mixed up in their quarrels. 
 Question:The phrase ""sour the pleasure of society"" most nearly means ""  _  "". 
A. have a good taste with social life 
B. make others unhappy 
C. tend to please others openly 
D. enjoy the pleasure of life 
 Answer: B
Context: Recordings of angry bees are enough to send big, tough African elephants running away, a new study says. Beehives  -either recorded or real-may even prevent elephants from damaging farmer's crops.
In 2002, scientist Lucy King and her team found that elephants avoid certain trees with bees living in them. Today,  Lucy wants to see if African honeybees might discourage elephants from eating crops. But before she asked farmer to go to the trouble of setting up beehives on their farms, she needed to find out if the bees would scare elephants away.
Lucy found a wild beehive inside a tree in northern Kenya and set up a recorder. Then she threw a stone into the beehive, which burst into life. Lucy and her assistant hid in their car until the angry bees had calmed down. Next,Lucy searched out elephant families in Samburu National Reserve in northern Kenya and put a speaker in a close to each family.
From a distance, Lucy switched on the pre-recorded sound of angry bees while at the same time recording the elephants with a video camera. Half the elephant groups left the area within ten seconds. Out of a total of 17 groups, only one group ignored the sound of the angry bees. Lucy reported that all the young elephants immediately ran to their mothers to hide under them. When Lucy Played the sound of a waterfall   instead of the angry bees to many of the same elephant families, the animals were undisturbed. Even after four minutes, most of the groups stayed in one place.
Lucy is now studying whether the elephants will continue to avoid the sound of angry bees after hearing it several times. She hasn't tested enough groups yet to know, but her initial   results were promising enough to begin trials with farmers. She has now begun placing speakers in the fields to see if elephants are frightened away. 
 Question:Why did Lucy throw a stone into a wild beehive? 
A. To record the sound of bees. 
B. To make a video of elephants. 
C. To see if elephants would run away. 
D. To find out more about the behavior of bees. 
 Answer: A
Context: Danger-junkie orangutans  in Borneo climb dead trees and shake then until they begin to fall. They scream with excitement as they cling to the falling tree. Just before the tree hits the ground the orangutans leap to another tree or vine, narrowly escaping death. While no one cab ask orangutans if they enjoy it as a person playing an extreme sport, one animal behaviorist sees this monkey fun as a bit of harmless thrill-seeking.
A growing number of scientists agree that animals are conscious and capable of experiencing basic emotions , such as happiness, sadness, boredom or depression. A few scientists even see the possibility for higher animal emotions like love, jealousy and spite.
Five years ago, behaviorist and animal-rights activist Dr. Jonathan Balcombe stood on a Virginia hotel balcony watching two crows intimately groom   each other in the comfort of an abandoned billboard. He felt that the birds liked what they were doing, even if engaged in a natural, beneficial act, such as picking parasites   off the other's feathers. That moment changed the way he would view animals forever and led to a book, ""Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good"", which is filled with hundreds of examples of animals living it up thanks to developed senses of touch, taste, sight, sound and smell.
Balcombe recounts a favorite example of Kenyan hippos   having high-end spa treatment in a fresh water spring. They splay their toes, open their mouths wide and wait for a school of cleaner fish to remove parasites and slough off dead skin, he recalls. Balcombe knows that the hippos and the fish both benefit from this arrangement. ""My interpretation is that it is also enjoyable for them ,"" he says. 
 Question:We can conclude from the passage that   _  . 
A. only a few animals have emotions 
B. Balcombe's theory is not supported by other scientists 
C. Balcombe has watched a lot of animals showing emotions 
D. Balcombe can understand animal language 
 Answer: C
Context: Envy seems to be bad-but it doesn't have to be. Researchers are finding that, if approached the right way, there can actually be an advantage.
Psychologists classify envy in two ways: negative and positive. With positive envy, you are motivated by another person's success and struggle to follow it. With negative envy, you want to cut the advantaged person down so you look better by comparison. Let's say you feel sufferings of envy after your rival  at another firm gets promoted. Negative envy might drive you to destroy his success, but positive envy would inspire you to work harder and get promoted, too.
Studies show positive envy can be a great motivator . In a 2011 study published in the Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, researchers in the Netherlands conducted a series of experiments with more than 200 university students. Researchers found that when they caused feelings of positive envy----as opposed to admiration or negative envy----in the students, it drove them to want to study more and perform better on a test measuring creativity and intelligence. While admiration may feel better, the researchers found, it doesn't motivate performance like the pain and frustration of envy.
""Those painful sufferings of envy are there for an evolutionary  reason,"" says Texas Christian University researcher Sarah E. Hill, ""warning us that someone has something of importance to us."" Building on this theory, Dr. Hill and others conducted a series of experiments, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, to test whether envy improves attention and memory----the tools needed to copy a rival's steps to success. In one experiment, half of the participants were asked to recall past feelings of envy; the other half weren't. The two groups were then shown mock  interviews of imaginary peers. The group filled with envy paid closer attention and better recalled details about the interview subjects. In other words, envy made them more astute . Not only can envy motivate us to reach for higher goals, it may even give us the cognitive push to get there. 
 Question:What's the benefit of positive envy? 
A. It inspires you to find a possible rival to try to defeat them. 
B. It encourages you to work harder with a positive attitude. 
C. It won't hurt your opponents in the same firm. 
D. It won't destroy your success at another firm.

Context: Perfectionists believe that not only is perfection achievable, but that it should be achieved whenever possible. They always try to make their work better, and often get pleasure from investing time and effort in their projects. They enjoy paying attention to detail and are often hard to please. After all, perfectionists almost always have nearlyimpossible standards for themselves, much higher than what outside parties would generally hope for.
Most perfectionists are also highlyorganized. They've perfected their work process along with everything else in their life. They have processes and patterns for handling almost anything that comes their way, from email to new projects and clients to bookkeeping. It can definitely add up to a more effective workday with less wasted time and effort.
Perfectionists can be thought of as overbearing  by those who don't share their attitude. It can also be upsetting to clients who aren't interested in ""perfect"" and simply want their project done yesterday. When you strive for perfection, everything takes just a bit longer to get right. Even if you have a more efficient design and development process than many other designers, it is likely that you spend more time on each step than a lot of others do.
While most people who call themselves ""perfectionists"" do so in a lighthearted or positive manner, there are those out there to whom perfection becomes an obsession . They consider anything less than perfect completely unacceptable. This can lead to obsessive behavior and can have damaging effects on their overall quality of life. Just feeling good about a job done to the best of your ability is entirely normal for a perfectionists and isn't something to worry about. But it becomes particularly dangerous when perfectionists feel they are never quite able to attain perfection, and so drive themselves crazy trying to always reach this unattainable goal.
These perfectionists often place their entire selfworth on their accomplishments and ability to reach perfection, and since they're never able to reach it, it creates a very negative selfimage and low selfesteem or depression. The good news is that there are trained psychologists who can help those who are nervously obsessed with perfection to overcome their obsession. 
 Question:Clients who are not satisfied with perfectionists think they need   _  . 
A. better coworkers 
B. bigger achievements 
C. higher efficiency 
D. less organization skills

Context: After graduation I returned home to my small town in Indiana. I didn't have a job yet. Mr. Hobbs, a friend of my father's, owned a small shirt factory in town. Within the past five years it had grown from twenty to eighty workers. Mr. Hobbs was worried that his plant was getting too big and inefficient, so he asked me to come in on a short-term basis as a consultant.
I went to the plant and spent about a week looking around and making notes. I was really a mazed at what I saw.
Most curious of all, there was no quality control at all. No one inspected the final product of the factory. As a result some of the shirts that were put in boxes for shipment were missing one or two buttons, the collar, and even a sleeve sometimes!
The working conditions were poor. The tables where the workers sat were very high and uncomfortable. Except for a half hour at lunchtime, there were no breaks in the day to relieve the boring work. There was no music. The walls of the workrooms were a dull gray color. I was amazed that the workers hadn't gone on strike.
Furthermore, the work flow was irregular. There was one especially absent-minded young man in the assembly line who sewed on buttons. After a while I recognized him as ""Big Jim"", who used to sit behind me in math class in high school. He was very slow and all the shifts were held up at his position. Workers beyond him in line on his shift had to wait with nothing to do; therefore, a great deal of time and efficiency were lost as Big Jim daydreamed while he worked. All week I wondered why he wasn't fired.
After I made observations for a week, Mr. Hobbs asked me for an oral report of my findings. 
 Question:The shirts from Mr. Hobbs' factory can be described as   _  . 
A. of low quality 
B. of high quality 
C. fashionable 
D. unfashionable

Context: Soaping up your hands may do more than just get rid of germs. It may wash away the inner confusion you feel right after being forced to make a choice between two appealing choices, according to a new study. The study builds on the past research into a phenomenon known as ""the Macbeth effect""  .
It turns out that Shakespeare was really onto something when he imagined Lady Macbeth trying to clean her conscience by rubbing invisible bloodstains from her hands.
A few years ago, scientists asked people to describe a past wrong act. If people were then given a chance to clean their hands, they later expressed less guilt than people who hadn't cleaned.
This finding interested W. S. Lee, a researcher. ""Anything from the past, any kind of negative emotional experiences, might be washed away,"" says Lee.
He decided to test hand washing's effect on one kind of bad feeling:the tension we feel after being forced to choose between two attractive choices, because picking one choice makes us feel that we've lost the other. People usually try to calm this inner conflict by later exaggerating  the positive aspects of their choice.
He had students rank 10 different music CDs. Then he offered students two of the CDs and told them to select one as a gift. Some students then used liquid soap. Others only looked at the soap or sniffed  it. ""Actually, you do not need water and soap,"" says Lee.
Later, the students again had to rank all the music CDs. People who didn't wash their hands had the normal response -- they scored their take-home CD higher, suggesting that they now saw it as an even more attractive one than before. But this wasn't true for the hand washers. They ranked the music about the same. ""They feel no need at all to justify (...)the choice,"" says Lee.
But the effects of it just aren't clear. Schwarz says it's too soon to know whether people should head for a sink after making a tough choice. He says washing may help decision-makers by cleaning away mental disorder. But perhaps if they don't go through the usual post-decision process of justifying their choice, they might feel more sorrow in the long run. 
 Question:According to Lee, those hand washers consider justifying their choice   _  . 
A. scientific 
B. useful 
C. unnecessary 
D. convincing

Context: When a first-time father saw his newborn son, he immediately noticed the baby's ears obviously standing out from his head. He expressed his concern to the nurse that some children might be made fun of his child. A doctor examined the baby and reassured the new dad that his son was healthy---- the ears presented only a small problem with its appearance.
But the nervous father continued. He wondered if the child might suffer psychological effects of ridicule, or if they should consider plastic surgery . The nurse assured him that it was really no problem, and he should just wait to see if the boy grows into his ears.
The father finally felt more optimistic about his child, but now he worried about his wife's reaction to those large ears. She had been delivered by operation, and had not yet seen the child.
""She doesn't take things as easily as I do,"" he said to the nurse.
By this time, the new mother was settled in the recovery room and ready to meet her new baby. The nurse went along with the dad to lend some support in case this inexperienced mother became upset about her baby's large ears.
The baby was in a blanket  with his head covered for the short trip through the cold air-conditioned corridor. The baby was placed in his mother's arms, who eased the blanket back so that she could look at her child for the first time.
She took one look at her baby's face and looked to her husband and gasped, ""Oh, Honey! Look! He has your ears!""
No problem with Mom. She married those ears...and she loves the man to whom _ are attached.
The poet Kahlil Gibran said, ""Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart."" It's hard to see the ears when you're looking into the light.

Context: The week after Jane's birthday, Barbara and Mary were away. Jane decided to have a late birthday party. She telephoned several friends. She asked some to bring records, some to bring food and others to bring something to drink. She rang another friend to see if she could borrow his record player. She herself bought some food and drink to get the party going. She took up all the carpets   so that they could dance. She did not know whether Barbara and Mary would have approved  , but as long as she was careful, she was sure that they would not mind.

""Someone probably called the police."" When Jane opened the door, there was a policeman standing there. She started to apologize, ""I'm sorry about all the noise, officer. But you see, it was my birthday last week and I'm having a party."" ""Never mind about that, miss. We're here because of something much more important.""

 Answer: D
Context: At Denver there was an crowd of passengers into the coaches  on the eastbound B. & M. express. In one coach there sat a very pretty young woman dressed in elegant taste and surrounded by all the luxurious comforts of an experienced traveler. Among the newcomers were two young men, one of handsome presence with a bold, frank face expression and manner; the other a ruffled, glum-faced person, heavily built and roughly dressed. The two were handcuffed  together.
As they passed down the aisle of the coach the only available seat offered was a reversed one facing the attractive young woman. Here the linked couple seated themselves. The young woman's glance fell upon them with a distant, swift disinterest; then with a lovely smile brightening her face and a tender pink tingeing(,) her rounded cheeks, she held out a little gray-gloved hand. When she spoke her voice, full, sweet, and deliberate, proclaimed that its owner was accustomed to speak and be heard.
""Well, Mr. Easton, if you will make me speak first, I suppose I must. Don't you ever recognize old friends when you meet them in the West?""
The younger man aroused himself sharply at the sound of her voice, seemed to struggle with a slight embarrassment which he threw off instantly, and then clasped her fingers with his left hand.
""It's Miss Fairchild,"" he said, with a smile. ""I'll ask you to excuse the other hand; ""it's otherwise engaged just at present.""
He slightly raised his right hand, bound at the wrist by the shining ""bracelet"" to the left one of his companion. The glad look in the girl's eyes slowly changed to a bewildered horror. The glow faded from her cheeks. Her lips parted in a vague(,), relaxing distress. Easton, with a little laugh, as if amused, was about to speak again when the other forestalled him. The glum-faced man had been watching the girl's face expression with veiled glances from his keen, shrewd eyes.
""You'll excuse me for speaking, miss, but, I see you're acquainted with(,) the officer here. If you'll ask him to speak a word for me when we get to the pen(,) he'll do it, and it'll make things easier for me there. He's taking me to Leavenworth prison. It's seven years for cheating.""
""Oh!"" said the girl, with a deep breath and returning color. ""So that is what you are doing out here? An officer!""
""My dear Miss Fairchild,"" said Easton, calmly, ""I had to do something. Money has a way of taking wings with itself, and you know it takes money to keep step with our crowd in Washington. I saw this opening  in the West,
and
well, an officer isn't quite as high a position as that of ambassador, but--""
""The ambassador,"" said the girl, warmly, ""doesn't call any more. I needn't ever have done so. You ought to know that. And so now you are one of these brave Western heroes, and you ride and shoot and go into all kinds of dangers. That's different from the Washington life. You have been missed from the old crowd.""
The girl's eyes, fascinated, went back, widening a little, to rest upon the glittering handcuffs.
""Don't you worry about them, miss,"" said the other man. ""All officers handcuff themselves to their prisoners to keep them from getting away. Mr. Easton knows his business.""
""Will we see you again soon in Washington?"" asked the girl.
""Not soon, I think,"" said Easton.
.""
""I love the West,"" said the girl irrelevantly. Her eyes were shining softly. She looked away out the car window. She began to speak truly and simply without the gloss of style and manner: ""Mamma and I spent the summer in Denver. She went home a week ago because father was slightly ill. I could live and be happy in the West. I think the air here agrees with me. Money isn't everything. But people always misunderstand things and remain stupid--""
""Say, officer,"" shouted the glum-faced man. ""This isn't quite fair. I'm needing a drink, and haven't had a smoke all day. Haven't you talked long enough? Take me in the smoker now, won't you? I'm half dead for a pipe.""
The bound travelers rose to their feet, Easton with the same slow smile on his face.
""I can't deny a require for tobacco,"" he said, lightly. ""It's the one friend of the unfortunate. Good-bye, Miss Fairchild. Duty calls, you know."" He held out his hand for a farewell.
""It's too bad you are not going East,"" she said, reclothing herself with manner and style. ""But you must go on to Leavenworth, I suppose?""
""Yes,"" said Easton, ""I must go on to Leavenworth.""
The two men sidled down the aisle into the smoker.
The two passengers in a seat near by had heard most of the conversation. Said one of them: ""That officer is a good sort of man. Some of these Western fellows are all right.""
""Pretty young to hold an office like that, isn't he?"" asked the other.
""Young!"" exclaimed the first speaker, ""why--Oh! Didn't you catch on? Say--did you ever know an officer to handcuff a prisoner to his right hand?"" 
 Question:Which of the following can NOT be inferred from the passage? 
A. Miss Fairchild was an ambassador 
B. Easton was an officer with his prisoner 
C. the glum-faced was considerate and careful 
D. Easton had been trying to make a big fortune in the West

Context: There are a lot of things that happen to me in China but would certainly never happen in the US. One of those things is being called ""strong"".
The first time was last December. I was walking across the high school campus in Guangzhou where I taught when a student in a gray scarf waved hello. I smiled and waved back, but then she stopped and called my name. ""You're so strong!"" She smiled and pointed at what appeared to be my arm.
I looked down at my arms. Let's get one thing clear: I'm a very skinny guy. Once, while rehearsing for a high school talent show, I was told by the teacher in charge that I couldn't participate in the men's shirtless dance routine because my visible rig cage  would frighten the audience.
""I'm so what?"" ""You're so strong!"" _ repeated. ""Um, thanks!"" I didn't know what else to say, so we both waved goodbye.
The next morning I stepped into my oral English classroom only to be greeted instantly by a unanimous  ""Waaa!"" of shock and admiration. ""What?"" I asked. ""You're so strong!"" shouted a boy from the back of the class.
""Okay, will someone tell me what that means?"" I was curious as to the real reason for such praise. So I turned to the monitor, gesturing for him to speak.
""We just mean, you look very strong today,"" he offered earnestly.
""What?! You mean like this?"" I curled my arm like a bodybuilder.
""No! But it's so cold, and you're only wearing a shortsleeve shirt.""
Oh, I got it. My ""strength"" had less to do with my muscle and more to do with my apparent ignorance of the cold weather.

D. an American teacher 
 Answer: D
Context: People often use gestures to express our feelings, but the problem is that the gestures can be understood in different ways.
It is true that a smile means the same thing in any language.  So does laughter or crying.  Fear is another emotion  that is shown in much the same way all over the world.  In Chinese and in English literature, a phrase like ""he went pale and began to tremble"" suggests that the man is either very afraid or he has just got a very big shock.
However, ""he opened his eyes wide"" is used to suggest anger in Chinese whereas in English it means surprise. In Chinese, surprise can be described in a phrase like ""they stretched out their tongues!"" ""Stretching out your tongue"" in English is an insulting(, )gesture or expresses strong dislike.
Even in the same culture, people differ in their ability to understand and express feelings.  Experiments in America have shown that women are usually better than men at recognizing fear,  anger,  love and happiness on people's faces. Other studies show that older people usually find it easier to understand body language than younger people do. 
 Question:The best title for this passage can be   _   . 
A. Gestures 
B. Feelings 
C. Culture and Understanding 
D. Gestures and Feelings 
 Answer: D
Context: The triathlon  promises to be one of the most popular Olympic sports.Recently it has drawn huge crowds attracted by athletes swimming 1,500m,cycling 40km,then running 10km without stopping.But what makes an attractive 17yearold girl give up everything for the doubtful pleasure it offers?
Melanie Sears has not yet learnt those oftenrepeated phrases about personal satisfaction,mental challenge and higher targets that most athletes use when asked similar questions.""You swim for 1,500m,then run out of the water and jump on your bike,still wet.Of course,then you freeze.When the 40km cycle ride is over,you have to run 10km,which is a long way when you're feeling exhausted.But it's great fun,and all worth it in the end,"" she says.
Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14 and she won the junior section.Full of confidence,she entered the National Championships,and although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run,she came nowhere.""I was following this man and suddenly we came to the sea.We realised then that we had gone wrong.I ended up cycling 20 kilometres too far.I cried all the way through the running.""
But she did not give up and was determined that she never will.""Sometimes I wish I could stop,because then the pain would be over,but I am afraid that if I let myself stop just once,I would be tempted  to do it again.""Such doggedness draws admiration from Steve Trew,the sport's director of coaching.""I've just been testing her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off and into a wall.She had given it everything,and she just kept on.""
Melanie was top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships,finishing 13th.""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running,but much slower in cycling.That's why I'm working very hard at it."" She is trying to talk her longsuffering parents,who will carry the PS1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's world championships,into buying a PS2,000 bike,so she can try 25km and 100km races later this year.
But there is another price to pay.""I don't have a social life,""she says.""After two hours' hard swimming on Friday night,I just want to go to sleep.But I phone and write to the other girls in the team."" What does she talk about?Boys?Clothes?""No,what sort of times they are achieving."" 
 Question:What upset Melanie during the National Championships? 
A. She was tricked by another competitor. 
B. She felt she had let her teammates down. 
C. She made a mistake during part of the race. 
D. She realized she couldn't cycle as fast as she thought. 
 Answer: C
Context: When I was growing up, I was embarrassed to be seen with my father. He was badly crippled  , and when we would walk together, his hand on my arm for balance, people would stare, I would be ashamed of the unwanted attention. If ever noticed or bothered, he never let on.
It was difficult to walk together--and because of that, we didn't say much as we went along. But as we started out, he always said, ""You set the pace. I will try to follow you.""
Our usual walk was to or from the subway, which was how he got to work. He went to work sick, and even in bad weather. He almost never missed a day, and would make it to the office even if others could not. It was a matter of pride for him.
When snow or ice was on the ground, it was impossible for him to walk, even with help... Such times my sister or I would pull him through the streets of Brooklyn, N.Y., on a child's sleigh to the subway entrance. Once there, he would try to grasp handrail until he reached the lower steps that the warmer tunnel air kept ice free. In Manhattan the subway station was the basement of his office building, and he would not have to go outside again until we met him in Brooklyn on his way home. w.w.w.k.s.5.u.c.o.m
When I think of it now, I am surprised at how much courage it must have taken for a grown man to suffer from shame and disability. And I am also surprised at how he did it--without bitterness or complaint.
He never talked about himself as an object of pity, not did he show any envy of the more fortunate or able. What he looked for in others was a ""good heart"", and if he found one, the owner was good enough for him.
Now that I am older, I believe that is a proper standard by which to judge people, even though I still don't know exactly what a ""good heart"" is. But I know the times I don't have one myself.
He has been away for many years now, but I think of him often. I wonder if he sensed my reluctance to be seen with him during our walks. If he did, I am sorry I never told him how sorry I was, how unworthy I was, how I regretted it. I think of him when I complain about my troubles, when I am envious of another's good fortune, when I don't have a ""good heart"". 
 Question:How did the father get to work usually? 
A. By subway. 
B. By bus. 
C. By wheelchair. 
D. By bike

Context: I'm not so sure I like my friends any more. I used to like them-to be honest. We'd have lunch, talk on the phone or exchange emails, and they all seemed normal enough. But then came Face Book, and I was introduced to a sad fact: many of my friends have dark sides that they had kept from me.
Today my friends show off the more unpleasant aspects of their personalities via FaceBook. No longer hidden, they're thrown in my face like TV commercials -unavoidable and endless advertisements for the worst of their personalities.
Take Fred. If you were to have lunch with him, you'd find him warm, and self-effacing .Read his FaceBook and you'll realize he's an unbearable, food-obsessed boring man. He'd pause to have a cup of coffee on his way to save a drowning man-and then write about it.
Take Andy. You won't find a smarter CEO anywhere, but now he's a CEO without a company to run. So he plays Mafia Wars on FaceBook. He's doing well-level 731. Thanks to FaceBook, I know he's playing about 18 hours a day. Andy, you've run four companies-and this is how you spend your downtime? What happned to golf?What happened to getting another job?
Take Liz. She is positive that the flu vaccine will kill us all and that we should avoid it. And then comes Chris who likes to post at least 20 times a day on every website he can find, so I get to read his thoughts twice, once on FaceBook and once on Twitter.
In real life, I don't see these sides of people. Face to face, my friends show me their best. They're nice, smart people. But face to FaceBook, my friends is like a blind date which goes horribly wrong.
I'm left with a dilemma. Who is my real friend?Is it the Liz I have lunch with or the anti-vaccine madman on FaceBook? Is it the Fred I can grab a sandwich with or the Fred who weeps if he's at a party and the wine isn't up to his standard?

Context: Are you in a bad mood? Don't worry! According to a new Australian study, a bad mood can actually be good for you. The study showed that being sad could help people to judge others more correctly and was also good for the memory.
The study was carried out by Professor Joseph Forgas at the University of New South Wales.""People in a bad mood paid more attention to the people and things around them than happy people .Happy people were more likely to believe anything they were told,""said Forgas
For the study, Forgas and his team did a lot of experiments. During the experiments, they made the participants  feel happy or sad by watching films and thinking about good or bad things of the past.
In one of the experiments, happy and sad participants were asked to judge whether some wrong things were true or not. The results showed that people in a bad mood were less likely to believe that these things were true.
People in a bad mood were also less likely to make mistakes when they were asked to remember the things that they saw.
The study also showed that sad people were better at talking about their thoughts in written style. In fact, the study said that a slightly bad mood could help to make communication more successful. 
 Question:Being sad is good for the following except   _  . 
A. one's judgment 
B. one's diet 
C. one's memory 
D. one's communication

Context: You probably remember me from the other day. I was the one who reacted very slowly to the green traffic light. When you honked your horn ,I realized I was holding up traffic, so please accept my apology. However, I do want you to know why I seemed in a confused state. You see, I was just at the doctor's office getting the results of the examination I had two weeks ago, and I was wondering how I would tell my husband and children that I had cancer. There were still tears in my eyes, so,quite simply I didn't even see the lights change. Perhaps I should not have been driving, but I didn't want to miss my appointment.
I was in the express lane at the supermarket without thinking and moving. Please accept my apology. My mind was on my youngest daughter who ran away from home, and she?'just sixteen. I was so worried then. You see, she somehow got in with the wrong crowd and started using drugs and drinking. I was remembering what a pretty little girl she had been most of her life. I know you were unhappy along with others in line. Please, accept my apology.
I remember you from the store last week. I was so mean to you, when you were doing your job to the best of your ability. I acted so childishly. Please accept my apology. You see, I arrived home from work just yesterday and discovered that my wife had left me, but I should never have taken it out on you. Please, accept my apology.
The above are imagined incidents, and yet they expressed a very real truth. The old saying about judging others before you ""have walked a mile in their shoes"" is a much needed reminder. Perhaps we all could try to learn the fact that there are problems and situation in the lives of others which we are totally unaware of. So, maybe before we get angry in similar situations, we should think a moment and understand that things may be going on in other's lives which have caused them to be slower, absent-minded or angry. Patience, as they say, is a virtue. 
 Question:What does the author mainly want to express? 
A. Learn to accept others?apology. 
B. We need more patience and understanding. 
C. Be patient when you are in line. 
D. The patient should not drive to the office. 
 Answer: B
Context: After I made it to the city center, I started to feel it might be easy for a foreigner to deal with the great size of Beijing. With growing confidence, I decided to take the subway to the hotel, not realizing that the network didn't go that far. Impressed with the cleanliness of the station, I bought a ticket and boarded the first train that came along.
After a few minutes I asked in English of course a young man seated next to me where I should get off closest to the Friendship Hotel. Wearing a smart business suit and tie, he would surely speak English, wouldn't he? Unfortunately, he couldn't understand me but seemed very friendly. I showed him the room card with all the information of the Friendship Hotel in Chinese characters. He looked at it, and then his eyes moved quickly to the carriage   subway map. Next, he raised three fingers of his right hand.
In Australia, raising fingers at someone is not usually nice, but this man wasn't smiling. At the next station he showed me two fingers. Now in   Australia, that's really rude, but I got the message. When we stopped at the third station, he didn't just point to the door, but got up, took me out of the train, and led me to the top of the stairs, and out onto the street. Then he stopped a taxi and told the driver where to take me.
All this came from a man who couldn't speak my language, and I couldn't speak his. I was now speechless, especially when he refused my offer of money. I felt a little embarrassed having even thought he would accept a tip.
This experience made it clear I had to learn some Chinese quickly or my adventures might start turning into bad luck. 
 Question:The author's purpose of writing this passage is mainly to   _  . 
A. prove the importance of being careful 
B. appreciate the kindness of the young man 
C. complain some cultural misunderstanding

Context: One day, Mary asked her mother, ""Mum, what do people mean by saying they have a skeleton in the closet ?"" Her mother paused thoughtfully and said, ""Well, it's something that you would rather not have anyone else know about. For example, if in the past, someone in Dad's family had been arrested for stealing a horse, it would be a skeleton in his family's closet. He really wouldn't want any neighbor to know about it.""
""Why pick my family?"" Mary's father said with anger. ""Your family history isn't so good, you know. Wasn't your great-great-grandfather a prisoner who was transported to Australia for his crimes?""  ""Yes, but people these days say that you are not a real Australian unless your ancestors arrived as prisoners."" ""Gosh, sorry I asked. I think I understand now."" Mary cut in before things grew worse.
After dinner, the house was quiet. Mary's parents were quite angry with each other. Her mother was ironing clothes and every now and then she glared at her husband, who hid behind his newspaper pretending to read. When she finished, she gathered the freshly pressed clothes in her arms and walked to Mary's closet. Just as she opened the door and reached in to hang a skirt, a bony arm stuck out from the dark depths and a bundle of white bones fell to the floor. Mary's mother sank into a faint , waking only when Mary put a cold, wet cloth on her forehead. She looked up to see the worried faces of her husband and daughter.
""What happened? Where am I?"" she asked. ""You just destroyed the school's skeleton, Mum,"" explained Mary. ""I brought it home to help me with my health project. I meant to tell you, but it seemed that as soon as I mentioned skeletons and closets, it caused a problem between you and Dad."" Mary looked in amazement as her parents began to laugh madly. ""They're crazy,"" she thought. Ks5u 
 Question:According to Mary's mother, ""a skeleton in a closet"" means   _  . 
A. a family honor

Context: It was evening rush hour on Pacific Coast Highway in Redondo Beach, CA. Drivers lined up from traffic signal to traffic signal and were anxious to get home. On a side street merging   into this highway was a timid driver who was afraid to edge in and no one let her in. Some of the drivers backed up behind her and loudly blasted their horns. This made her more upset and nervous. 
On the right of this side street, the signal on Pacific Coast Highway turned red and traffic stopped. A driver who saw what was happening to this woman stopped a few car lengths behind her car and motioned to her to pull in front of his car. She quickly did and as he waited, two more cars dashed in behind her car. 
While the woman he'd helped waited for the signal to turn green, she sank into her driver's seat and was deeply relieved. Although this thoughtful man couldn't see it, her body language expressed her gratitude.
If you've been in a traffic situation like the one she was in, you know how upsetting it can be. But this little act of kindness allowed her to safely reach her home. She told others about this, which encouraged them to do something nice for someone else. 
This kindness spreads. Someone does something nice for you and in turn you're likely to do something nice for that person or for someone else. 
A simple act of kindness could have a widespread effect. It's like a stone that drops in a pond and causes ripples in each direction. No one knows how far those ripples will travel but they will affect everything they touch along the way. 
 Question:What can we know about most of the drivers on Pacific Coast Highway from the story? 
A. They were not friendly or thoughtful. 
B. They are thankful to the driver who helped the lady. 
C. They blasted their horns to encourage the lady driver. 
D. They were not anxious to get home.

Context: At 10 years old, Flynn Mc Garry became sick of the meals his mother cooked for him. So the Los Angeles native took matters into his own hands and started making his own dinners. One of his specialties? Trout with braised leeks .
Now 13, the young chef is being praised as a ""food prodigy "". He will spend his summer apprenticing with some of the best chefs at LA's famous restaurants, MSNBC Nightly New reports.
Mc Garry began making a name for himself in the culinary  world when John Sedlar, owner of the trendy Playa Restaurant, let Mc Garry take over the kitchen for a special nine-course meal. The meal sold out almost instantly.
""Flynn is a very unusual young man, and he's very, very passionate,"" owner John Sedlar told MSNBC.
By usual teenage boy standards, it's true. So strong is his passion for cooking that the young man has turned his bedroom into an experimental kitchen laboratory.
Instead of video game consoles, baseball trophies and movie posters, Mc Garry's room is lined with mixers, pots and pans, cutting boards and a stainless steel worktable. It's where Mc Garry cooks his monthly pop-up dinners, which are served from his family's dining room, a monthly supper club he calls Eureka.
Mc Garry is deft  and confident in the kitchen, with skills he's been practicing since he was a child. What started out as a means of self-preservation from his mom's unsatisfactory cooking has turned into a passion that the teen hopes to develop into a career.
""My goal? Michelin three stars, a restaurant in the top 50 list,"" he told MSNBC. ""Hopefully the top five."" Meanwhile, Mc Garry's 13-year-old resume is already richer and more impressive than most cooks many times his age.
Mc Garry isn't the only talented young prodigy to surprise experts in his field in recent years. At just 17 years old, physicist Taylor Wilson is already teaching graduate-level courses in physics and has built a functioning nuclear reactor. 
 Question:Compared with many adult chefs, Mc Garry   _  . 
A. has the best cooking equipment in his kitchen 
B. is inventive and has many new specialties to his name 
C. has much and impressive cooking experience for his young age 
D. wants to open his own Michelin three-star restaurant

Context: I was 18 when Tim and I began to date. Shy and quiet, I'd met his parents once before but hadn't ventured to say more than "" Hello"". This particular evening, however, we were taking them out to dinner for their anniversary and I wanted to make a good impression.
Tim and his parents arrived and I was out the door in a flash. My good impression began with "" punctual"". I sat in the backseat beside Tim nervously watching his father's eyes glance into the rearview mirror to examine me.
Tim and his parents had already decided on their favorite Mexican restaurant and that was fine with me; the dim lighting would hide the rising flush of my cheeks, and if anyone noticed, I could blame it on the peppers. With proper table manners I managed to survive halfway through dinner without making any unforgivable mistakes. However, in the midst of conversation I reached for my iced tea, raised the glass to my lips and very quickly discovered I had picked up the wrong glass.
I quickly lowered the glass and set it back but it was too late; I had burnt my eyebrows, the hair in my nose, and curl over my forehead! I looked up slowly, praying no one had seen me, but all eyes at the table had seen and each face stared at me in shocked silence. Excusing myself, I ran to the restroom.
I would have hidden there forever but I'd barely gotten in the door when Tim's mother arrived. "" Ah, honey,"" she said, holding out her arms to me. "" Everything will be just fine.""
Tim and I eventually married. We had a small ceremony and a family reception afterwards held at the very restaurant where this incident occurred. This time, however, I didn't drink any candles... only a Margarita ; they were served in different glasses. 
 Question:It can be inferred from the passage that  _  . 
A. the author had never met her parents-in-law before dinning together 
B. Tim and the author took the bus to get to the restaurant 
C. Tim's father was curious to know about the author 
D. Tim's mother was not satisfied with the author's behavior 
 Answer: C
Context: Much meaning can be conveyed, clearly, with our eyes, so it is often said that eyes can speak.
Do you have such kind of experience? In a bus you may look at a stranger, but not too long. And if he is sensing that he is being stared at, he may feel uncomfortable.
The same is in daily life. If you are looked at for more than necessary, you will look at yourself up and down to see if there is anything wrong with you. If nothing goes wrong, you will feel angry toward other's stare at you that way. Eyes do speak, right?
Looking too long at someone may seem to be rude and aggressive. But things are different when it comes to stare at the opposite sex. If a man glances at a woman for more than 10 seconds and refuses to avert his gaze, his intentions are obvious. That is, he wishes to attract her attention, to make her understand that he is admiring her.
However, the normal eye contact for two people engaged in conversation is that the speaker will only look at the listener from time to time; in order to make sure that the listener does pay attention to hat the former is speaking, to tell him that he is attentive.
If a speaker looks at you continuously when speaking, as if he tries to dominate you, you will feel disconcerted. A poor liar usually expose s himself by looking too long at the victim, since he believes the false ides that to look straight in the eye is a sign of honest communication.
In fact, continuous eye contact is confined to lovers only, who will enjoy looking at each other tenderly for a long time, to show affection that words cannot express.
Evidently, eye contact should be done according to the relationship between two people and specific situation. 
 Question:How can we tell if someone possibly lying? 
A. If he looks at you directly in the eye for too long. 
B. If he looks at you occasionally. 
C. If he looks honest. 
D. If he looks attentive. 
 Answer: A

The doctor, Mr Lee, was standing by his bed, looking at him worriedly. When he saw Sam awake, he asked, ""How are you feeling, Sam?"" Sam smiled and said, ""Not bad, Doctor. Thank you very much for doing the special operation ."" Mr Lee was moved by Sam. When he was leaving, Sam said, ""Please don't tell Jason about it."" ""Well...Well...OK,"" Mr Lee replied.
Months later when Jason's wounds healed , Sam was still very sick. He couldn't see or walk. He could do nothing but stay in his wheelchair all day long.

So I gave my eyes to you so that you can enjoy life as a healthy man. Now you have new friends. I'm glad to see that you are as healthy and happy as usual. I'm glad you live a happy life.

Context: One evening after dinner, Mr. and Mrs. Tisich called a family meeting. ""We've had to make a difficult decision,"" Mr. Tisich announced. ""You see, your mother has been offered a post as co-director of a television station in Chicago. Unfortunately, the station is not here. After thinking long and hard about it, we've concluded that the right decision is to move to Chicago."" Marc looked shocked, while his sister Rachel breathlessly started asking when they'd be moving. ""It's surprising, but exciting!"" she said. Marc simply said, ""We can't go--I can't leave all my friends. I'd rather stay here and live with Tommy Lyons!""
The Tisichs hoped that by the time they moved in August, Marc would grow more used to the idea of leaving. However, he showed no signs of accepting the news, refusing to pack his belongings. When the morning of the move arrived, Marc was nowhere to be found. His parents called Tommy Lyon's house, but Mrs. Lyons said she hadn't seen Marc. Mrs. Tisich became increasingly concerned, while her husband felt angry with their son for behaving so irresponsibly.
What they didn't know was that Marc had started walking over to Tommy's house, with a faint idea of hiding in Lyons's attic  for a few days. But something happened on the way as Marc walked past all the familiar landscape of the neighborhood: the fence that he and his mother painted, the tree that he and his sister used to climb, the park where he and his father often took evening walks together. How much would these mean without his family, who make them special in the first place? Marc didn't take the time to answer that question but instead hurried back to his house, wondering if there were any moving cartons the right size to hold his record collection. 
 Question:The reason for Marc's going home was that  _  . 
A. he did not want to be left behind 
B. he realized his family was important to him 
C. he hoped to reach an agreement with his parents 
D. he wished to be a more responsible person

Context: I'm not so sure I like my friends any more. I used to like them-to be honest. We'd have lunch, talk on the phone or exchange emails, and they all seemed normal enough. But then came Face Book, and I was introduced to a sad fact: many of my friends have dark sides that they had kept from me.
Today my friends show off the more unpleasant aspects of their personalities via FaceBook. No longer hidden, they're thrown in my face like TV commercials -unavoidable and endless advertisements for the worst of their personalities.
Take Fred. If you were to have lunch with him, you'd find him warm, and self-effacing .Read his FaceBook and you'll realize he's an unbearable, food-obsessed boring man. He'd pause to have a cup of coffee on his way to save a drowning man-and then write about it.
Take Andy. You won't find a smarter CEO anywhere, but now he's a CEO without a company to run. So he plays Mafia Wars on FaceBook. He's doing well-level 731. Thanks to FaceBook, I know he's playing about 18 hours a day. Andy, you've run four companies-and this is how you spend your downtime? What happned to golf?What happened to getting another job?
Take Liz. She is positive that the flu vaccine will kill us all and that we should avoid it. And then comes Chris who likes to post at least 20 times a day on every website he can find, so I get to read his thoughts twice, once on FaceBook and once on Twitter.
In real life, I don't see these sides of people. Face to face, my friends show me their best. They're nice, smart people. But face to FaceBook, my friends is like a blind date which goes horribly wrong.
I'm left with a dilemma. Who is my real friend?Is it the Liz I have lunch with or the anti-vaccine madman on FaceBook? Is it the Fred I can grab a sandwich with or the Fred who weeps if he's at a party and the wine isn't up to his standard? 
 Question:According to the text, FaceBook tends to   _  . 
A. present another side of people 
B. offer some foods for free 
C. show endless advertisements 
D. get you to more parties 
 Answer: A

Context: Father was a hardworking man who delivered bread as a living to support his wife and three children. He spent all his evenings after work attending classes, hoping to improve himself so that he could one day find a better paid job. Except for Sundays, Father hardly ate a meal together with his family. He worked and studied very hard because he wanted to provide his family with the best that money could buy. 
   Whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else. 
   The day came when the examination results were announced. To his joy, Father passed, and with distinctions too! Soon after, he was offered a good job as a senior supervisor which paid handsomely.
   Like a dream come true, Father could now afford to provide his family with life's little luxuries like nice clothing, fine food and vacation abroad.
   However, the family still did not get to see Father for most of the week. He continued to work very hard, hoping to be promoted to the position of manager. In fact, to make himself a worthily candidate for the promotion, he took another course in an open university.
   Again, whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else.
   Father's hard work paid off and he was promoted. Happily, he decided to hire a maid to relieve his wife from her domestic tasks. He also felt that their three-room flat was no longer big enough. It would be nice for his family to be able to enjoy the facilities and comfort of a condominium.    Having experienced the rewards of his hard work many times before, Father resolved to further his studies and work at being promoted again. The family still did not get to see much of him. In fact, sometimes Father had to work on Sundays entertaining clients.
   Over again, whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else.
   As expected, Father's hard work paid off again and he bought a beautiful condominium overlooking the coast of Singapore. On the first Sunday evening at their new home, Father declared to his family that he decided not to take any more courses or pursue any more promotions. From then on he was going to devote more time to his family, and it was a promise. 
   Father did not wake up the next day. 
 Question:Father worked and studied very hard because   _  . 
A. he had to support his family 
B. he wanted to bring his family a better life 
C. he was enthusiastic in attending classes 
D. he had to so as to reduce his family's complaint

Context: The day my husband fell to his death,it started to snow,just like any November day.His body,when I found it,was lightly covered with snow.It snowed almost every day for the next four months,while I sat on the couch and watched it pile up.One morning,I _ downstairs and was surprised to see a snow remover clearing my driveway and the bent back of a woman shoveling my walk.I dropped to my knees,crawled through the living room.And back up stairs so those good people would not see me.I was embarrassed.My first thought was,how would I ever repay them? I didn't have the strength to brush my hair let alone shovel someone's walk.
Before John's death,I took pride in the fact that I rarely asked for help or favors,I defined myself by my competence and independence.So who was I if I was no longer capable and busy? How could I respect myself if all I did was sit on the couch every day and watch the snowfall?
Learning how to receive the love and support that came my way wasn't easy.Friends cooked forme and l cried because I couldn't even help them set the table.""I'm not usually this lazy,""I wept.Finally,my friend Kathy sat down with me and said,""Mary,cooking for you is not a burden. I love you and I want to do it.It makes me feel good to be able to do something for you.""
Over and over,I heard similar emotions from the people who supported me during those dark days.One very wise man told me,""You are not doing nothing.Being fully open to your sorrow may be the hardest work you will everdo.""
I am not the person I once was,but in many ways I have changed for the better.My heart is now filled with thanks for people around me.I have been surprised to learn that there is incredible freedom that comes from facing one's worst fear and walking away whole.I believe there is strength,for sure,in accepting a dark period of our life. 
 Question:We can infer from the passage that   _  . 
A. the writer found her husband immediately he fell off the roof

Before John's death,I took pride in the fact that I rarely asked for help or favors,I defined myself by my competence and independence.So who was I if I was no longer capable and busy? How could I respect myself if all I did was sit on the couch every day and watch the snowfall?
Learning how to receive the love and support that came my way wasn't easy.Friends cooked forme and l cried because I couldn't even help them set the table.""I'm not usually this lazy,""I wept.Finally,my friend Kathy sat down with me and said,""Mary,cooking for you is not a burden. I love you and I want to do it.It makes me feel good to be able to do something for you.""
Over and over,I heard similar emotions from the people who supported me during those dark days.One very wise man told me,""You are not doing nothing.Being fully open to your sorrow may be the hardest work you will everdo.""
I am not the person I once was,but in many ways I have changed for the better.My heart is now filled with thanks for people around me.I have been surprised to learn that there is incredible freedom that comes from facing one's worst fear and walking away whole.I believe there is strength,for sure,in accepting a dark period of our life. 
 Question:Which of the following is true according to the passage? 
A. The writer's friend was unwilling to cook for her. 
B. The writer had been busy with her life before. 
C. The writer recovered from her sorrow quickly with his friend's help. 
D. The day her husband died,it was snowing heavily.

Context: FFather was a hardworking man who delivered bread as a living to support his wife and three children. He spent all his evenings after work attending classes,hoping to improve himself so that he could one day find a better. paid job. Except. for Sundays, Father hardly ate a meal together with his family. He worked and studied very hard because he wanted to provide his family with the best that money could buy.
Whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else. 
The day came when the examination results were announced. To his joy, Father passed, and with distinctions too! Soon after, he was offered a good job as a senior supervisor which paid handsomely.
Like a dream come true, Father could now afford to provide his family with life's little luxuries like nice clothing,fine food and vacation abroad.
However, the family still did not get to see Father for most of the week. He continued to work very hard, hoping to be promoted to the position of manager. In fact, to make himself a worthily candidate for the promotion, he took another course in an open university.
Again, whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else.
Father's hard work paid off and he was promoted. Happily, he decided to hire a maid to relieve his wife from her domestic tasks. He also felt that their three-room flat was no longer big enough. It would be nice for his family to be able to enjoy the facilities and comfort of a condominium.  Having experienced the rewards of his hard work many times before, Father resolved to further his studies and work at being promoted again. The family still did not get to see much of him. In fact, sometimes Father had to work on Sundays entertaining clients.
 Over again, whenever the family complained that he was not spending enough time with them, he reasoned that he was doing all this for them. Though he often longed to spend more time with his family, he weighed his contribution to his family above everything else.
As expected, Father's hard work paid off again and he bought a beautiful condominium overlooking the coast of Singapore. On the first Sunday evening at their new home, Father declared to his family that he decided not to take any more courses or pursue any more promotions. From then on he was going to devote more time to
his family, and it was a promise.
Father did not wake up the next day.

Context: Ellen and Bill County are both teachers. They met in college and became good friends because of their shared love for children. Two years after the couple got married, Ellen saw a huge change in the life of one of her students, a 9 - year - old girl. Three years earlier both of the little girl's parents had died and there was no one to take care of her. She was taken away to live in a government office. But finally she was taken in and adopted by a family and became their daughter. Ellen said that she noticed the difference in the child's life after she was placed in a permanent home and thought that maybe she and her husband could help a child in a similar way.
They decided to become temporary parents and to take a child into their home just on the weekends when the real parents could not take care of him or her. The pair planned to have their own children in a few years, but decided that this would be a way to give to the community in the meantime.
The couple quickly grew to love one of the children they looked after. When he became legally available, Billy became the first child they took in permanently. Six months after adopting Billy, Ellen was told by her doctor that she was unable to have children naturally. Ellen says she knew then that adoption was the way she was meant to have a family.
Since adopting Billy, now 17, Ellen and Bill have adopted five more children -- Rose, 16; Albert, 11; Joshua, 5 and in June 2003, they added biological brother and sister Tyler and Rylee to the County family. The County family has been recognized for their work on adoption, and has received many awards for their efforts.  Last June,  the family was even interviewed on  the television show, ""Adoption Stories"".
Ellen says she would like to encourage other families to adopt children. She adds that the best part of being a mother of six is: ""Giving Josh a bath, putting a band-aid on a cut knee or just the everyday Mom things, that makes motherhood such an honor and a privilege."" 
 Question:Why did Ellen and Bill first decide to adopt a child? 
A. Because they had always loved students very much. 
B. Because they saw the benefits of adoption for a child. 
C. Because they were not able to have children of their own. 
D. Because they want to receive awards for their community work.

Context: Bobbi Kristina Brown's family has been gathered around her since she was hospitalized on Saturday after being found unconscious in the bathtub of her suburban Atlanta townhome.
Whitney Houston's only child is now at Emory University Hospital and is still fighting for her life, as a family statement said on Monday.
Nothing has changed, despite reports that are popping up and painting a more serious picture.
Fox News reported Wednesday that the situation is horrific. ""It's now a matter of when the family wants to let go and accept that she's pretty much not going to make it,"" a source told FOX411. ""They've left it up to the family as to how long they want to keep her alive.""
People Magazine is also reporting that a doctor told Brown's family on Wednesday that nothing more could be done. ""Everyone is coming to the hospital to say goodbye,"" said a family member.
And the Daily Mail says Brown has been taken off life support.
But Bobby Brown issued a statement late Thursday denying these reports.
""If we issued a statement every time the media published a false report regarding this matter, that's all we would be doing 24 hours a day. This is false, just as is the vast majority of the other reporting that is currently taking place,"" he said, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.
A source close to the family tells USA TODAY that it's wrong to say the family is gathering to say goodbye, because the family has been there since the beginning, so nothing is any different today for them.
Also, Brown is ""not brain dead,"" as has been reported.
And, as for other stories saying that the Houston family is feuding with Bobbi Kristina's dad, Bobby Brown? Those aren't true either. They ""are NOT fighting,"" says our source. 
 Question:Which can be the best title of the passage? 
A. An Accident In The Bathtub 
B. Kristina, We're Still Praying And Waiting On A Miracle 
C. False Reports From Different News Media 
D. Bobbi Kristina's Final Days

Tracy took photos of the dog and printed off 400 FOUND fliers , and put them in mailboxes.

His four-year-old son had breakfast with Mickey Mouse and said it was the best day in his life. Mary said, ""If I can help my brother and his family have a wonderful time relaxing for a week, knowing that their pet is being loved and cared for, what more could I ask for?""

Context: A ten-year-old boy from Howell, Michigan America is being hailed (...) a hero due to his persistence   that led to saving the life of an elderly neighbor. The chain of events unfolded late in the evening on Sunday, January 26th, 2014 when Danny Dipietro was being driven home from hockey practice by his dad.
That's when the young boy noticed an open garage and a figure that he believed was a dog outside an apartment near his house. Given the extremely cold weather, the young boy got a feeling that something was not right. But instead of dismissing   it like most kids at his age would have, he insisted that his mother, Dawn, go to examine what was going on. Dawn tried to convince   Danny that no one would leave a dog out in such cold weather, but he refused to take no for an answer.
Dawn finally gave in and decided to take a walk to the area with the family dog and see if there was any truth to Danny's premonition  . Sure enough, as she got closer to the apartment she noticed a garage that was wide open and a bent figure, waving madly. Upon getting there, she realized that it was not a dog that the young boy had seen, but Kathleen St. Onge, one of her neighbors. The 80-year-old had slipped on some ice in her garage and had been lying there for two hours, unable to get up.
Dawn rushed home to get her husband for help and called 911. The two then returned with some blankets to cover Ms. St. Onge, while they waited for the ambulance to arrive. Though still in hospital, the elderly woman is recovering well and grateful to Danny for his premonition. 
 Question:When Danny Dipietro's mother found the elderly woman, the elderly woman   _  . 
A. had lain in the garage for two hours 
B. was trapped in her garage with her dog 
C. was looking for her dog around the garage 
D. was lying on the ice outside the garage dead

Context: As I was thinking about language learning the other day, the image of baking bread came into my mind. I compared some of the exercises and drills that we put ourselves through in order to learn a language to the various ingredients  that go into baking a loaf of fresh bread.
Real language learning takes place in human relationships. No one sits down and eats a cup of flour, even if he is hungry and in a hurry. You don't become bilingual  by learning lists of vocabulary. You don't become a speaker of a language by memorizing verb conjugations   and agreement rules. You become bilingual by entering a community that uses that other language as its primary means of communication. 
I am not suggesting that we can make bread without ingredients. Flour is necessary, as are yeast , salt, water and other ingredients. Vocabulary is part of any language and will have to be learned. Grammatical rules exist in every language and cannot be ignored. But merely combining the appropriate ingredients in the recommended proportions does not result in bread. At best, you only end up with a ball of dough .
In order to get bread, you have to apply heat to the dough. And in language learning, that heat comes from the community. Anyone who has learned a second language has experienced that heat. It creeps up your neck when you ask the babysitter, ""Have you already been eaten?"" when you meant to say, ""Have you already eaten?"" When you try to say something quite innocent and the whole room bursts into laughter, you are experiencing the heat that turns raw dough into good bread.
Remember the old saying, ""If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen""? This is where language learning often breaks down because we find the heat uncomfortable and we stop the baking process. In order words, we can't stand the heat, so we get out of the kitchen.
However, the language learner who stays in the kitchen--in the heat--until the combined ingredients are thoroughly transformed will enjoy the richness of a quality loaf of bread. He is lad that he did not ""get out of the kitchen"" at the critical moment when the oven seemed too hot. The dedicated language learner knows that becoming bilingual cannot be achieved without the heat! 
 Question:The passage is mainly about   _  . 
A. how we can make baking bread with various ingredients 
B. how to become bilingual by communicating with others 
C. what an important role ""heat"" plays in learning a language 
D. what a high quality of bread you may achieve in the kitchen 
 Answer: C
Context: European Day of Languages falls on 26 September. BBC News Online reported the attitudes across several European Union countries to languages.
Tamsin Smith, Rome, Italy
Italians place very high importance on learning languages, particularly English. Twenty years ago it was quite difficult to find an English speaker here but today it is quite easy. The strong influence of American and English culture helps young people to learn the English language. They often become familiar with it through ""Harry Potter"" books or Disney movies. English schools, where Italian children are taught all their lessons in English, are also becoming popular among rich Italians.
Lucien Libert, Paris, France
Languages are very important in France. A good knowledge of the English language is necessary for many Frenchmen to get a good job and the more languages you can learn, the better. English is the first language you learn in school and you start very young. Most people have at least eight years of learning English at school. Learning German or Spanish comes next and Latin is also taught in most schools. While French people learn languages, there is also a movement to protect the French language.
James Helm, Dublin, Ireland
The English language predominates  in Ireland, but the ancient Irish language is a lasting source of pride and interest, and it remains a living tongue that is used in several areas. School are required to teach ancient Irish, and most students learn it as part of the subjects. There is a continuing discussion about how to protect the language best. In recent years some primary schools have introduced foreign language classes for younger students, and the Irish government has tried to encourage schools to offer more languages such as French, Spanish, German and Italian. 
 Question:What can help you get a better job in France? 
A. Studying abroad for at least one year. 
B. Learning English at younger ages. 
C. Knowing another language but French. 
D. Learning several languages well. 
 Answer: D
Context: Mr. Jackson lived in the center of London but he had a hotel near the airport. There a lot of foreigners stayed for night. He didn't know any other language but English and he found it difficult for him to understand the foreign visitors. Sometimes he had to use the gesture to talk with them, and tried his best to make himself understood. But he was often misunderstood   and it brought him a lot of trouble. A friend of his who taught a few foreign languages in a university would teach him. He was happy and studied hard. At first he learned some, but soon he found it wasn't very easy to remember the words and expressions. His friend advised him to write down the useful expressions in his notebook so that he could use them when necessary. He did as he was told. He found it helpful for him to do so.
One evening there were plenty of people in the dining-room. They were all busy eating something except a Japanese. He was wandering   there and waiting for his wife who was dressing herself up upstairs. Mr. Jackson thought to himself, "" The man wants to eat something but he doesn't know any English. Let me help him.""
As he knew only a little Japanese, he had to bring out his notebook and showed it to the man, pointing to the sentence ""I'm hungry.""
The Japanese had a look at it and gave him two pounds and left. 
 Question:As not all foreign visitors understand his gesture, sometimes Mr. Jackson  _  to communicate with them. 
A. succeeded 
B. lost heart 
C. failed 
D. gave up 
 Answer: C
Context: The advantages of an international language in the modern world are obvious. Thanks to modern methods of transport, we can travel everywhere more easily and more quickly than ever before, but the language problem still remains. Without a common language, there may be misunderstandings between people of different countries. There are two possible solutions to this problem: either we choose one of the main living languages of the world, or we make up an artificial  one. But neither solution is simple because no living language will be acceptable to everyone and because an artificial language, such as Esperanto, has no culture and would be thought boring by many learners.
It is often said that English is quickly becoming a world language. It is certainly the most widely used language in the world, and second only to Chinese in its number or native speakers, but there are certain worries of choosing English as an international language.
First of all, for political reasons and national pride, English is not acceptable to everyone as a world language. Many dislike its influence. English words enter their language and this often threats their own language. In France, a new word ""frangla is"" has been invented to describe the results. Although English is being taught in more and more schools abroad, the process is not always popular. Not every nation is prepared to accept the leading position of English in their education system 
 Question:The invention of the new French word ""franglais"" shows that   _  . 
A. French words enter the English language 
B. English words enter the French language 
C. the French language is becoming international 
D. the English language is becoming international

Based on the question, the option and the context select the most appropriate answer from the provided choices ""A."", ""B."", ""C."" and ""D."".
Context: Anne Whitney, a sophomore   at Colorado State University, first had a problem taking tests when she began college. ""I was always well prepared for my tests. Sometimes I studied for weeks before a test. Yet I would go in to take the test, only to find I could not answer the questions correctly. I would blank out because of nervousness and fear. I couldn't think of the answer. My low grades on the tests did not show what I knew to the teacher. ""Another student in biology had similar experiences. He said, ""My first chemistry test was very difficult. Then, on the second test, I sat down to take it, and I was so nervous that I was shaking. My hands were moving up and down so quickly that it was hard to hold my pencil. I knew the material and I knew the answers. Yet I couldn't even write them down!""
These two young students were experiencing something called test anxiety. Because a student worries and is uneasy about a test, his or her mind does not work as well as it usually does. The student cannot write or think clearly because of the extreme tension and nervousness. Contrary to people's common belief that poor grades are often a result of poor study habits, sometimes test anxiety plays a role in students' achieving low grades. Recently, test anxiety has been recognized as a real problem, not just an excuse or a false explanation of lazy students.
Special university advising courses try to help students. In these courses, advisors try to help students by teaching them how to manage test anxiety. At some universities, students take tests to measure their anxiety. If the tests show their anxiety is high, the students can take short courses to help them deal with their tensions. These courses teach students how to relax their bodies. Students are trained to become calm in very tense situations. By controlling their nervousness, they can let their minds work at ease. Learned information then comes out without difficulty on a test.
An expert at the University of California explains, "" With almost all students, relaxation and less stress are felt after taking our program. Most of them experience better control during their tests. Almost all have some improvement. With some, the improvement is very great. "" 
 Question:Poor grades are usually believed to be the result of  _  . 
A. poor sleeping habit 
B. laziness 
C. test anxiety 
D. inability to form good study habits

Context: Someone asked me, ""what do you think of youth?"" I showed him a can of COKE. See this?
""C"" means ""courage"". There's a seed in everyone's heart. As long as you really keep watering it, it will grow and harvest. Courage gives us the power to follow our dreams. Believe in yourself and be prepared for anything in the future.
""O"" stands for ""optimism"". When in trouble, some people feel disappointed but some people still keep their dreams. Be sure to choose the latter. Life is very much like a mirror. If you smile on it, it smiles back on you. If you frown, you will get a similar look in return. Throw away the sadness in your heart while filling it with brightness and hope.
""K"" can be understood as ""knowledge"". In order to keep up with the times, we should use knowledge to enrich ourselves. Knowledge is the food of thought and, as long as it is put in our brain, we will grow wiser.
""E"" is short for ""enthusiasm  "". Enthusiasm is the sign of youth. We use colourful paint-brushes in our hands to create the pictures of youth on our own. Let the sky and sea know we're young. Let out our enthusiasm wherever we go.
Drink a can of COKE. You will find your youth as refreshing   as a can of coke. Enjoy and value your youth. 
 Question:The seed in everyone's heart in fact is  _  . 
A. hope 
B. knowledge 
C. courage 
D. imagination

Context: The professor stood before his class of 30 senior biology students, about to pass out the final exam. ""I have been honored to be your teacher this term, and I know how hard you have all worked to prepare for this test. I also know most of you are off to medical school or graduate school next fall,"" he said to them.
""I can well understand how much pressure you are under to keep your grades up, and because I know you are able to understand this material, I am prepared to offer an automatic  ""B"" to anyone who would prefer not to take the final.""
In relief a number of students jumped up to thank the professor and left the class. The professor looked at the students who remained, and offered again, ""Any other takers? This is your last chance."" One more student decided to go.
There were seven students left. The professor closed the door. Then he handed out the final exam. There were only two sentences typed on the paper: ""Congratulations, you have just received an ""A"" in this class. Keep believing in yourself.""
I never had a professor who gave a test like that. It may seem like the easy way out of grading   a lot of exams, but it's a test that any teacher in any subject could and should give. Students who don't have confidence in what they've learned are ""B"" students at best.
The same is true for students of real life. The ""A"" students are those who believe in what they're doing because they've learned from both successes and failures. They have learned life's lessons, whether from formal education or the school of hard knocks, and become better people.
Take your cue  from Sir Edmund Hillary, the first person to reach the top of Mount Qomolangma: ""It's not the mountain we conquer  , but ourselves."" Don't let the biggest limit be yourself. 
 Question:According to the text, which of the following statements is TRUE? 
A. 22 students got a ""B"" in the final test without doing the paper. 
B. Most of the students would go to medical school shortly after the exam. 
C. There were actually no problems on the test papers for the students to work out. 
D. The way the professor tested his students would not be suitable for other subjects. 
 Answer: C
Context: When we talk about intelligence, we do not mean the ability to get good scores on certain kinds of tests or even the ability to do well in school subjects. By intelligence we mean a way of living and behaving, especially in a new or upsetting situation. If we want to test intelligence, we need to find out how a person acts instead of how much he knows what to do.
For instance, when in a new situation, an intelligent person thinks about the situation, not about himself or what might happen to him. He tries to find out all he can, and then he acts immediately and tries to do something about it. He probably isn't sure how it will all work out, but at least he tries. And if he cannot make things work out right, he doesn't feel ashamed that he failed; he just tries to learn from his mistakes. An intelligent person, even if he is very young, has a special outlook on life, a special feeling about life, and how he fits into it.
If you look at children, you'll see a great difference in what we call ""bright"" children and ""not bright"" children. They are actually two different kinds of people, not just the same kind with different amounts of intelligence. For example, the bright child really wants to find out about life, and he tries to get in touch with everything around him. But the unintelligent child keeps more to himself and his own dream world; he seems to have a walk between him and life in general. 
 Question:If an intelligent person failed, he would  _  . 
A. feel ashamed 
B. learn from his experiences 
C. try to find all he could 
D. make sure what result he would get

""Mr. Bear,"" the Princess said, ""you are welcome in Nahloo. Here we share with each other. We don't take things from each other.""
Broo thought about it for a moment and realized that he had made a mistake. ""Well,"" he said, ""maybe drinking all that milk wasn't the best idea.""

If you like, come back tomorrow and we can have the cookies together.""

Context: It was Saturday, so Mr. Smith did not have to go to work. It had snowed heavily the night before, and Mr. Smith's son Bobby had a new sledge  , which he had been very eager to try out for a long while. There was a good slope   in a park not far away from the Smiths' house -- a slope which children often used for their sledges, so Mr. Smith agreed to take Bobby there in the car. They put the sledge in and went off. 
When they reached the park, they found that there were already a lot of boys there, each boy with a sledge of his own. They were sliding down the slope at great speed, and then pulling their sledges up again for another go. 
Mr. Smith stood by, watching them with a smile. It was obvious that each and every one of them had much fun. After a few moments, Mr. Smith suddenly saw among the boys a kid who was small and poorly-dressed, and did not have a sledge. This boy had flattened out one old cardboard box, and was sliding down the slope on that. Mr. Smith felt very sorry for this poor boy, and determined to tell his son Bobby to share his new sledge with the boy. 
But before he could catch Bobby to speak to him, he was somewhat surprised -- and much more delighted -- to notice that several of the older boys in the park were already offering the poor boy their nice sledges. Mr. Smith watched them with greater interest -- and suddenly realized that the bigger boys were not doing this because they felt sorry for the poor boy, but because they enjoyed riding on his cardboard box more than on their own sledges. They were actually waiting eagerly and impatiently for a turn on the flattened cardboard box! 
 Question:What did Mr. Smith notice shortly after arriving at the park? 
A. Some boys were waiting for their turns to slide patiently. 
B. A poor boy didn't have a sledge but a flattened cardboard box. 
C. A big boy was sliding down the slope on a sledge at great speed. 
D. Many boys offered to share their own sledges with each other. 
 Answer: B
Context: It was a lovely day at the park and Stella Bianchi was enjoying the sunshine with her two children when a young boy, aged about four, approached her two-year-old son and pushed him to the ground.
""I'd watched him for a little while and my son was the fourth or fifth child he'd pushed,"" she says. ""I went over to them, picked up my son, turned to the boy and said, firmly, 'No, we don't push.'"" What happened next was unexpected.
""The boy's mother ran toward me from across the park,"" Stella says, ""I thought she was coming over to apologize, but instead she started shouting at me for blaming her child. All I did was let him know his behavior was unacceptable. Was I supposed to sit back while her kid did whatever he wanted and hurt other children?""
Getting your own children to play nice is difficult enough. Dealing with other people's children has become a hidden danger.
In my house, jumping on the sofa is not allowed. In my sister's house it's encouraged. I find myself saying ""no"" a lot when her kids are over at mine. That's OK between sisters but becomes dangerous when you're talking to the children of friends or acquaintances.
""Kids aren't all raised the same,"" agrees Professor Naomi White of Monash University."" But there is still an idea that they're the property of the parent. We see our children as a mirror of ourselves, so if you're saying that my child is behaving improperly, then that's somehow a criticism  of me.""
In those situations, it's difficult to know whether to approach the child directly or the parent first. There are two opinions.
""I'd go to the child first,"" says Andrew Fuller, author of Tricky Kids. ""Usually a quiet reminder that 'we don't do that here' is enough. Kids have antennae   for how to behave in different settings.""
He points out bringing it up with the parent first may make them feel careless, which could cause problems. Of course, approaching the child first can bring its own headaches, too.
This is why White recommends that you approach the parents first. Raise your concerns with the parents and ask them to deal with it,"" she says.
Asked how to approach a parent in this situation, psychologist Meredith Fuller answers: ""Explain your needs as well as stressing the importance of the friendship. Start with something like: 'I know you'll think I'm silly but in my house I don't want...'"" 
 Question:What should one do when seeing other people's kids misbehave according to Andrew Fuller? 
A. Talk to them directly in a mild way 
B. Complain to their parents politely 
C. Simply leave them alone 
D. Punish them lightly

Context: The accident at Lake Sherwood was in our backyard. An SUV had gone off the road,down a hill, and collided with a tree. When we heard the wreck, I remembered to say ""call 911"". My family was the first on the scene. Nick, my son, was on the cell phone with 911. He saw a friend who was a victim in the crash who was a 15 years old girl who was badly disfigured and had died instantly. It was a terrible scene.
There had been six people in the truck, all between 15 and 17 years old. My husband and I checked all the victims, and I picked one who was conscious and stayed with him. I talked with him and had him lay on the ground. When I asked him if he was hurt, he said he was sore all over. When help arrived, they asked me to stay and continue working with them. I did as Debbie Romine, .my instructor, said in class, and did what they wanted. They even said thank you before they left.
The sheriff deputies came by Saturday night to get our statements and play the 911 tape back, so Nick could identify all the voices in the background. They said over and over that the way he handled the call was the best they had heard in a long time. He was calm and worked with them even when he saw his friend who had died. The Sheriff's Department is sending some people over to help us work through our emotions.
The first aid and CPR course I took in January really helped me. I just didn't expect to put it to good use so soon.

Context: The Marches were a happy family. Poverty, hard work, and even the fact that Father March was away with the Union armies could not down the spirits of Meg, Jo, Amy, and Marmee, as the March girls called their mother.
The March sisters tried to be good but had their share of faults. Pretty Meg was often displeased with the schoolchildren she taught; boyish Jo was easy to become angry; golden-haired schoolgirl Amy liked to show up; but Beth, who kept the house, was loving and gentle always.
The happy days passed and darkness came when a telegram arrived for Mrs. March. ""Your husband is very ill,"" it said, ""come at once."" The girl tried to be brave when their mother left for the front. They waited and prayed. Little Beth got scarlet fever   when she was taking care of the sick neighbor. She became very ill but began to recover by the time Marmee was back. When Father came home from the front and at that joyful Christmas dinner they were once more all together.
Three years later the March girls had grown into young womanhood. Meg became Mrs. Brooke, and after a few family troubles got used to her new state happily. Jo had found pleasure in her literary efforts. Amy had grown into a young lady with a talent for design and an even greater one for society. But Beth had never fully regained her health, and her family watched her with love and anxiety.
Amy was asked to go and stay in Europe with a relative of the Marches. Jo went to New York and became successful in her writing and had the satisfaction of seeing her work published there. But at home the bitterest blow was yet to fall. Beth had known for some time that she couldn't live much longer to be with the family and in the spring time she died.
News came from Europe that Amy and Laurie, the grandson of a wealthy neighbor, had planned to be married soon. Now Jo became ever more successful in her writing and got married to Professor Bhaer and soon afterwards founded a school for boys.
And so the little women had grown up and lived happily with their children, enjoying the harvest of love and goodness that they had devoted all their lives to.

Context: Recently I fully understood that a little favor could really make a big difference. My daughter and I were, accidentally, in time to catch a falling heart just before it hit the ground.
It all started when Charlene, one of my co-volunteers at the library, asked if I could do her duty on Tuesday since her doctor appointment had been unexpectedly changed. I agreed, which meant I  was home on Friday instead of volunteering as previously planned.
My daughter, Mary, managers a book store in town. Mid-morning, she called to ask me for help. Would I buy a fifty dollar gift card, birthday card, and cake for one of Mary's assistant managers, Cindy?
Mary explained she had to call Cindy in to take the place of another assistant manager who was sick, but felt terrible about it when she discovered it was Cindy's birthday. Cindy insisted that it was just fine. But that was not what Mary thought, so she gathered enough money from other employees to throw a surprise party for Cindy. Since neither Mary, nor any of the other employees, could leave to pick up the _ , they were turning to me for help. Days later, Mary told me the wonderful rest of the story, ""Cindy cried and cried when we surprised her. After the party, Cindy told us that her boyfriend had chosen that morning to break up with her. To top that off, she only had 26 cents left in her bank account.""
We were surprised at the series of unexpected events that took place in order to circle Cindy with love and catch her falling heart just before it hit the ground. 
 Question:What can we learn about Mary? 
A. Shewasalearned careerwoman.

Context: A disheveled   man appeared in court Thursday on charges of murdering a Chinese woman whose fight with her attacker was seen on webcam  by her boyfriend in China. Police refused to release any details about the crime or its possible motive.
The body of York University student Liu Qian, 23, of Beijing, was found Friday in her apartment in Toronto a few hours after her boyfriend witnessed the attack, police said.
She was found undressed from the waist down but there were no obvious signs of sexual attack or trauma   severe enough to kill her. Police say it may be weeks before the results of an autopsy   are known.
Brian Dickson, 29, stood before the court in a wrinkled white shirt and blue jeans as a charge of first- degree murder was read out. He did not enter a plea. His case was held over until April 26.
Dickson was arrested Wednesday. Police only announced his name and his age and asked the media not to publish any photos of Dickson, saying it could compromise the investigation. Toronto police spokesman Tony Vella declined to respond to the request further.
Liu's father, Liu Jianhui, who arrived from China after being informed of his daughter's death, thanked authorities for their quick action.
""I sincerely thank the people concerned with my daughter's case,"" he told reporters after the arrest. ""Our daughter was studying very hard.""
Police released no motive or details about Dickson, but one friend described the Toronto man as _ .
Patricia Tomasi, a friend of Dickson's, told The Associated Press that she acted in a play at a local theater in Toronto with Dickson in 2007.
""He doesn't seem like the type but that's what they always say,"" Tomasi said. ""He's tall with boyish good looks. I don't know much about him except that he wanted to be an actor.""
Dickson attended York University where he studied global politics, but did not earn a degree from there.
He later worked for the Atlantic Council of Canada (ACC), where he served as an assistant to the president Juilie Lindhout. According to his biography on a newsletter from the Atlantic Council of Canada, Dickson has also been a running instructor and has been involved with Developments in Literacy, a Pakistani aid organization that raises money for children in Pakistan.
A statement from the Atlantic Council of Canada on Thursday said it was not council policy to comment on staff, but it confirmed that Dickson had been an intern  with the council from September 29, 2008, until March 27, 2009.
Liu was chatting with her boyfriend, Meng Xianchao, by webcam at about 1 am. Friday when a man knocked on the door, police said.
Meng reported seeing a struggle break out between the two before Liu's webcam was shut off. Meng contacted other friends in Toronto who in turn called police.
The victim's father, Liu Jianhui, said his daughter studied at Beijing City University before moving to Canada, where she met Meng.
Liu Qian's laptop computer, webcam and mobile phone were taken from the apartment the night of the attack, police said. Police said the online chat was on a live streaming camera and was not recorded, though investigators were trying to figure out if there was any way they could recover it.
York University, whose campus is located near one of Toronto's rougher neighborhoods, is one of Canada's largest universities with more than 53,000 undergraduate and graduate students. About 3,200 of York's students come from more than 150 foreign countries, the university's website says. 
 Question:What can be inferred from the text? 
A. Developments in Literacy raises money for all children 
B. Seeing the struggle, Meng contacted Toronto police. 
C. Dickson had no bad records before the murder. 
D. Investigators could recover the chat record online. 
 Answer: C
Context: COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A group of black parents and civil rights activists presented a petition  Thursday calling for officials to drop charges against a 16-year-old South Carolina high school student who was videotaped being dragged from her desk and thrown to the floor by a police officer in her classroom.
The group said it was unfair and unacceptable that the student and her 18-year-old classmate at Spring Valley High School who taped the incident were the only people charged that day when authorities already knew Richland County Deputy Ben Fields had tossed the girl from her desk to the ground.
They also said their petition had hundreds of thousands of names from around the country asking prosecutor Dan Johnson to drop the ""disturbing schools"" charges against the teens. The students in the case are black; Fields is white.
Johnson issued a statement Wednesday saying he won't do anything with the case until the FBI finishes its investigation into Fields, who was fired after the video became public. ""I do not simply decide cases based upon feelings, public opinion or sentiment, nor do I decide them based on political pressure,"" Johnson said in the statement.
Disturbing schools is punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 or 90 days in jail. The students' lawyer did not respond to telephone messages.
The video spread quickly across the country, prompting questions about when police officers should get involved with classroom discipline. Fields was called to the classroom after the student refused to stop using her cellphone, and then she would not leave the classroom for a teacher or administrator.
In the days after the incident, the teacher turned her class over to a substitute and the administrator was placed on leave. Richland two officials didn't respond to an email asking about their current status. The students were allowed back in school.
Organizers of the protest said they plan to be at South Carolina's Statehouse next year, calling for legislators to change the law that allows police officers to arrest students for misbehaving at schools. Richland County Sheriff Leon Lott blamed that law for escalating the situation. ""Let's find a way where we don't saddle students with arrest records,"" said EfiaNwangaza from the Malcom X Center for Self Determination. ""Let's get ahead of the schoolhouse-to-jailhouse train in South Carolina."" 
 Question:What is Don Johnson's attitude towards the case? 
A. Indifferent 
B. Ambiguous 
C. Subjective 
D. Cautious

Context: It all began with a stop at a red light.
Kevin Salwen was driving his 14-year-old daughter, Hannah, back from a sleepover in 2006 . While waiting at a traffic light, they saw a black Mercedes Coupe on one side and a homeless man begging for food on the other.
""Dad, if that man had a less nice car, that man there could have a meal.""Hannah protested. The light changed and they drove on, but Hannah was too young to be reasonable. She pestered  her parents about _ insisting that she wanted to do something.
""What do you want to do?"" her mom responded. ""Sell our house?""
Warning! _ . Hannah seized upon the idea of selling the luxurious family home and donating half the proceeds to charity, while using the other half to buy a more modest replacement home.
Eventually, that's what the family did. The project --crazy, impetuous   and utterly inspiring -- is written down in detail in a book by father and daughter scheduled to be published next month: ""The Power of Half."" It's a book that, frankly, I'd be nervous about leaving around where my own teenage kids might find it. An impressionable child reads this, and the next thing you know your whole family is out on the street.
At a time of enormous needs in Haiti and elsewhere, when so many Americans are trying to help Haitians by sending everything from text messages to shoes, the Salwens offer an example of a family that came together to make a difference -- for themselves as much as the people they were trying to help. In a column a week ago, it described neurological evidence from brain scans that unselfishness lights up parts of the brain normally associated with more primary satisfaction. The Salwens' experience confirms the selfish pleasures of selflessness.
Mr. Salwen and his wife, Joan, had always assumed that their kids would be better off in a bigger house. But after they downsized, there was much less space to retreat to, so the family members spent more time around each other. A smaller house unexpectedly turned out to be a more family-friendly house. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage? 
A. Mercedes Coupe is only an ordinary car which is quite cheap. 
B. Unselfishness has nothing to do with people's primary satisfaction. 
C. Hannah asked her parents to do something charitable and they sold their house. 
D. The writer's children asked him to sell their house. 
 Answer: C

Context: It was a long process that involved creating a resume, submitting an online application  and attending a round of interviews. Naturally Tan Kaiyin, a 21-year-old student is excited when she was selected, as more than 660, 000 people signed up to volunteer at the 16thAsian Games in Guangzhou, but only less than 10 percent were finally chosen to work in the venues and wear the white and green sport uniforms.
Like in any major sporting event, volunteers play a vital role in assisting with operations and Tan's function here is not any different. She is based at the Garden Hotel and is tasked with helping guests and officials who have issues with their accreditation cards . ""I deal with guests from all over the world, I have never met so many international people and it is very, very exciting to have this opportunity to interact with them. They come to the office because they need to make a change in their accreditation card and usually they are in a hurry, so we try our best to get it done quickly."" 
She admits the first few days involved extremely long hours, however she likes the challenge as it gives her an immense sense of satisfaction especially when an irate guest turns a frown into a smile and says ""thank you"". 
Tan deals with people from different cultures and personalities and feels she has learned so much in the past week, an experience that she would have never gotten if not for the Guangzhou Asian Games, therefore she is very happy and grateful for being a part of this. She also has kind words for her managers and fellow colleagues and says the hard work and positive atmosphere has bonded them into a family. She enjoys her responsibilities so much that she is afraid of feeling lost when the Games finally end on Nov. 27. 
However, she is aware of all the positive effects the Games have had on Guangzhou. From improvements to air and water quality to better transportation and infrastructure in the city, but most importantly to her is the fact that the Asian Games has placed Guangzhou prominently onto the world map. This, she believes, will encourage people from all over the world to continue visiting her city, and this in turn will give the residents of Guangzhou a fantastic opportunity to continue learning about different cultures. The official Asian Games Volunteer Slogan is, ""Together, we can make it better!"" Indeed it seems they can. 
 Question:In Tan's opinion, what is NOT the positive effects the Games have had on Guangzhou

B. Asian Games has place Guangzhou prominently onto the world map. 
C. The Game will give the residents of Guangzhou a fantastic opportunity to continue learning about different cultures.

Context: Not so long ago almost student who successfully completed a university degree could find a good career quite easily. However. those days are gone, even in Hong Kong, and nowadays graduates often face strong competition in the search for jobs.
Job seekers first have to make a careful assessment of their own abilities. One area of assessment should be of their academic qualifications, which would include special skills within their subject area. Graduates should also consider their own personal values and attitudes, or the   importance to themselves of such matters as money, security, leadership and caring for others.
The second stage is to study the opportunities available for employment.
Job application forms and letters should, of course, be filled in carefully and correctly, without grammar or spelling errors.
When graduates are asked to attend for interview, they should prepare properly by finding out all they can about the prospective employer. Dressing suitably and arriving for the interview on time are also obviously important. Interviewees should try to give positive and helpful answers and should not be afraid to ask questions about anything they are unsure about. This is much better than pretending to understand a question and giving an unsuitable answer.
It is true that it is hard to find a good job. But there will always be good career opportunities for people with ability, skills and determination; the secret to securing good jobs in to be one of them. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is true?

B. To find out what jobs are available is totally impossible 
C. To find a job is much more difficult than before 
D. The education you receive has nothing to do with job-hunting

Context: Most students, when asked about their ideal graduation gift, would probably reply, ""A car"", or ""Money for a deposit on a house"". Cai Kaiyuan, 21, made a different choice. As a graduation gift to himself, he decided to work as a volunteer teacher in a remote village in Tibet.
Cai, a senior majoring in electrical engineering at Huan Railway Professional Technology College, originally planned to cycle from Sichuan to Tibet. During his journey, Cai's idea for a different graduation gift to himself began to take shape. ""I did not know beforehand what the journey would mean to me. I just want to gain a unique experience and have pleasure in appreciating the view there,"" he said.
It turned out cycling on a plateau was extremely challenging. And it has kept changing his outlook on life. Cai's fingers even became frostbitten while cycling up a 5008-meter-high mountain, where temperatures often dropped to 18 below zero. At night, the ice covered the road and he fell off his bike three times. The lack of oxygen made him feel dizzy and weak. ""At the most serious moment, I felt that my life was _ ,"" said Cai.
However, he also gained something unexpected. At Ya'an, a city in Sichuan, he met a group of tourists who are also university students. A girl called Wu Ling told him that she planned to work as a teacher in a primary school in Tibet after her journey. He was impressed by the idea as she looked slender and weak.
It was not until he reached a family-run hotel in Shigatse that Cai's spirits began to rise. The hotel manager's two daughters enjoyed talking with him. The kids asked about his experiences on his trip, and showed him the beautiful local lakes. ""They told me that they always liked to talk to guests, as they wanted to improve their Mandarin,"" he said, ""Their parents and many locals can only speak Tibetan.""
Cai was touched by the girls' story. Their situation is tough and the local people have little chance to learn Mandarin because the schools are short of teachers. ""I want to do something to improve the situation for kids like them,"" said Cai. His parents finally gave their agreement and his teachers also supported him. 
 Question:According to the passage, Cai Kaiyuan's graduation gift to himself is   _  . 
A. to have money for a deposit on a house 
B. to travel by cycling from Sichuan to Tibet 
C. to own a new car and marry a slender girl 
D. to work as a volunteer teacher in Tibetan school

Context: I learned how our attitudes made a big difference in our everyday lives from my friend Mary.
She doesn't have any pets. I happened to see her outside on a -30 degree morning walking a dog. I felt sorry for Mary, out there walking a dog that's not hers in such cold weather. I thought maybe she was saying to herself, ""Yeah, this is why I don't have any pets! I hate walking dogs.""
Later that day I saw Mary and said, ""I saw you out there walking a dog this morning. Are you unhappy because you had to walk it on such a cold day?"" To my surprise, she said that she enjoyed getting out there and walking the dog and that she got good exercise because of the dog. She also said she had talked to her brother, the dog's owner, who was on holiday in Orlando, Florida with his family. He said his children were enjoying Disney World and the resorts  . His four-year-old son had breakfast with Mickey Mouse and said it was the best day in his life. Mary said, ""If I can help my brother and his family have a wonderful time relaxing for a week, knowing that their pet is being loved and cared for, what more could I ask for?""

Context: When I was six, dad brought home a dog one day, who was called ""Brownie"". My brothers and I all loved Brownie and did different things with her. One of us would walk her, another would feed her, then there were baths, playing catch and many other games. Brownie, in return, loved each other and every one of us. One thing that most touched my heart was that she would go to whoever was sick and just be with them. We always felt better when she was around.
One day , as I was getting her food, she chewed up one of dad's shoes, which had to be thrown away in the end. I knew dad would be mad and I had to let her know what she did was wrong. When I looked at her and said, ""Bad girl,"" she looked down at the ground and then went and hid. I saw a tear in her eyes.
Brownie turned out to be more than just our family pet. She went everywhere with us. People would stop and ask if they could pet her. Of course she'd let anyone pet her. She was just the most lovable dog. There were many times when we'd be out walking and a small child would come over and pull on her hair. She never barked or tried to get away. Funny thing is she would smile. This frightened people because they thought she was showing her teeth. Far from the truth, she loved everyone. 
 Question:Which of the following best describes Brownie? 
A. Shy 
B. Polite 
C. Brave 
D. Caring

Context: Four days after Dad's 67thbirthday, he had a heart attack. Luckily, he survived. But something inside him had died. His enthusiasm for life was gone. He refused to follow doctor's orders, and his sour attitude made everyone upset when they visit him. Dad was left alone.
So I asked Dad to come to live with me on my small farm, hoping the fresh air would help him adjust. Within a week after he moved in, I regretted the invitation. He criticized everything I did. I became frustrated. Something had to be done.
One day I read an article which said when given dogs, depressed patients would be better off. So I drove to the animal shelter that afternoon. As soon as I got there, a pointer's eyes caught my attention. They watched me calmly.
A staff member said: ""He got here two weeks ago and we've heard nothing. His time is up tomorrow.""
I turned to the man in horror. ""You mean you're going to kill him?""
""Ma'am,"" he said gently. ""We don't have room for every unclaimed dog.""
The police's calm brown eyes awaited my decision. ""I'll take him,"" I said.
I drove home with the dog on the front seat beside me. I was helping it out of the car when Dad walked onto the front porch. ""Look what I got you!"" I said excitedly.
Dad wrinkled his face. ""I don't want it,"" he muttered, turning back towards the house. Then, suddenly, the dog pulled free from my grasp. He sat down in front of my Dad.
Dad's anger melted, and soon he was hugging the dog.
This was the beginning of a warm friendship. Dad named the dog Cheyenne. Together they spent long hours walking down dusty lanes and relaxing on the banks of streams.
Dad's bitterness faded, and he and Cheyenne went on to make many friends. Then, late one night two years later, I felt Cheyenne's cold nose burrowing   through my bed covers. He had never before come into my bedroom at night. I ran into my father's room and found that he had passed away.
Two days later, my shock and grief deepened when I discovered Cheyenne lying dead beside Dad's bed. As I buried him near their favorite stream, I silently thanked the dog for restoring Dad's peace of mind. 
 Question:After the author's father survived the heart attack, he   _  . 
A. ignored everyone who visited him 
B. became unpleasant toward other people 
C. was left alone to get full rest 
D. no longer wanted to live

Context: Every day as I drove through town, I saw a one-legged man going through the dustbins next to McDonalds looking for food. It was only a month before Christmas, starting to get cold and I could not help thinking about him.
So I bought a brush, pack of cigarettes, cans of fish, and then I added a blanket and sweatshirts. I made a box up like a present and went in search of this man. I saw him hobble   away from the dustbin. I pulled over, took the box and went up to him. I said, ""I would like to give you a Christmas present, there are some food items in here and some things you might be able to use.""
He sidestepped around me and said, ""No, thank you. I just had lunch. I don't need anything."" Then he hobbled on down the sidewalk, leaving me standing there in tears. I took the box down to a little shop that gave things out to the poor and homeless and told them what had happened and asked them to give the box to someone who could use it. The person there told me not to be upset and let my feelings be hurt as I was still crying. I told her I was not crying for me but for him because what I had done took away his dignity by treating him like a person in need. I was so ashamed.
A few years later I was able to volunteer in St. Anthony's Dining Room in San Francisco. These people had to stand in line for up to 6 hours to receive the only food they will get. We took one tray   of food at a time, and treated them as if they were in a restaurant ordering a meal they were paying for. 
From this I learned a great lesson. Accepting help is sometimes harder than giving it. 
 Question:The man refused to get the present because he   _  . 
A. had just had lunch 
B. didn't need anything right now 
C. didn't know the author 
D. wanted to maintain his dignity 
 Answer: D
Context: One night there was a woman at the airport who had to wait for several hours before getting her next flight. While waiting, she bought a book and a pack of biscuits to spend the time. She looked for a place to sit and waited. She was reading her book, when suddenly she realized that there was a young man sitting next to her who was stretching his hand, and grabbing the pack of cookies lying between them. He started to eat them one by one. Not wanting to make a fuss about it ,she decided to ignore him. The woman ate the biscuits and watched the clock, while the young thief was also eating them. The woman started to think, ""If I weren't such a good and educated person, I would have hit this man by now.""
Every time she ate a biscuit, he had one, too. The dialogue between their eyes continued and when only one biscuit was left, she wondered what he was going to do. Softly and with a nervous smile, the young man grabbed the last biscuit and broke it into two. He offered one half to the woman while he ate the other half. Briskly she took the biscuit and thought, ""What a bad man! How uneducated! He didn't even thank me!""
She had never met anybody who made her so angry, and was pleased when her flight was ready. She grabbed her bags and went towards the gate not looking back to where that thief was seated. After getting on the plane and being seated, she looked for her book which was almost finished by now. While looking into her bag she was totally surprised to find her pack of biscuits. ""If my biscuits are here,"" she thought, feeling bad, ""those others were his and he tried to share them with me.""Too late to say sorry to the young man, she realized with pain, that it was her who had been an uneducated thief, but not him.

A. because she was hungry then. 
B. Because the biscuits were on sale. 
C. because she wanted to kill time

Context: When I was at university,  I studied very hard. But a lot of my friends did very little work. Some did just enough to pass exams. Others didn't do quite enough. Fred Baines was one of them.

""Oh good,"" he said, ""Have you got the results of the test?""

""One, then? Certainly somebody finished one."" But the class kept silent . The teacher said, ""That is what I thought. I just want to make you know clearly that you finished four years of study, but there are still many things about the subject you don't know. These questions you could not answer are common  in everyday life."" Then, he smiled and said ""You will all pass this exam, but it doesn't mean that you learned the subject well.

Context: Do you want to do well in exams? Sometimes your knowledge is not enough, you also need good strategies. Here are some for you:
Before you answer the questions, if you feel a little nervous, take a few deep breaths to help you relax.  Always read the question carefully and make sure that you understand it. Read it a few times if possible.  Find out how much each question is worth or how many points you need.  If it asks to give one answer, only write one.
If there is a difficult question, don't worry. Go on to the next question and come back to it if you have time later.  Try not to leave questions unanswered when you finish the test. Sometimes a guess may get your points.
When you finish, go back and check your answers. You will need to check your writing or spelling mistakes. 
 Question:Which of the following is NOT true according to the passage? 
A. Find out how many points we need or how much each question is worth. 
B. Try not to leave questions unanswered when we finish the test. 
C. If it asks to give one answer, we'd better write more. 
D. Sometimes we should guess the answers to get points.

Context: We always celebrated Dad's birthday on Thanksgiving Day, even after he entered a nursing home. When we knew it might be his last birthday, the whole family decided to get together for a huge birthday celebration at the nursing home.
Dad was a good storyteller and we were always his listeners. During a quiet moment, I announced it was now Dad's turn to listen to stories for a change. I wanted everyone to tell Dad what we loved about him. The room became quiet. Then one after another, people told stories from their hearts, while Dad listened with tears in eyes.
Everyone seemed to have more than one story. Even the little grandchildren couldn't wait to tell Dad why they loved him. For a man who had been kind to so many hundreds of people in his life, here was our chance to tell him how much we love him. A few months later, at Dad's memorial service, we more fully realized what we had given to Dad that night. Those are the stories people normally tell at a funeral   after a loved one is no longer alive to hear the words. They tell stories, full of tears. But we had given those memories to Dad in his life, and we had told them through laughter, together with hugs and joy. He had them to hold and enjoyed them from time to time in his mind during his last days and months.
Words do matter, and they are enough. We just need to say them or to speak them publicly the ones we love. That's the ways to give back love and that's our chance to celebrate a person in his or her life.

Context: For their nick-of-time acts, Toby, a 2-year-old dog, and Winnie, a cute cat, were named Dog and Cat of the Year by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
As Amy Paul choked  on a piece of apple at her home, her dog jumped up, landing hard on her chest and forcing the piece in her throat out. When the Keesling family of Indiana was about to be killed by carbon monoxide, their cat clawed at the wife Cathy's hair until she woke up and called for help.
No one could explain their timely heroics.
Both pets were rescued by their owners in _ -----Toby as a 4-week-old thrown into a garbage bin to die, and Winnie as a week-old orphan hiding under a barn, so helpless that Cathy's husband, Eric, had to feed her milk with an eyedropper.
As the Keeslings recalled it, a gas-driven pump being used broke down, spreading carbon monoxide through the house. By the time Winnie went to rescue, the couple's 14-year-old son was already unconscious. ""Winnie jumped on the bed and was clawing at me, with a kind of angry sound,"" Cathy Keesling said. The state police responding to her 911 call said the family was only minutes from death, judging by the amount of poisonous gas in the house.
Amy Paul's husband was at his job when she took a midday break from making jewelry and bit into an apple. ""Normally I peel them, but I read in Good Housekeeping Magazine that the skin has all the nutrients, so I ate the skin, and that's what caused me to choke,"" she recalled. ""I couldn't breathe and I was in panic when Toby jumped on me. He never does that, but he did, and saved my life.""
Both Toby and Winnie accompanied their owners to the awards luncheon. 
 Question:Winnie saved the lives of its owner's whole family in an accident by   _  . 
A. jumping onto its owner 
B. calling for help 
C. making some strange noises

Context: Buster Brown was a thief and a good one too,he thought. He'd never been caught by the police because he never took chances.He was always prepared for any unforeseen event or emergency.
Confidently,he stood outside the house of his intended victim and read the sign on the front gate of the house.""Don't worry about the dog--be aware of the owner!"" it said.Buster smiled and found his way in.
The house looked quite normal outside,but inside it was very exotic with fascinating objects on display.As he began putting them into his bag,a dog came into the room.It stopped when it saw Buster,then wagged its tail madly and went over to him,licking his outstretched hand.  ""Good boy,"" Buster whispered. ""What a great guard dog you are--trying to lick me to death."" Satisfied he'd made friends with the dog,Bluster began to wander round the house,choosing items to put in his bag.His skilled eye picked out only the best antiques :a pair of silver candleholders,a silver tea-and-coffee service,etc..His new friend,the dog,sat and watched,as if wondering what was happening.
""Well,boy,"" Buster whispered,finally.""That might do.Any more and I won't be able to carry it!"" He swung the heavy bag onto his shoulders, just as the lights came on, nearly blinding him. He shielded his eyes with his hand.
""You're a very silly person,"" the figure in the doorway said, his voice dry and dust. As the man came closer, Buster could see he was well dressed. His face seemed familiar, but Buster couldn't quite place where he had seen him before.

Context: Dar and I loved to dance. It was probably the first thing we did together, long before we would share our lives.
We grew up in a small Oregon mountain community where dances were held almost every Saturday night. Dar was seventeen and l was thirteen when we first danced. He was one of the best dancers on the floor, and so was I. We always jitterbugged. No slow dancing for us; nothing remotely romantic.
Our fathers would stand along the wall and watch. Every once in a while, Dar's dad would smile a little and say, to no one in particular, but my dad could hear, ""Boy, my kid can sure dance."" _ he acted like he'd never heard. But a while later he would say, to no one in particular, ""That girl of mine can sure dance.""
Our dancing together stopped for five years while Dar was in the South Pacific in World War II. When we met again, Dar was twenty-two, and l was eighteen. We began to date and dance again. We were as good together as we remembered, and this time we added slow dancing.
For us, life is a dance, a movement of rhythms, directions, stumbles, missteps, at times slow and precise, or fast and wild and joyous. We did all the steps.
Two nights before Dar died, the family were with us. We all ate dinner together, and Dar sat with us. He hadn't been able to eat for several days. After dinner, I put on a Nat King Cole tape. Dar took me in his arms, weak as he was, and we danced and smiled. No tears for us. We were doing what we had loved to do for more than fifty years. It was our last dance---forever unforgettable. I wouldn't have missed it for the world. 
 Question:The author first danced with Dar when  _  . 
A. they were still in their teens 
B. they began to date each other 
C. they began to share their lives 
D. Dar returned from the South Pacific

Context: You're finishing up your history homework when your cell phone rings. You've got 30 minutes to reach head-quarters, get your equipment packed and receive your task. There's a lost hiker in the mountains near the edge of town. Your task: find the missing person; provide emergency medical treatment, if necessary; and be prepared to operate 48 hours on your own with only the supplies you carry.
Sounds like some kind of film's plot? Not if you're a member of the Arapahoe teen rescue patrol in the suburbs of Denver. About 25 teen guys and girls are active members of this search, rescue and emergency organization, and they know firsthand that you don't have to be an adult to save lives.
These 9th-through-12th graders are the real deal when it comes to emergency services. In fact, they're the only teen-commanded patrol in the nation. Sure they have adult advisers to turn to if necessary, but in the field it's a teen patrol officer calling the shots -- sometimes even giving direction to adults.
Members are trained in rock-high-angle,swift-water and avalanche rescue  , winter and alpine operation , wilderness life support and emergency care, among other skills. They also regularly ride along with the local fire and police departments, providing support such as security details and evidence searching.
When asked what qualities make a good patrol member, founder and president Stan Bush named good physical conditioning and an interest in helping people. ""We put in lots and lots of hours helping people in trouble,"" he says. ""So if a person is not really interested in doing that kind of thing, he won't last as a member."" 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. What qualities make a good patrol member? 
B. The Arapahoe teen rescue patrol 
C. How to become a rescue patrol member 
D. Skills a rescue patrol member needs

Context: Carly Zalenski's eyes filled with tears as the dusty bus ran down a dirt road in southern Vietnam. The 14-year-old and her family had traveled by plane from Canton, Ohio. Now, as they approached the village, hundreds of cheering schoolchildren lined the entrance to the Hoa Lac School, a two-story concrete building that Carly had raised money for.
    Carly started helping others at eight, handing out Thanksgiving baskets at church to families in need. It was a snowy day, and she saw many girls didn't have warm coats. The next November, she went door to door asking for used coats, hats, gloves and scarves, and then handed them out with the baskets.
   But Carly wanted to do more. She remembered her grandmother's Rotarv Club ("""") had, years earlier, raised money to build a school in Vietnam. That was what she now wanted to do.
   At 12, she began to raise money for Vietnamese children with a PowerPoint presentation. ""The kids in rural Vietnam don't have decent schools. I want to give them a place to make their lives better,"" she told a room of 200 Rotarians.
  That summer, Carly set off with her family across Ohio, visiting three or four Rotarv Clubs a week. ""We traveled like crazy people to all these meetings,"" recalls her mother, Kris.
   At first they got no donations. But one night, Carly and her dad, Fred, pulled up to a building in Minerva, Ohio. Carrying a laptop, a projector and a screen, they walked into a bar where 15 people were sitting around a long table. There was dead silence after Carly finished her presentation. Fred thought that was never going to work. Then someone made a motion: ""Let's give this girl check right now."" Minutes later, Carly walked out with her first donation: $500.
   Not everyone was  _ about the idea of helping Vietnam. ""Why should we help it?"" asked one veteran  . Carly replied simply, ""They're kids. And I'm just a kid who wants to help out.""
   As word spread, individual donors sent checks for as little as $5. A restaurant chain contributed $1,000. Carly's coach organized a tournament that netted $4,000. A bible camp bought 500 backpacks for the children. In two years, Carly raised $50,000. 
 Question:Why did Carly once collect used clothes from door to door? 
A. To donate them to a charity. 
B. To help Vietnamese children. 
C. To raise money for a Rotary Club. 
D. To give them to people in need.

Context: Listening to music while you drive can improve your speed and ability to get away from accidents, according to Australian psychologists. But turning your car radio up to full volume could probably make you end up in an accident. The performance of difficult tasks can be influenced if people are subjected to loud noise. The experience of pulling up at traffic lights alongside cars with loud music made some psychologists in the University of Sydney look into whether loud music has something to do with driving. 
The psychologists invited 60 men and women aged between 20 and 28 as subjects and tested them on almost the same driving tasks under three noise conditions: silence, rock music played at a gentle 55 decibels  , and the same music at 85 decibels.
For 10 minutes the subjects sat in front of a screen operating a simple machine like a car. They had to track   a moving disk on screen, respond to traffic signals changing color1, and brake in response to arrows that appeared without warning.
On the tracking task, there was no difference in performance under the three noise conditions. But under both the loud and quiet music conditions, the performers ""braked"" at a red light about 50 milliseconds sooner than they did when there was no rock music at all. That could mean a reduction in braking distance of a couple of meters actually, the difference between life and death for a pedestrian.
When it came to the arrows that appeared across the visual field, the psychologists found that when the music was quiet, people responded faster to objects in their central field of sight by about 50 milliseconds. For the people listening at 85 decibels, response times were dropped by a further 50 milliseconds -- a whole tenth of second faster than those ""driving"" with no music. 
 ""But there's a trade-off,"" the psychologists told the European Congress of Psychology. ""They lose the ability to look around the whole situation effectively."" In responding to objects that suddenly appeared, people subjected to 85-decibel rock music were around 100 milliseconds slower than both the other groups. Since some accidents -- such as children running into the road -- take place without any notice, drivers listening to loud music must be less safe as a result. 
 Question:On the whole, which of the following is the best way to make driving safer? 
A. Loud music. 
B. Quiet music. 
C. Silence. 
D. Heavy metal music. 
 Answer: B
Context: The week after Jane's birthday, Barbara and Mary were away. Jane decided to have a late birthday party. She telephoned several friends.

She herself bought some food and drink to get the party going. She took up all the carpets   so that they could dance. She did not know whether Barbara and Mary would have approved  , but as long as she was careful, she was sure that they would not mind. She warned the two people in the flat above and invited them down. 
""Oh, "" said Jane, surprised. ""What's all this about? ""
The first guests arrived soon after eight. The music was soon playing loudly and they started dancing. Some of Jane's friends brought other friends with them. As more and more people arrived,the noise increased. People started shouting at each other, so they turned the music up. This made it more difficult to hear each other above the music, so they shouted more loudly. At half past ten the bell rang. ""Turn down the music!"" someone shouted. ""Someone probably called the police."" When Jane opened the door, there was a policeman standing there. She started to apologize, ""I'm sorry about all the noise, officer. But you see, it was my birthday last week and I'm having a party."" ""Never mind about that, miss. We're here because of something much more important.""
""Well, there's been a report of burglary  . We think the thief may have come to your party, pretending to be a friend of someone here. ""

A. They got rather angry with each other. 
B. They were very glad to make new friends. 
C. They became too excited while dancing.

Context: Bobbi Kristina Brown's family has been gathered around her since she was hospitalized on Saturday after being found unconscious in the bathtub of her suburban Atlanta townhome.
Whitney Houston's only child is now at Emory University Hospital and is still fighting for her life, as a family statement said on Monday.
Nothing has changed, despite reports that are popping up and painting a more serious picture.
Fox News reported Wednesday that the situation is horrific. ""It's now a matter of when the family wants to let go and accept that she's pretty much not going to make it,"" a source told FOX411. ""They've left it up to the family as to how long they want to keep her alive.""
People Magazine is also reporting that a doctor told Brown's family on Wednesday that nothing more could be done. ""Everyone is coming to the hospital to say goodbye,"" said a family member.
And the Daily Mail says Brown has been taken off life support.
But Bobby Brown issued a statement late Thursday denying these reports.
""If we issued a statement every time the media published a false report regarding this matter, that's all we would be doing 24 hours a day. This is false, just as is the vast majority of the other reporting that is currently taking place,"" he said, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.
A source close to the family tells USA TODAY that it's wrong to say the family is gathering to say goodbye, because the family has been there since the beginning, so nothing is any different today for them.
Also, Brown is ""not brain dead,"" as has been reported.
And, as for other stories saying that the Houston family is feuding with Bobbi Kristina's dad, Bobby Brown? Those aren't true either. They ""are NOT fighting,"" says our source. 
 Question:Which can be the best title of the passage? 
A. An Accident In The Bathtub 
B. Kristina, We're Still Praying And Waiting On A Miracle 
C. False Reports From Different News Media 
D. Bobbi Kristina's Final Days

Context: Anne Whitney, a sophomore   at Colorado State University, first had a problem taking tests when she began college. ""I was always well prepared for my tests. Sometimes I studied for weeks before a test. Yet I would go in to take the test, only to find I could not answer the questions correctly. I would blank out because of nervousness and fear. I couldn't think of the answer. My low grades on the tests did not show what I knew to the teacher. ""Another student in biology had similar experiences. He said, ""My first chemistry test was very difficult. Then, on the second test, I sat down to take it, and I was so nervous that I was shaking. My hands were moving up and down so quickly that it was hard to hold my pencil. I knew the material and I knew the answers. Yet I couldn't even write them down!""
These two young students were experiencing something called test anxiety. Because a student worries and is uneasy about a test, his or her mind does not work as well as it usually does. The student cannot write or think clearly because of the extreme tension and nervousness. Contrary to people's common belief that poor grades are often a result of poor study habits, sometimes test anxiety plays a role in students' achieving low grades. Recently, test anxiety has been recognized as a real problem, not just an excuse or a false explanation of lazy students.
Special university advising courses try to help students. In these courses, advisors try to help students by teaching them how to manage test anxiety. At some universities, students take tests to measure their anxiety. If the tests show their anxiety is high, the students can take short courses to help them deal with their tensions. These courses teach students how to relax their bodies. Students are trained to become calm in very tense situations. By controlling their nervousness, they can let their minds work at ease. Learned information then comes out without difficulty on a test.
An expert at the University of California explains, "" With almost all students, relaxation and less stress are felt after taking our program. Most of them experience better control during their tests. Almost all have some improvement. With some, the improvement is very great. "" 
 Question:Poor grades are usually believed to be the result of  _  . 
A. poor sleeping habit 
B. laziness 
C. test anxiety 
D. inability to form good study habits

Context: Today's the day of a big test at school, and you feel awful. Your stomach hurts and you have a headache. Some people might feel their hearts beating quickly while they are waiting for the test paper. A student with really strong test _ may even feel like he or she might be sick or throw up .
Sound familiar? You'll find that just about all people--adults and others--have some anxiety before a test. According to studies, proper anxiety can be helpful, keeping you sharp and focused and even helping you get good grades. But when you have so much anxiety or feel so sick that you can't do well in your studies or tests, that's bad for your studies or your body health.
Of course, if you don't study for the test, you might be worried. That kind of anxiety isn't easy to deal with because even if you find a way to calm down, you still might not know what to do with it. When you are preparing for a test and you get a handle on your test, you will be able to let your knowledge work well and get good grades.
For example, last Wednesday was the day of a big test at school. Jane felt awful. Her stomach hurt and she had a headache. She knew she hadn't caught a cold--but only a little nervous about the test. She really didn't know why. 
 Question:When you feel too nervous in a test, you may  _  . 
A. improve yourself 
B. fail in the test 
C. get good grades

Context: 169 junior 1 students at No. 35 Middle School of Shenyang took their first noteacher exam. After the teacher handed out the exam paper, he left the room and never came back. A student collected the papers when the exam ended.
""That test was not only a test of knowledge, but also a test of moral  . We wanted to show students how important honesty is,"" said Cai Wenguo, the school's headmaster. The school says no cheating happened in the test. Next year, it wants 80% of its exams to be without teachers. But students have different ideas.
""I was happy and excited during the exam because my teachers trusted me,"" said Lang Yudan, a 13yearold girl in Class 11.
""Schools must trust students a lot not to use invigilators  . But I think it is too early. Some students will cheat if there are no invigilators. And the students will not be able to ask for help when needed,"" said Hua Sha.
""I don't like having invigilators in exams. When they walk around the classroom, they make me nervous. I would get higher marks without them in the room because I would feel more relaxed,"" Liu Qingxi said.
""I think it's very important to have invigilators in exams. Many students want to check their answers with each other after they have finished papers. And they can also keep the classroom in order when something unusual happens. They may make me nervous, but I still think we need them,"" Shangguan Yuan said.
Not using invigilators may be a good idea. But before using it, schools must tell students the importance of honesty and try to find ways to solve something unusual in exams.

Context: On Nov.18,1995,Itzhak Perlman,the violinist,came on stage to give a concert.If you have ever been to a Perlman concert,you know that getting on stage is no small achievement for him.He was stricken with polio  as a child,and so he walks with the aid of two crutches.
The audience sat quietly while he makes his way across the stage to his chair and begins his play.But this time,something went wrong.Just as he finished the first few bars,one of the strings on his violin broke.We thought that he would have to stop the concert.But he didn't.Instead,he waited a moment,closed his eyes and then signaled the conductor to begin again.
Of course,anyone knows that it is impossible to play a pleasant work with just three strings.I know that,and you know that,but that night Itzhak Perlman refused to know that.
When he finished,there was a breathtaking silence in the room.And then people rose and cheered.There was an extraordinary outburst of applause from every corner of the auditorium.
He smiled,wiped the sweat from this brow and then he said-not proudly,but in a quiet,holy attitude-""You know,sometimes it is the artist's task to find out how much music you can still make with what you have left.""
This powerful line has stayed in my mind ever since I heard it.And who knows?Perhaps that is the meaning of life-not just for artists but for all of us.
So,perhaps our task in this fastchanging,puzzling world in which we live is to make music,at first with all that we have,and then,when that is no longer possible,to make music with what we have left. 
 Question:What made Itzhak Perlman's performance at the concert special on Nov.18,1995? 
A. There were too many audience. 
B. He was late for the stage. 
C. He had a quarrel with the audience. 
D. One string of the violin got broken.

Context: ""It's over!Thank goodness!""
   School was over and I was tired.I sat at the front of the school bus.
   Janie,the driver,tries to break the uncomfortable atmosphere by striking the match of talks.I try to listen politely,but usually I am too busy thinking about my day.On this day,however,her talk was worth listening to.
   ""My father is ill,:she said to no one in particular.I could see worry in her eyes.I had never seen her like this before.She always meets students with a smile.
   With a sudden change of interest,I asked,""What's wrong with him?""
   With her eyes wet and her voice unusual,she answered,""Heart trouble.""Her eyes lowered as she continued,""I have already lost my mum,so I don't think I can stand losing him.""I couldn't answer.My heart ached for her.
   I sat on the seat thinking of great pain my own mother was thrown into when her father died.I saw how hard it was,and still is,for her.I wouldn't want anyone to go through that.
   Suddenly I realised Janie was not only a bus driver,that was just for her job.She had a whole world of family and cares too.
   I suddenly felt very selfish.I paid no attention to Janie because she was a bus driver,I had judged her by her joband brushed her off as unimportant.I shouldn't have been so selfish and self-centered. 
 Question:Why did the writer feel selfish?Because  _  .

Context: For the 17 years my life was very happy. Then the first sad thing happened. My mother became very ill, and soon she knew that she was dying. Just before she died, she asked Elizabeth and me to go to her room. She held our hands and said, ""Victor and Elizabeth, my children, I'm very happy because you love each other, and because one day you'll get married. Everyone in the family loves you, Elizabeth. Will you take my place in the family, my dear? I can die happy if you look after them when I have gone.""
My mother died and we were very sad, because we loved her dearly. Elizabeth was brave and helped us; her sweet smile gave us some happiness in the unhappy days after my mother's death. The time came for me to go to university. I didn't want to leave my sad family, but we all knew that I should go. It was hard to leave, too, because the parents of my good friend Henry would not let him go to university with me. So I had gone alone.
On my first day at university I met my teacher, Professor Waldman, who was one of the greatest scientists in the world. He gave a wonderful talk to all the students who were starting at the university. He ended his talk by saying, ""Some of you will become the greatest scientists of tomorrow. You must study hard and discover everything that you can. This is why God made you intelligent--to help other people.""
After the professor's talk, I thought very carefully. I remembered the storm when I was 15; I remembered how the lightning had destroyed the tree. From then on, I wanted to use electricity to help people, and I wanted to discover the secrets of life. I decided to work on these two things.
I started to work the next day. I worked very hard and soon Professor Waldman and I realized that I could learn to be a very good scientist.
The professor helped me very much, and other important scientists who were his friends helped me, too. I was interested in my work and I did not take one day's holiday during the next two years, I did not go home, and my letters to my family were very short.
After two years, I had discovered many things and I built a scientific machine that was the best in the university. My machine would help me answer the most important question of all. How does life begin? Is it possible to put life into dead things? To answer these questions about life I had to learn first about death. I had to watch bodies from the moment when they died and the warm life left them. In the hospital and in the university, I watched the dying and the dead. Day after day, month after month, I followed death, so it was a dark and terrible time.
I built a tall mast about 150 meters high, which is higher than the tallest building in the city, to catch lightning and send the electricity down to my machine in the lab. I believed I could use that electricity to give life to things that were dead.
Then one day, the answer came to me. Suddenly I was sure that I knew the secret of life. 
 Question:According to the author, the secret of life is to  _  . 
A. give life to things that were dead 
B. use electricity to help others 
C. build the best machine to learn about death 
D. become the greatest scientist of tomorrow

The second question is about speaking. Sam, from Suzhou wrote. ""Our school has a foreign teacher. But I'm shy and can't speak to her. What should I do?""
When I visit China, lots of people in the street say, ""Hello! How are you? Where are you from? Do you like China?"" These are good questions to start a talk. Many people are shy when they speak English, so before you begin, take a deep breath and smile! Smiling always helps.
The third question is about vocabulary. Oliver, from Anhui wrote, ""I want to remember all the new words. I write them down, but I forget them quickly. What should I do?""
Try to remember eight or ten words a day. Write them on pieces of paper and place them in your bedroom. Say the words when you see them, and change them every day. And when you're  shopping, how about counting the English words, or saying the English names for everything you see? 
 Question:What is Oliver's problem? 
A. He's too shy to talk with others. 
B. He's not able to count English words. 
C. He can't remember new words. 
D. He doesn't know what real English is.

Context: What is a six-letter word that immediately comes to mind when you need some information on the Internet? You probably thought of Google. But Google wasn't always the name of the famous search engine. In fact, the original name was BackRub!
BackRub was the name two graduate students gave to the new search engine they developed in 1996. They called it BackRub because the engine used backlinks to measure the popularity of Web sites. Later, they wanted a better name -- a name that suggests huge quantities of data. They thought of the word googol. (A googol is a number followed by 100 zeros.) When they checked the Internet registry of names to see if googol was already taken, one of the students misspelled the word by mistake, and that's how Google was born.
Google is just one example of a name change in the business world. Many other companies have decided to change their names or the names of their products. Here are some more examples:
Jerry Yang and David Filo, two young computer specialists, developed a guide to Internet content in 1994. They called it ""Jerry and David's Guide to World Wide Web."" But they soon realized that this wasn't a very catchy name, so they searched through a dictionary and found a better one: ""Yahoo.""
Sometimes companies change their names because of the popularity of one of their products. In 1962, a young runner named Phil Knight started a company called Blue Ribbon Sports. In 1971, Knight decided to design and manufacture his own brand of shoes. He named the shoes after the Greek goddess of victory -- Nike. Nike shoes became so well known that Knight changed the name of the whole company to Nike. 
 Question:Jerry and David changed the guide's name to Yahoo because the original name  _  . 
A. had been registered 
B. had been forgotten 
C. was not attractive 
D. was too short 
 Answer: C
Context: No one knows how man learned to make words. Perhaps he began by making sounds like those made by animals. Perhaps he grunted like a pig when he lifted something heavy. Perhaps he made sounds like those he heard all round him--water splashing, bees humming, a stone falling to the ground. Somehow he learned to make words. As the centuries went by, he made more and more new words. This is what we mean by language.
 People living in different countries made different kinds of words. Today there are about fifteen hundred different languages in the world. Each contains four or five hundred thousand words. But we do not need all these. Only a few thousand words are used in everyday life. The words you know are called your vocabulary  . You should try to make your vocabulary larger. Read as many books as you can. There are plenty of books written in easy language. Your dictionary is your most useful book. 
 Question:Form the passage we know that long long ago  _ 
A. no one learned how to make sounds or words 
B. animals taught man to learn the language 
C. man learned the language by lifting heavy things, falling to the ground, and so on 
D. man followed a lot of things in nature to make sounds and words

Context: It was something she had dreamed of since she was five. Finally, after years of training and intensive workouts, Deborah Duffey was going to compete in her first high school basketball game. The goals of becoming an outstanding player and playing college ball were never far from Deborah's mind.
The game was against Mills High School. With 1 minute and 42 seconds left in the game, Deborah's team led by one point. A player of Mills had possession of the ball,and Deborah ran to guard against her. As Deborah was running to block the player, her knee went out and she fell down on the court in burning pain. Just like that, Deborah's season was over.
After suffering the bad injury, Deborah found that, for the first time in her life, she was in a situation beyond her control. Game after game, she could do nothing but sit on the sidelines watching others play the game that she loved so much.
Injuries limited Deborah's time on the court as she hurt her knees three more times in the next five years. She had to spend countless hours in a physical clinic to receive treatment. Her frequent visits there gave her a passion and respect for the profession.  And Deborah began to see a new light in her life.
Currently as a senior in college, Deborah focuses on getting a degree in physical treatment. After she graduates, Deborah plans to use her knowledge to educate people how to best take care of their bodies and cope with the feelings of hopelessness that she remembers so well.

Context: The triathlon  promises to be one of the most popular Olympic sports.Recently it has drawn huge crowds attracted by athletes swimming 1,500m,cycling 40km,then running 10km without stopping.But what makes an attractive 17yearold girl give up everything for the doubtful pleasure it offers?
Melanie Sears has not yet learnt those oftenrepeated phrases about personal satisfaction,mental challenge and higher targets that most athletes use when asked similar questions.""You swim for 1,500m,then run out of the water and jump on your bike,still wet.Of course,then you freeze.When the 40km cycle ride is over,you have to run 10km,which is a long way when you're feeling exhausted.But it's great fun,and all worth it in the end,"" she says.
Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14 and she won the junior section.Full of confidence,she entered the National Championships,and although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run,she came nowhere.""I was following this man and suddenly we came to the sea.We realised then that we had gone wrong.I ended up cycling 20 kilometres too far.I cried all the way through the running.""
But she did not give up and was determined that she never will.""Sometimes I wish I could stop,because then the pain would be over,but I am afraid that if I let myself stop just once,I would be tempted  to do it again.""Such doggedness draws admiration from Steve Trew,the sport's director of coaching.""I've just been testing her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off and into a wall.She had given it everything,and she just kept on.""
Melanie was top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships,finishing 13th.""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running,but much slower in cycling.That's why I'm working very hard at it."" She is trying to talk her longsuffering parents,who will carry the PS1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's world championships,into buying a PS2,000 bike,so she can try 25km and 100km races later this year.
But there is another price to pay.""I don't have a social life,""she says.""After two hours' hard swimming on Friday night,I just want to go to sleep.But I phone and write to the other girls in the team."" What does she talk about?Boys?Clothes?""No,what sort of times they are achieving."" 
 Question:What upset Melanie during the National Championships? 
A. She was tricked by another competitor. 
B. She felt she had let her teammates down. 
C. She made a mistake during part of the race. 
D. She realized she couldn't cycle as fast as she thought.

Context: The girl was hanging by her hands from the railings of a balcony . The balcony was on the twelfth floor of the high-rise block next to his. His flat was on the ninth floor and he had to look up to see her. It was half-past six in the morning. He had been awakened by the sound of an aircraft flying dangerously low overhead, and had got out of bed to look. His sleepy eyes, moved from the blue sky which was empty of cloud, empty of anything but the bright disappearing arrow of the aircraft, and then rested on the hanging figure.
He really thought he must be dreaming, for this sunrise time was the hour for dreams. Then, when he knew he wasn't, he decided it must be a scene in a film. There were cameramen down there, a whole film unit, and all the correct safety precautions had been taken. Probably the girl wasn't even a real girl, but a dummy . He opened the window and looked down. The car park, paved courts, grass spaces between the blocks, all were deserted. On the balcony rail one of the dummy's hands moved, desperately. He had to believe then what was obviously happening. The girl was trying to kill herself. She had lost her courage and now was trying to stay alive. All these thoughts and conclusions of his occupied about thirty seconds. Then he acted. He picked up the phone and dialed the emergency number for the police.
The arrival of the police cars and the rescue of the girl became the focus of talk for the people of the two blocks. Someone found out that it was he who had called the police and he became an unwilling hero. He was a modest, quiet young man, and was in relief when the talk began to die away. Again he was able to enter and leave his flat without being pointed at as a kind of St George and sometimes even congratulated.

Francois started to harness the dogs. He needed a new lead-dog, and decided that Solleks was the best dog that he had. But Buck jumped at Solleks and took his place.
""Look at Buck!"" said Francois,laughing. ""He's killed Spitz,and now he wants to be lead-dog.Go away, Buck!""
He pulled Buck away and tried to harness Solleks again.Solleks was unhappy too. He was frightened of Buck, and when Francois turned his back,Buck took Solleks' place again. Now Francois was angry.
""I'll show you! "" he cried,and went to get a heavy club from the sledge.
Buck remembered _ ,and moved away. This time,when Solleks was harnessed as lead-dog,Buck did not try to move in.He kept a few meters away and circled around Francois carefully. But when Francois called him to his old place in front of Dave, Buck refused.He had won his fight with Spitz and he wanted to be lead-dog.
For an hour the two men tried to harness him.Buck did not run away,but he did not let them catch him.Finally,Francois sat down,and Perrault looked at his watch.It was getting late. The two men looked at one another and smiled. Francois walked up to Solleks,took off his harness, led him back and harnessed him in his old place.Then he called Buck. All the other dogs were harnessed and the only empty place was now the one at the front. But Buck did not move.
""Put down the club,"" said Perrault.
Francois dropped the club, and immediately Buck came up to the front of the team.Francois harnessed him, and in a minute the sledge was moving.
Buck was an excellent leader. He moved and thought quickly and led the other dogs well. A new leader made no difference to Dave and Solleks; they continued to pull hard.But the other dogs had had an easy life when Spitz was leading.They were surprised when Buck made them work hard and punished them for their mistakes. Pike,the second dog,was usually lazy;but by the end of the first day he was pulling harder than he had ever pulled in his life. The first night in camp Buck fought Joe,another difficult dog,and after that there were no more problems with him.The team started to pull together,and to move faster and faster.
""I've never seen a dog like Buck!"" cried Francois, ""Never! He's worth a thousand dollars. What do you think, Perrault? ""
Perrault agreed.They were moving quickly,and covering more ground every day. The snow was good and hard,and no new snow fell.The temperature dropped to 45degC below zero, and didn't change.
This time there was more ice on the Thirty Mile River, and they crossed in a day.Some days they ran a hundred kilometers,or even more. They reached Skagway in fourteen days; the fastest time ever. 
 Question:What did Francois think of Buck at the end of the passage? 
A. annoying 
B. admirable 
C. aggressive 
D. average

Context: Linda was kind of late. Linda, 25, had a lot to do at work, plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Linda felt weak and tired -- maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks.
Several yards away, Frank, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying.
But when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, ""Oh, my God, she fell in!""Frank didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. ""No ! Not you ! ""his girlfriend screamed after him.
She was right to be alarmed. By the time Frank reached Linda, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station.
It was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the arms and drag her away from the edge. That was where Linda briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse.
Linda thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in.
Police and fire officials soon arrived, and Frank told the story to an officer. Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40minute train ride downtown--just as he had been seconds after the rescue, which made her think about her reaction at the time. ""I saw the train coming and I was thinking he was going to die, "" she explained. 
 Question:How did Frank save Linda? 
A. By helping her rise to her feet. 
B. By lifting her to the platform. 
C. By pulling her along the ground. 
D. By dragging her away from the edge.

Everywhere there were people hurrying past or waiting to get into the buses, while I stood lost in the middle of them.
I was ready to cry. In despair, I crossed the street on to an ""island"", where I found a policeman. I took my last bit of courage in both hands and said, ""Please, sir, where is Addison Road?"" He began to explain, but when he saw that I couldn't understand he became helpless, too. ""Are you French at school?"" A few minutes later, he smiled and raised his hand. How wonderful!

Context: Did you know that a turtle can lay 12 eggs in one minute? A large sea turtle lays around 150 eggs at a time. She lays all these eggs in just a few minutes.
Large sea turtles live in the warm seas of the world. Except for when they lay their eggs, they spend their whole lives in the water. When it is time to lay their eggs, the females  swim to land.
They usually return to the place where they themselves were born. How they find their way back there is unknown.
When they reach shore, the big, heavy turtles crawl slowly up to the high water mark. Using their flippers, they pull themselves along the sand. They must struggle like mountain climbers.
When they finally reach dry sand, they rest before beginning the difficult task of laying eggs.
The turtles lay the eggs in deep holes and cover them with warm sand. The sand protects the eggs from harm. Then the females leave them. After a few weeks, if you happened to be walking along the beach, you might see the sand begin to shake. You may see tiny black balls coming out of the sand. The tiny heads of baby turtles!

Context: When the swim season began, my 11-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, and I cut a deal. She would go to practice three times a week and try really hard, and I wouldn't make her compete in the swim meets because on the day of a meet, she would be nervous all day. Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down.
Recently, they had a T-shirt relay, which works like this: one person from each relay team puts on a T-shirt and a pair of socks, swims 50 meters, and gets out of the pool. She takes off the clothes and puts them on the next person, who then swims 50 meters. This continues until everyone on the team has completed a lap.
By the last leg, Elizabeth's team had built up a moderate lead. Then it was Elizabeth's turn to swim. She seemed to swim faster in the T-shirt and socks than when she wasn't wearing them.
Approaching the halfway mark, she was still in the lead. Then one of Elizabeth's socks fell off and was floating in the pool. ""She has to get that sock on before the end of the race,"" a swimming official told her team, ""or you will be disqualified.""
Everybody on her team started screaming, ""Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Stop! Get the sock!"" But she couldn't hear them. As she started her last 25 meters, a girl in Lane 2 was gaining on Elizabeth. It was time for desperate measures. A girl on my daughter's team jumped in the pool, grabbed the sock, and swam after Elizabeth. She grabbed Elizabeth's foot. ""You have to put the sock on,"" the girl screamed. Elizabeth continued swimming while her teammate put on the sock.
By now, the girl in Lane 2 was about to pass Elizabeth. With the sock finally on, Elizabeth swam her heart out for the last 15 meters. It was close, but Elizabeth beat the other girl to the wall for the victory.
On the ride home, she relived her moment of glory again and again. She told me that if the T-shirt relay was an Olympic event, her team would win the gold medal. I told her that in my professional opinion, she was absolutely right. 
 Question:Elizabeth was nervous about swim meets because she   _  . 
A. was afraid of disappointing everyone 
B. didn't expect to lose the swim match 
C. didn't want to compete against other girls 
D. was worried about making errors in public

Context: The unwanted disturbing of a mobile phone ringing at a critical moment has led to some famously strong reactions
British actor Richard Grif-fiths,stopped a performance at the National Theatre and ordered The offending party to leave
Judge Robert Restaino went considerably further.He was hearing a session of domestic violence offenders in a court when proceedings were interrupted by rings of a phone.
""Everyone is going to jail unless I get that instrument now,"" he shouted.
Over the next two hours,the judge entered a period of ""incredible madness"".He began by ordering the doors of the court locked,and set the officers to searching for the phone.
When that failed to find the offending item he ordered each of the defendants  present in the room up to his bench and in turn asked them if they  had no idea, he sent each in turn to jail .
All 46 of them.
When a defendant protested the judge's actions were not fair to those who didn't possess the phone,Restaino replied:""I know it isn't.
Judge's actions caused chaos.Extra officers had to be drafted into the court to control the crowd.and booking officers at the city jail were at full stretch."" _ "", one said at the time.

Context: Around three forty-five on a rainy Saturday morning, I was woken up by the sound of my pager  beeping. As a volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, I can never count on a full night of sleep. I pulled myself out of bed and went toward the desk to grab my radio. Our crew was being sent to a nearby home where a man was in cardiac arrest  . We found the man lying on the kitchen floor with his wife beside him. We rushed the patient to the hospital, but despite our efforts, we were unable to save his life.
In my line of life, I rarely get any recognition from the patients we treat, or from their loved ones. But that night, a man's wife approached us, and through her tears, whispered, ""Thank you."" Then she hugged each of us. She knew we answered her late-night call for help, even though the ending was not positive.
There is something deeply rewarding about helping people in these circumstances. Sometimes, I'm able to make their worst day a bit better: like seeing the tears of an injured child turn into a smile when I gave him an interesting toy; or watching a terrified mother's screams turn into tears of joy when she realized her baby was going to be fine.
Experiences like these allow me to see the impact my work has on others. At the same time, I also know the effect _ has had on my own life. As a teenager, I felt awkward when my dad hugged me and said, "" I love you, my dear son."" I was equally uncomfortable and responded, ""I love you."" But then I imagined him lying on the kitchen floor that rainy night and realized that my opportunity to say those three words could---at any moment---be taken away forever. Now, I extremely treasure the moment when my father says those three words to me. I've learned to appreciate every relationship I have, to tell people I care about them, and to never take anything in life for granted. 
 Question:The author mentioned the injured child and the terrified mother to show that  _  . 
A. Life was not always pleasant 
B. His help could bring people happiness 
C. He saved a lot of people 
D. They were very grateful to him

Context: The day my husband fell to his death,it started to snow,just like any November day.His body,when I found it,was lightly covered with snow.It snowed almost every day for the next four months,while I sat on the couch and watched it pile up.One morning,I _ downstairs and was surprised to see a snow remover clearing my driveway and the bent back of a woman shoveling my walk.I dropped to my knees,crawled through the living room.And back up stairs so those good people would not see me.I was embarrassed.My first thought was,how would I ever repay them? I didn't have the strength to brush my hair let alone shovel someone's walk.
Before John's death,I took pride in the fact that I rarely asked for help or favors,I defined myself by my competence and independence.So who was I if I was no longer capable and busy? How could I respect myself if all I did was sit on the couch every day and watch the snowfall?
Learning how to receive the love and support that came my way wasn't easy.Friends cooked forme and l cried because I couldn't even help them set the table.""I'm not usually this lazy,""I wept.Finally,my friend Kathy sat down with me and said,""Mary,cooking for you is not a burden. I love you and I want to do it.It makes me feel good to be able to do something for you.""
Over and over,I heard similar emotions from the people who supported me during those dark days.One very wise man told me,""You are not doing nothing.Being fully open to your sorrow may be the hardest work you will everdo.""
I am not the person I once was,but in many ways I have changed for the better.My heart is now filled with thanks for people around me.I have been surprised to learn that there is incredible freedom that comes from facing one's worst fear and walking away whole.I believe there is strength,for sure,in accepting a dark period of our life.

Context: We discuss the issue of when to help a patient die. Doctors of our generation are not newcomers to this question. Going back to my internship days, I can remember many patients in pain, sometimes in coma , with late, hopeless cancer. For many of them, we wrote an order for heavy medication--morphine by the clock. This was not talked about openly and little was written about it. It was essential, not controversial.
The best way to bring the problem into focus is to describe two patients whom I cared for. The first, formerly a nurse, had an automobile accident. A few days later her lungs seemed to fill up; her heart developed dangerous rhythm disturbances. So there she was: in coma, on a breathing machine, her heartbeat maintained with an electrical device. One day after rounds, my secretary said the husband and son of the patient wanted to see me. They told me their wife and mother was obviously going to die; she was a nurse and had told her family that she never wanted this kind of terrible death, being maintained by machines. I told them that while I respected their view, there was nothing deadly about her situation. The kidney  failure she had was just the kind for which the artificial kidney was most effective. While possibly a bit reassured, they were disappointed. Here was the head surgeon seemingly determined to keep everybody alive, no matter what.
Within a few days the patient's pacemaker  could be removed and she awoke from her coma. About six months later, the door of my office opened and in walked a gloriously fit woman. After some cheery words of appreciation, the father and son asked to speak to me alone. As soon as the door closed, both men became quite tearful. All that came out was, ""We want you to know how wrong we were.""
The second patient was an 85-year-old lady whose hair caught fire while she was smoking. She arrived with a deep burn; I knew it would surely be deadly. As a remarkable coincidence there was a meeting for discussion going on at the time in medical ethics . The speaker asked me if I had any sort of ethical problem I could bring up for discussion. I described the case and asked the students their opinion. After the discussion, I made a remark that was, when looking back, a serious mistake. I said, ""I'll take the word back to the nurses about her and we will talk about it some more before we decide."" The instructor and the students were shocked: ""You mean this is a real patient?"" The teacher of ethics was not accustomed to being challenged by actuality. In any event, I went back and met with the nurses. A day or two later, when she was making no progress and was suffering terribly, we began to back off treatment. Soon she died quietly and not in pain. As a reasonable physician, you had better move ahead and do what you would want done for you. And don't discuss it with the world first. There is a lesson here for everybody. Assisting people to leave this life requires strong judgment and long experience to avoid its misuse. 
 Question:The author suggested that doctors  _   before they assist a patient in killing himself. 
A. do what they are wanted to do 
B. discuss with the others about the decision first 
C. be required to do so first by the patient 
D. make sure there is no other choice left

Context: Janice is an American engineer working in Nanjing. She and her husband George, who is teaching English at a university, have been eager to get to know Chinese people better, so they were pleased when Liu, Janice's young co-worker, invited them to her home for dinner.
When they arrived, Liu introduced them to her husband Yang and asked them to sit down at a table containing eight plates of various cold dishes. Half an hour later she came back and sat down and the three began to eat. Yang came in from time to time, putting hot dishes on the table. Most of the food was wonderful, though neither George nor Janice could eat the fatty pork, and there was much more than they could eat. They kept wishing Yang would sit down so they could talk to him. Finally he did sit down to eat a bit, but soon it was time to go home.
Janice and George felt slightly depressed by this experience, but returned the invitation two weeks later. They decided to make a nice American meal and felt lucky to find olives, crackers , tomato juice, and even some cheese in the shop. They put these out as appetizers . For the main course they prepared spaghetti and a salad.
When Liu and Yang arrived and began to have dinner, they took small tastes of the appetizers and seemed surprised when both George and Janice sat down with them. They ate only a little spaghetti and didn't finish the salad on their plates. After a while, George cleared the table and served coffee and pastries . Yang and Liu each put four spoons of sugar into their coffee but didn't drink much of it and ate only a bite or two of pastry.
After they left, George and Janice were upset. "" We left their place so full but they're going to have to eat again when they get home. What went wrong?

Context: Once Dr. Mellinkoff invited me to join him at the hospital to discuss interesting cases(, ) with his  students.The case at hand was a Guatemalan man, aged 34, who had a fever and many other medical problems.His condition was not improving, and there was not much hope he would live.
Dr.: Mellinkoff asked to see the patient.He introduced himself in Spanish and, in a very gentle voice, asked how he felt.The patient smiled and said everything was all right.Then the doctor asked if he was able to eat.The patient said that he had no desire to eat.
""Are you getting food you like?""
The patient said nothing.
""Do you get the kind of food you have at home?""
The answer was no.
The doctor put his hand on the man's shoulder and his voice was very soft.
""If you had food that you liked, would you eat it?""
""Yes, yes,"" the patient said.
The change in the patient's appearance couldn't have been more obvious.Nothing was said, but it was easy to tell that a message had been sent and had also been received.
Later, the doctor asked why the Guatemalan man wasn't getting food he could eat.One of the students said, ""We all know how difficult it is to get the kitchen to make special meals.""
""Suppose,"" the doctor replied, ""you felt a certain medicine was absolutely necessary but that our hospital didn't carry it, would you accept defeat or would you insist the hospital meet your request?""
""I would probably insist,"" the student said.
""Very well,"" the doctor said.""You might want to try the same method in the kitchen.It won't be-easy, but I can help you.Meanwhile, let's get some food inside this man as fast as possible, and stay with it.Or he'll be killed by hunger.By the way, there must be someone among you who can speak Spanish.If we want to make real progress, we need to be able to talk with him.""
Three weeks later.Doctor Mellinkoff told me that the Guatemalan man had left the hospital under his own power.It takes more than medicine to help sick people; you also have to talk to them and make them comfortable. 
 Question:The patient had no desire to eat because   _  . 
A. he was not hungry

Context: Our listener question this week comes from Abdullahi Farah, who wants to know about the life and work of Doctor Benjamin Carson.
Doctor Carson is an internationally recognized doctor at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. He has been the director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at the hospital for twenty-five years. At the age of thirty-three, he became one of the youngest doctors in the United States to hold that position. And he was the first African-American to have that position at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
Ben Carson is known for his work as a brain surgeon for children. For example, in nineteen eighty-seven, he led a team of seventy doctors and nurses in an operation to separate two babies joined at the head. Earlier attempts by other
on other babies had failed. Doctor Carson successfully performed the operation. Both babies were able to survive independently.
Doctor Carson has written four books. His first book, ""Gifted Hands,"" tells the story of his life. Benjamin Carson was born in nineteen fifty-one in Detroit, Michigan.
As a boy, Ben was not a good student. In fact, he was the worst in his class. When his mother learned of his failing grades she asked her sons to read two library books every week. She limited the amount of time they watched television. And she told them to respect every person.
Ben Carson soon became the top student in his class. He went on to study at Yale University, one of the best universities in the country, and later to medical school at the University of Michigan.
Doctor Carson has received many awards and honors. Last year he received the nation's highest civilian honor. Former President George W. Bush presented Benjamin Carson with the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a ceremony at the White House.

There are many ways to celebrate this special month of graduation. You can have photos taken with your classmates and teachers, or dine out together and exchange gifts.

After the prom, teenagers either go to college or find a job. It means they are no longer as dependent on their parents as they were before.
At the prom, boys usually dress in dinner jackets and bow ties, though many different types of formal clothes are worn. Traditionally, girls give boys matching boutonnieres ( ). Girls traditionally wear formal dresses, or dress to shock or be noticed, in shiny or brightly colored materials.
Common prom activities include dining, dancing, the crowning   of a prom king and queen, and just talking to friends.  In some cases, high school students collect funds for their class prom through the four years of their high school.
High schools in or near large cities may rent ballrooms at expensive hotels or, to be unusual, in a pleasure cruise boat.

Context: For every woman who feels like she's had to scale back her personal ambitions since becoming a mother, gold medal cyclist Kristin Armstrong has a message: Don't give up on your dreams.
She retired after winning gold in Beijing to start a family; son Lucas arrived in 2010, but then she decided to compete again in the London Olympics. She won a gold medal at last.
The decision to start training again wasn't easy. ""I struggled with that a lot,"" she told a newspaper. ""At the beginning I felt selfish, I felt like, 'Well, I'm not supposed to be thinking of myself anymore. It's all supposed to be for my kid.'""
She faced physical challenges of getting back into competition shape after giving birth, as well. When she started racing in the spring of 2011, she was still breast-feeding; she would nurse her son, then race, then breast-feed again after the race. Her days revolved around Lucas and training.
""I feel like I'm able to do what I love to do and still manage a family and have that balance,"" Armstrong said. ""That you have a family or a child doesn't mean that you have to stop going after what you dream of individually.""
Armstrong makes balance look easy, whether it's on her bike or as an athlete-mom. But she points out that you can't have it all without making some sacrifices. For example, don't expect a neat home--her husband, Joe Savola, who she describes as her support system and her ""protector"", says he's had to give up on trying to keep everything orderly at home and just accept that their living room has become Lucas's playroom. For Armstrong, she's sacrificed time with friends who had kids around the same age--there just wasn't time.
Now, she says, ""That sounds like fun to me."" As she heads home to Boise, Idaho, she's ready to do regular mom stuff. 
 Question:In most days of 2011, Armstrong could be described as   _  . 
A. a housewife and a new mom 
B. an athlete and a career woman 
C. a parent and a sportswoman 
D. a wife and a good mother 
 Answer: C
Context: Mothers and daughters go through so much--yet when was the last time a mother and daughter sat down to write a book together about it all? Perri Klass and her mother, Sheila Solomon Klass, both gifted professional writers, prove to be ideal co-writers as they examine their decades of motherhood, daughterhood, and the wonderful ways their lives have overlapped  .
Perri notes with amazement how closely her own life has mirrored her mother's: both have full-time careers; both have published books, articles, and stories; each has three children; they both love to read. They also love to travel--in fact, they often take trips together. But in truth, the harder they look at their lives, the more they acknowledge their big differences in circumstance and basic nature.
A child of the Depression  , Sheila was raised in Brooklyn by parents who considered education a _ for girls. Starting with her college education, she has fought for everything she's ever accomplished. Perri, on the other hand, grew up privileged in the New Jersey suburbs of the 1960s and 1970s. For Sheila, wasting time or money is a crime, and luxury is unthinkable while Perri enjoys the occasional small luxury, but has not been successful at trying to persuade her mother into enjoying even the tiniest thing she likes.
Each writing in her own unmistakable voice, Perri and Sheila take turns exploring the joys and pains, the love and bitterness, the minor troubles and lasting respect that have always bonded them together. Sheila describes the adventure of giving birth to Perri in a tiny town in Trinidad where her husband was doing research fieldwork. Perri admits that she can't sort out all the mess in the households, even though she knows it drives her mother crazy. Together they compare thoughts on bringing up children and working, admit long-hidden sorrows, and enjoy precious memories.
Looking deep into the lives they have lived separately and together, Perri and Sheila tell their mother-daughter story with honesty, humor, enthusiasm, and admiration for each other. A written account in two voices, Every Mother Is a Daughter is a duet   that produces a deep, strong sound with the experiences that all mothers and daughters will recognize. 
 Question:How are women's lives explored in this book? 
A. In a musical form. 
B. Through field research. 
C. With unique writing skills. 
D. From different points of view.

Context: Whether it's a carol service or an evening of karaoke in the pub, many people will enjoy a good old singsong this Christmas. Singing aloud will not just lift the spirits---it's good for your physical health as well. Filling the lungs with air, increasing the heart rate and getting blood pumping round the body faster can all help our physical health.
For the past few years Heart Research UK has been Funding a Christmas campaign aimed at getting people singing, simply for the benefit it can bring. The organizer of the campaign says singing is a safe, simple and social activity that everyone can enjoy. ""Singing is linked to long life, stress reduction, and general health protection. It also brings a great amount of happiness. It is impossible to sing well with a long face because it affects your pitch .""
Professor Graham Welch, who leads the International Music Education Research Centre at the University of London, has spent more than 30 years studying the effects of singing. He says that singing is a form of exercise. It means we're also having a strong aerobic activity when we're singing, which results in increasing the feeling of pleasure while decreasing that of stress.
""And communal singing--like in a singing group, a church service or even a singsong in the pub--helps improve our sense of self-respect. It increases our sense of satisfaction with ourselves, a greater sense of feeling included. ""
Helen Astrid, a singing teacher, also sees the great effects that singing brings. ""It lifts us up on a spiritual level, it helps our self-respect, and it's great for all ages from small kids to grannies--you can have a good sing and _ .""

Context: Riding was the favourite activity of Thomas Jefferson, who was the third President of the United States. He usually rode good horses.
One day, he was riding outside Washington, when a jockey   came near. He did not know the President, but his professional eye was attracted by Mr. Jefferson's horse. He stopped and said that he wanted to buy the horse, but Mr. Jefferson politely refused his offer.
The jockey offered more money for the horse, because the closer he looked at the horse, the more he liked it. All of his offers were refused, which made him angry. He then became rude, but his rudeness left as little an impression as his money, for Jefferson had a very good temper. At last, he hit Mr. Jefferson's horse with his whip, getting it to run suddenly. This would have thrown a less skillful rider to the ground, but Jefferson stayed on his seat, and controlled his horse well.
The jockey then gave up. He rode with Mr. Jefferson side by side and began to talk with him about politics. Jefferson joined in the conversation. When they got into the city and came close to the gate of the presidential mansion  , Mr. Jefferson stopped, and politely invited the man to enter.
The jockey was surprised and asked, ""Why? Do you live here?""
""Yes"" was the simple reply.
""Why, stranger, what's your name?""
""My name is Thomas Jefferson.""
Embarrassed, the man quickly left, while the President looked at him with a smile and then rode through the gate.

B. Mr. Jefferson was very good at riding a horse 
C. Mr. Jefferson would invite the jockey to his own house later

Context: In my mind, there is a moving story about a skinny young boy who loved football with all his heart.
Practice after practice, he eagerly gave everything he had. But being half the size of the other boys,he got  ly nowhere. Despite his hard training at all the games, this hopeful athlete sat on the bench and hardly ever played.
This teenager lived alone with his father, and the relationship between the two of them was very special. Even though the son was always on the bench, his father was always in the stands cheering. He never missed a game. This young man was still the smallest of the class when he entered high school. But his father continued to encourage him.
The young man loved football and was determined to try his best at every practice, and perhaps he'd get to play when he became a senior. All through high school he never missed a practice nor a game but remained a benchwarmer. Besides, his faithful father was always in the stands, always with words of encouragement for him. When the young man went to college, he decided to try out for the football team as a""walk-on"". Everyone firmly believed that he could never make the cut, but he did.
The news that he had survived the cut thrilled him so much that he rushed to the nearest phone and called his father. His father shared his excitement and was sent season tickets for all the college games. This persistent young athlete never missed practice during his four years at college, butactually he never got the real chance to play in a game.
It was at the end of his senior football season that the coach met him with a telegram. The young man read the telegram and he became totally silent. Swallowing hard, he mumbled to the coach,""My father died this morning. Is it all right if I miss practice today?""The coach put his arm gently around his shoulder and said,""Take the rest of the week off, son. And don't even plan to come back to the game on Saturday.""
Saturday arrived, and the game was not going well. In the third quarter, when the team was ten points behind, a silent young man quietly slipped into the empty locker room and put on his football gear. As he ran onto the sidelines , the coach and his players were surprised to see their faithful teammate back so soon.""Coach, please let me play. I've just got to play today,""said the young man. The coach pretended not to hear him. There was no way he wanted his worst player in this close play-off game. But the young man insisted, and finally feeling sorry for the kid, the coach gave in.""All right,""he said.""You can go in.""Before long, the coach, the players and everyone in the stands could not believe their eyes. This little unknown, who had never played before, was doing everything right. The opposing team could not stop him. He ran, passed, blocked, and tackled like a star. His team began to succeed. The score was soon tied. In the closing seconds of the game, this kid got a pass and ran all the way for the winning touchdown.
Finally, after the stands had emptied, the coach noticed that this young man was sitting quietly in the corner all alone. The coach came to him and said,""Kid, you were unbelievably fantastic! Tell me what got into you? How did you do it?""
He looked at the coach, tears in his eyes, and said,""Well, you knew my dad died, but did you know that my dad was blind?""The young man swallowed hard and forced a smile,""Dad came to all my games, but today was the first time he could see me play, and I wanted to show him I could make it!"" 
 Question:From the passage, we can infer that   . 
A. the young man's coach played an important role in his growth 
B. the young man's father had a great positive influence on him 
C. not until his father passed away did the young man train hard 
D. the young man's road to success in football was always smooth 
 Answer: B
Context: Robert had just moved into the street and he felt strange that he was not wanted. He knew that perhaps the other boy students were trying to get an idea of what kind of a boy he was. This did not help to make him less lonely. He was new and he had to be tested. Still, proving himself would not be all that easy. He did not want to run with bad boys or get into something against the law to prove that he was strong. No! He must show what he was made of in a more helpful way. That would be better when he got the idea.
The next day was Saturday. He knew that most of the boys would be down on the playground and choose up sides for the Saturday game. Robert knew he could play well and that just might be enough to prove he was strong and to make friends with them. He arrived early and did his step exercises.

Context: Alice always wanted to be a singer. Music was the most important thing in her life, but to tell you the truth, she took lessons for years, practiced every day, but in spite of all this, her voice didn't improve. Honestly, it didn't get better, it just got louder.

The teacher was very worried about what to say after the performance. She knew it would be terrible and it was. She didn't want to tell a lie, but she didn't want to hurt Alice's feelings either. Finally, she got an idea and went backstage   to greet her former pupil.
""Well,"" said Alice, ""what did you think of my performance?""
""My dear,"" said the teacher, ""you'll never be better than you were tonight."" 
 Question:Why did Alice want to be a singer? 
A. Because she was good at singing. 
B. Because she could do nothing but sing. 
C. Because she had a good teacher. 
D. Because she was most interested in music.

Context: Undoubtedly there are a few positive characters who are able to ""rise above"" their environment, who are able to impress the people with whom they come in contact in spite of their clothes.
Sometimes we read of some learned woman, who has ""made good in her profession,"" who says that she has not looked in a mirror for years; but such a woman is a rare exception, and one is not safe in gambling  with one's chances of success by following her. It is not the positive characters with whom we are concerned, however, for they are few and somehow manage to take care of themselves. The vast majority of the race are not so blessed, and we need to observe but little to realize that with them the reaction of clothes is an important factor.
School girls should know that clothes may make a career; happiness and leadership in all the years of high school and college life may be affected by the story a Freshman's clothes tell. Many a girl with a keen mind, who has a natural disregard for clothes, perhaps, or who has not been trained in the appreciation of beauty in clothes, has lost her opportunities for leadership and self-expression which by right her brain power should have given her.
One of the mental capacities which we all exercise and yet exercise most unconsciously is that of passing judgment on the people we meet. In a majority of cases the judgment is superficial  and inaccurate; but the estimate is made. Some people may not get their final judgment till they hear one talk and will judge one by the tone of voice and by what is said as the true index; but the vast majority will form an opinion based largely, if not entirely, on appearance.

Context: Most people at some time or another have dreamed of being a popular kid at school. Being popular in middle school is much easier than it sounds. Just follow a few steps and finally see what it feels like to be a popular kid.
First, why do you want to be popular? Ask yourself if your desire  for being popular comes from looking down on yourself or an unlucky situation. If it does, then work first on your self-confidence.
Be friendly to everyone, even people that other people think are _ or different. If you are strange or different, realize that everyone is strange in their own way. Take part in school activities and make yourself more visible( ) to the school population.
Find a talent or special skill that you have. Whether your skill is telling jokes, drawing, singing or playing soccer, show your skill in right way.
Volunteer to help with classroom or school activities that will help you leave a good impression  on teachers. Develop a personal style that you feel goes well with your personality.
Be yourself and have fun. Keep your strong sense and personality. Join school clubs, sporting teams and student government to show yourself as someone who makes a difference at your school . 
 Question:The writer writes the passage to tell us  _  . 
A. what to do in high school 
B. how to get along well with others 
C. how to become popular in middle school 
D. what kinds of students are popular at school 
 Answer: C
Context: Surviving the boredom of a school day can be bad enough, but when you have to worry about school gangs as well it's enough to make any student want to stay at home and under the covers! Unfortunately, gang culture can be found in many British schools, and it brings with it negative, and dangerous, side effects. The presence of weapons at or near school, the appearance of graffiti on buildings and lockers, and pressure to blow off school work and exams all follow where the gangs lead. None of these things contribute to a good education, but for school gangs that's exactly the point - school is for being popular and having fun, not learning anything or preparing for the future. Keep these tips in mind and say goodbye to school gangs.
Know your own mind. Often it is those with low self-esteem and a poor self-image who become victims of school gangs. These students don't know their own mind or have a clear picture of what they would like to do in the future, so it is easy to be influenced by those who don't want to do any work today.
Keep yourself busy. School gangs often hang around at or near schools with no real reason. Students who have nothing scheduled can easily be sucked into these groups, but if you are busy, busy, busy and always on the move there will be less chance that you'll have the time to stay and ""play"".
Choose your friends wisely. With a core group of like-minded friends, it is much easier to stay away from school gangs because you simply don't need them. Remember that gangs are a source of power for members, but they can also be a source of intimidation.
Work hard and have fun. No one likes a teacher's pet, but school gangs in particular hate them. Work hard and have fun at school, but don't annoy anyone with extreme goody-two-shoes  behaviour. School gangs can be a nightmare if you must deal with them constantly. Stay away from gang hangouts and gang members, and don't involve yourself in any gang related activities. 
 Question:What can be inferred from the passage? 
A. Those who focus on study are more likely to stay away from school gangs. 
B. Whoever knows what he will do in the future can be influenced by school gangs. 
C. Having a lot to do, you have no chance of getting in touch with school gangs. 
D. Without good friends, you are sure to end up with school gangs. 
 Answer: A
Context: First lady Michelle Obama has some advice for some Tennessee High School graduates: Strike your own path in college and life and work to overcome inevitable difficulties with determination and courage.
The first lady told the 170 graduates that she spent too much of her own time in college focusing on academic achievements. While her success in college and law school led to a high-profile  job, she said, she ended up leaving to focus on public service.
""My message to all of you today is this: Do not waste a minute living someone else's dream,""she said. ""It takes a lot of real work to discover what brings you joy... and you won't find what you love simply by checking boxes or padding your GPA .""
She said the school reminded her of her own high school experience in Chicago. ""My No. 1 goal was to go to a high school that would push me and challenge me,"" she said. ""I wanted to go somewhere that would celebrate achievement. A place where academic success wouldn't make me a target of teasing or bullying, but instead would be a badge of honour."" But Mrs. Obama said pitifully that not all students have the same opportunities. ""Unfortunately, schools like this don't exist for every kid,"" she said. ""You are lucky.""
The first lady told graduates that failure may be a part of their college lives and careers, and that how they respond to any difficulties will define them. ""That's when you find out what you're really made of in those hard times,"" she said. ""But you only do that if you're willing to put yourself a position where you might fall.""
Overcoming difficulties has been the hallmark  of many great people, she said. ""There's this guy Barack Obama... he lost his first race for Congress, and now he gets to call himself my husband."" The first lady joked: ""I could take up a whole afternoon talking about his failures."" 
 Question:By talking about her academic achievements, Michelle wanted to   _  . 
A. show off her great success in college 
B. be the example for the students 
C. warn that it's not enough to study well 
D. encourage the students to focus on study

Context: Donald was shaken by thunder on the bed before he could count ""one thousand one"". Then he heard the smoke alarm go off. He went downstairs quickly to investigate. When he opened the door to the basement  , flames exploded out.
Donald fled   back upstairs to call 911 but the phone didn't work. When he tried to go downstairs, he was stopped by a wall of flames. He had to use a towel to cover his mouth.

Context: When Alexandra Holderman of Indiana was five years old, she saw a bay dressed in only a T-shirt, diaper , and blanket in the middle of winter. Alexandra could tell that the baby was very cold. ""He had red, chapped  skin and a runny nose,"" she remembers.
That same year, Alexandra started Baby Bundles  , a program to help mothers keep their babies warm. She packed bundles of pajamas, blankets, diapers, bottles and bibs, and then delivered them to centers for women who couldn't afford the items. Alexandra continues this program today.
Where does Alexandra get the money for her program? The first year, family members helped a lot. Many of them gave Alexandra money to buy supplies. Alexandra's mother, who has always encouraged Alexandra to share her blessings with people who are less fortunate, taught her how to request donations from stores.
Alexandra felt shy speaking with stores' business managers at first. ""But now it just comes naturally,"" she says, ""and I have places that donate stuff every year."" Alexandra has been doing Baby Bundles for six years now. Each September she writes betters to stores asking for supplies and donations. Then she makes follow-up phone calls. In October, she gathers all of the donations and goes shopping. One of the biggest challenges is getting all of the supplies she needs while staying within a planned budget.
     Alexandra has had to give up her allowance and some time with friends, but she knows that what she's doing helps. Sometimes she sees a baby wearing clothes like the ones she put in her bundles. And she wonders if that baby was helped by her program. ""I know that there are babies out there who are warmer and healthier now,"" she says.
Alexandra plans to continue Baby Bundles as long as she can and is currently trying to get a Web site set up. She hopes that her work will inspire other young people to find ways to serve their communities. Alexandra has made sure that many babies in Indiana remain cozy during the winter months.     DCAC 
 Question:The following things except   _   may be included in Alexandra's Baby Bundles. 
A. baby clothes 
B. diapers 
C. baby caps

Context: The statistics I've cited and the living examples are all too familiar to you. But what may not be so familiar will be the increasing number of women who are looking actively for advancement of for a new job in your offices. This woman may be equipped with professional skills and perhaps valuable experience.

She is the symbol of what I call the Second Wave of Feminism. She is the modern woman who is determined to be.
Her forerunner was the radical feminist who interpreted her trapped position as a female as oppression by the master class of men. Men, she believed, had created a domestic, servile role for women in order that men could have the career and the opportunity to participate in making the great decisions of society. Thus the radical feminist held that women through history had been oppressed and dehumanized, mainly because man chose to exploit his wife and the mother of his children. Sometimes it was deliberate exploitation and sometimes it was the innocence of never looking beneath the pretensions of life.
The radical feminists found strength in banding together. Coming to recognize each other for the first time, they could explore their own identities, realize their own power, and view the male and his system as the common enemy. The first phases of feminism in the last five years often took on this militant, class-warfare tone. Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, Germaine Greer, and many others hammered home their ideas with a persistence that aroused and intrigued many of the brightest and most able women in the country. Consciousness-raising groups allowed women to explore both their identities and their dreams--and the two were often found in direct conflict.
What is the stereotyped role of American women? Marriage. A son. Two daughters. Breakfast. Ironing. Lunch. Bowling, maybe a garden club of for the very daring, non-credit courses in ceramics. Perhaps an occasional cocktail party. Dinner. Football or baseball on TV. Each day the same. Never any growth in expectations--unless it is growth because the husband has succeeded. The inevitable question: ""Is that all there is to life?""
The rapid growth of many feminist organizations attests to the fact that these radical feminists had touched some vital nerves. The magazine ""Ms."" was born in the year of the death of the magazine ""Life."" But too often the consciousness-raising sessions became ends in themselves. Too often sexism reversed itself and man-hating was encouraged. Many had been with the male chauvinist.
It is not difficult, therefore, to detect a trend toward moderation. Consciousness-raising increasingly is regarded as a means to independence and fulfillment, rather than a ceremony of fulfillment itself. Genuine independence can be realized through competence, through finding a career, through the use of education. Remember that for many decades the education of women was not supposed to be useful. 
 Question:What does the word ""militant"" mean? 
A. Aggressive. 
B. Ambitions. 
C. Progressive. 
D. Independent. 
 Answer: A
Context: Sex prejudices are based on and justified by the ideology  that biology is destiny. According to this ideology, basic biological and psychological differences exist between the sexes. These differences require each sex to play a separate role in social life. Women are the weaker sex both physically and emotionally. Thus, they are naturally suited, much more so than men, to the performance of domestic  duties. A woman's place, under normal circumstances, is within the protective environment of the home. Nature has determined that women play caretaker roles, such as wife and mother and homemaker. On the other hand, men are best suited to go out into the competitive world of work and politics, where serious responsibilities must be taken on. Men are to be the providers; women and children are ""dependents"".
The ideology also holds that women who wish to work outside the household should naturally fill these jobs that are in line with the special capabilities of their sex. It is appropriate for women, not men, to be employed as nurses, social workers, elementary school teachers, house-hold helpers, clerks and secretaries. These positions are simply an extension of women's domestic role. Informal distinctions between ""women's work"" and ""men's work"" in the labor force, according to the ideology, are simply a functional reflection of the basic differences between the sexes.
Finally, the ideology suggests that nature has worked her will in another significant way. For the human species to survive over time, its members must regularly reproduce. Thus, women must, whether at home or in the labor force, make the most of their physical appearances.
So goes the ideology. It is, of course, not true that basic biological and psychological differences between the sexes require each to play sex-defined roles in social life. There is enough evidence that sex roles vary from society to society, and _ 
But to the degree people actually believe that biology is destiny and that nature intended for men and women to make different contributions to society, sex-defined roles will be seen as totally acceptable. 
 Question:According to the biology-is-destiny ideology, women  _  . 
A. cannot compete with men in any field 
B. are suited more to domestic jobs than men 
C. are sensitive enough to be a good caretaker 
D. are too weak to do any agricultural work at all 
 Answer: B
Context: Pride and Prejudice for the Modern Woman
Let us imagine how Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen's most famous work, might be updated, 200 years on.
Austen's popularity is rooted in her intelligence. But today she would certainly have had a very different life, as would her characters. Here's my own suggestion. . .
It is a truth finally and universally acknowledged that a single woman with brains deserves to have equal opportunities to men, however disadvantaged she may feel by sexism.
"" My dear husband,"" said his hopeful wife one day, "" have you heard that the local store, standing empty for so long, is taken over by a bright young businesswoman?""
Her dull and indifferent   husband replied that he had not. ""But it is, it is,"" she replied excitedly. Mr Dull-Husband made no reply.
""Don't you want to know her plans?"" she cried with some impatience.
""Well, clearly you think it matters to your silly little head. .. so I'd better listen. ""
""Well, my dear, the rumour   is that she has already set up a string of successful businesses in northern England, though _ She will move in herself next month. "" ""What is her name?"" ""Bingley. ""
""Is she married or single?""
""What a question! And none of your business. But her coming will be a fine thing for our five boys. "" ""How so? How can it possibly affect them? ""
""My dear love; those lazy boys need something to wake them up. There are bound to be jobs going. ""
"" Is that her point in settling here? Surely as a woman she has simply taken a fancy to the place. ""
"" Nonsense, my love, how little you've noticed the world has changed. She's got a first-rate degree and some sort of business qualification, I'm told. She surely needs one of our boys! Perhaps you might give her a call. ""
"" Me? No. Perhaps you can take an interest. You still have your looks, after all. She may even offer you a job. "" ""Oh, that's not likely. These new chances belong to the younger generation. But now you mention it, I think I'll go along all the same. ""
And Mrs Bennet went along. That was 10 years ago. She is now managing director of a FTSE-listed company.
... It would remain the case, of course, that Mrs Bennet would be one of very few women on the company board, that her salary would be lower than her male colleagues, her bonus of a more ""female"" dimension and her lifespan   among the city's business leaders shorter than theirs. Still, she'd no doubt have enjoyed Davos--and might even have hobnobbed   with influential figures. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? 
A. Austen was born 200 years ago. 
B. Austen rewrote Pride and Prejudice. 
C. Austen's success lies in her wisdom. 
D. Austen's updated work gains popularity. 
 Answer: C
Context: In Jane Austin's time, unmarried girls were always closely guarded, and hardly allowed to be alone with a young man; and during the Victorian period (just the period after Jane Austin) exposure  of the body in particular was thought to be most immoral, Victorian ladies wore dresses reaching down to their feet, long in the sleeve and high at the neck. Since then, ways of dressing as well as times have changed. Girls were no longer guarded, and they can do more or less what they like. And yet among all these astonishing changes, one thing has remained much the same for most people, and that is the same of becoming a mother before being married. If this does happen, there often comes a quick marriage with the responsible man. If this is impossible, the affair may bring considerable shame to the girl's parents as well as to herself.
   It is now quite normal for a girl, once past the age of about fifteen, to go out with a boyfriend, and although her parents will probably insist that she come home at a certain time, beyond this they depend on her or look after herself. Kisses between young men and women are now considered to be perfectly normal, but although times have changed so much, most people still believe that a woman should not become a mother before being married. 
 Question:The main idea of this article is that   _  . 
A. a girl should not become a mother before being married. 
B. girls are no longer closely guarded. 
C. ways of dressing have changed with the time.

1823,"Definition: Given a reading comprehension type question-answering from an english exam for school students. You are given a context and multiple choice question containing four options ""A."", ""B."", ""C."" and ""D."". The question is answerable from the comprehension. Based on the question, the option and the context select the most appropriate answer from the provided choices ""A."", ""B."", ""C."" and ""D."".
Context: Many women write to me perplexed  about why they can't form close friendships.They try new approaches,put themselves in all the right places,see therapists,and read relevant selfhelp books.They consider themselves interesting,loyal,kind,and friendworthy people.But for reasons unknown to them,they have a tough time forming intimate relationships.Many admit to not having even one close friend.
A recent study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology offers some clues as to how both nature(personality) and nurture (experience) impact our friendships.Researchers at the University of Virginia and University of Toronto,Mississauga studied more than 7,000 American adults between the ages of 20 and 75 over a period of ten years,looking at the number of times these adults moved during childhood.Their study,like prior ones,showed a link between residential mobility and adult wellbeing:The more  times participants moved as children,the poorer the quality of their adult social relationships.
But digging deeper,the researchers found that personality--specifically being introverted   or extroverted  --could either intensify or buffer   the effect of moving to a new town or neighborhood during childhood.The negative impact of more moves during childhood was far greater for introverts compared to extroverts.
""Moving a lot makes it difficult for people to maintain longterm close relationships,"" stated Dr.Shigehiro Oishi,the first author of the study,in a press release from the American Psychological Association,""This might not be a serious problem for outgoing people who can make friends quickly and easily.Less outgoing people have a harder time making new friends.""
Families often have to relocate--across town,across the country,or across the globe.Yet,in many cases,their kids and young adolescents haven't yet built up a bank of friendships.So the conventional wisdom is to try to minimize moves for the sake of your child,whenever possible,and to move at the end of the academic year. 
 Question:In order for children to maintain longterm close relationships,parents   _  . 
A. should not relocate their homes 
B. should relocate their homes within the town 
C. had better move at the end of the school year 
D. had better move when their children couldn't build up a bank of friendships

Context: Jascha Richter once sang ""don't need too much talking without saying anything"" to reveal his lonely feeling in a crowd.
Dad always told me never to ever reveal my true opinions towards other people if such opinions are negative. He said this is the ""Chu Shi Zhe Xue"", the philosophy of dealing with social network.
It seems that everybody here just follows this philosophy very, very well.
Friends. I would say that if I were given true friendship I would definitely treasure it with my greatest care. If I really regard someone as my close friend, I would never leave her alone whenever she's in need, either financially or mentally. And I always believe, as long as I treat people with whole-hearted honesty, I would have some rewards--at least, just ONE true friend of the same gender .
Sometimes I just miss my friends in China. Perhaps when we became friends, we were still young, too young to have been polluted by any dirt in the society. But here, it is simply different. It seems that all of us have learnt how to SURVIVE in a foreign land and such an experience actually makes us learn how to extract   the most benefits from the surroundings in order to survive.
All are friends around me. I've looked through all the dark sides of their personalities and yet I have to pretend that I know nothing. THEY ARE GOOD. THEY ARE GOOD. AND WE ARE FRIENDS. And then I can make myself comfortable enough to talk to people I hate the most. And of course, they don't say any words truly from their hearts. Neither do I.
But, sometimes I just feel unwilling to talk to these people. Sometimes, I just want to be alone, quietly, without being forced to listen to their gossip or other useless words.
""Standing on a mountain high
Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky
I should go and see some friends
But they don't really comprehend""
Jascha Richter expresses my feelings also.

Context: I'm not so sure I like my friends any more. I used to like them-to be honest. We'd have lunch, talk on the phone or exchange emails, and they all seemed normal enough. But then came Face Book, and I was introduced to a sad fact: many of my friends have dark sides that they had kept from me.
Today my friends show off the more unpleasant aspects of their personalities via FaceBook. No longer hidden, they're thrown in my face like TV commercials -unavoidable and endless advertisements for the worst of their personalities.
Take Fred. If you were to have lunch with him, you'd find him warm, and self-effacing .Read his FaceBook and you'll realize he's an unbearable, food-obsessed boring man. He'd pause to have a cup of coffee on his way to save a drowning man-and then write about it.
Take Andy. You won't find a smarter CEO anywhere, but now he's a CEO without a company to run. So he plays Mafia Wars on FaceBook. He's doing well-level 731. Thanks to FaceBook, I know he's playing about 18 hours a day. Andy, you've run four companies-and this is how you spend your downtime? What happned to golf?What happened to getting another job?
Take Liz. She is positive that the flu vaccine will kill us all and that we should avoid it. And then comes Chris who likes to post at least 20 times a day on every website he can find, so I get to read his thoughts twice, once on FaceBook and once on Twitter.
In real life, I don't see these sides of people. Face to face, my friends show me their best. They're nice, smart people. But face to FaceBook, my friends is like a blind date which goes horribly wrong.
I'm left with a dilemma. Who is my real friend?Is it the Liz I have lunch with or the anti-vaccine madman on FaceBook? Is it the Fred I can grab a sandwich with or the Fred who weeps if he's at a party and the wine isn't up to his standard? 
 Question:According to the text, FaceBook tends to   _  . 
A. present another side of people 
B. offer some foods for free 
C. show endless advertisements 
D. get you to more parties

Context: At the age of sixteen,I joined a volunteer group with my dad. I went on my first volunteer project in West Virginia. On the night we arrived, we discovered that ""our family"" was living in a trailer  that was in poor condition. A crew had been working on it for two weeks,but every time they finished one problem,another surfaced(, ). 
We decided the only reasonable solution was to build a new house--something unusual but necessary under these circumstances. The family was overjoyed with their new house that was twenty by thirty feet with three bedrooms,a bath and a kitchen. 
On Tuesday of that week, while we were eating lunch together,I asked the family's three boys,Josh,Eric and Ryan,""What do you want for your new room?""Expecting toys and other gadgets that children usually ask for, we were astonished when Josh responded,""I just want a bed.""
The boys had never slept in a bed! They were accustomed to plastic mats. That night we had a meeting and decided that beds would be the perfect gift. On Thursday night, a few adults in our group drove to the nearest city and bought beds and new bedding. 
When we saw the delivery truck coming,we told the family about the surprise. We could hardly control ourselves. It was like watching excited children on Christmas morning. 
That afternoon, as we fitted the frames of the beds together, Eric ran into the house to watch us. Too dirty to enter his room,he observed with wideeyed enthusiasm from the doorway. 
As my father slipped a pillowcase  onto one of the pillows,Eric asked,""What is that?""
""A pillow,"" he replied. 
""What do you do with it?"" Eric continued to ask. 
""When you go to sleep,you put your head on it,"" I answered softly. Tears came to my eyes as my father handed Eric the pillow. 
""Oh...that's soft,"" he said,hugging it tightly. 
Now,when my sister or I start to ask for something that seems urgent,my dad gently asks,  ""Doyouhaveapillow?""
We know exactly what he means. 
 Question:From the passage,  we can learn that Eric had never seen  _   before. 
A. a trailer 
B. a truck 
C. a pillow 
D. a house

Context: I spent my last vacation trekking  in Nepal, a small country in the Himalaya Mountains of Asia. On a trekking vacation, you walk for long distances through the mountains.

Our guide even cooked our food for us. Every day, we trekked for about four hours before lunch, and about two hours in the afternoon. At the end of the day's trek, we sat around a campfire and talked about the things we saw. Then we went to sleep in large tents. Every morning, our guide brought breakfast to our tent. It was great. At the end of the trip, I didn't want to go home! 
 Question:Where did they sleep? 
A. In a hotel. 
B. In the tents.

Context: Do you still get free plastic bags  from the supermarket ? Things will change soon.
To protect  the environment, supermarkets in China will stop providing   free plastic bags after June 1st. If you don't want to pay money to buy them, you'll have to bring your own shopping bag.
What kind of bags will be the best to bring? Students in Kunming Xinying Middle School have some good ideas.
Recently 54 students of the school held an activity in which they made their own environmentally-friendly shopping bags.
Most students used old clothes to make their bags. They painted pictures like the Olympic rings on them.
But Wang Shuncheng, a Junior 2 boy, chose a different material  . He made his bag with old newspaper. Is a newspaper bag strong enough to hold shopping? Wang says it is, ""No problem. I put six bottles of water in the bag,"" he said. ""It's strong enough!""
Chen Lisi, a girl, had a more traditional way to make her bag - she weaved   a bamboo basket. It was not an easy job. With her grandfather's help, Chen spent a whole afternoon making it. She also weaved wool   flowers on the basket.
Making bags was not all the students did. They had another job: to persuade their parents and relatives to use environmentally-friendly shopping bags instead of plastic ones. The school will show the bags so that shops and stores can get inspiration   from the students' work. 
 Question:Supermarkets in China stop providing plastic bags because   _  . 
A. they want to save money 
B. markets want to make more money 
C. plastic bags are very expensive 
D. they want to protect the environment

Context: A TV program was being videoed. Tonight it was to select the sweetest whisper of love ever said between husband and wife.
The final competition was held among 10 married couples. Seven of them were young ones, two middle-aged and one old. The last turn came to the old couple. The old lady took the microphone and said the sweetest whisper of love she had ever heard was: "" Are you standing or sitting?""
The host fixed his eyes on her, quite puzzled by her words.
Regardless of all the talking around, she went on with her story. Her husband had been a doctor before he retired. One day when he was on duty at the hospital, he felt a sharp pain at the heart. By his professional knowledge he knew immediately he suffered a fit of heart attack. His colleagues carried him at once to the operation room and prepared  him for a bypass operation, which was highly risky. The patient's family members had to be informed before it began. The patient himself was allowed to put in a word. Lying silently on the operation table with a trembling hand, he dialed after a moment's thinking of the number of his wife's phone. Finally a familiar voice came from the other end...
""So many years had passed but memory of this incident remained fresh in my mind. What he said in the beginning was: 'Are you standing or sitting?' He was actually worried about me, wondering how I felt at the news. He was afraid I would have fallen flat onto the ground. In such a critical  state as he was then, his thought still went to me..."" The old lady concluded slowly, ""That's the sweetest whisper of love I've ever heard all my life.""
A loud applause followed in the wake of a short silence. 
 Question:which of the following might be the best title for the text? 
A. Are You Standing or Sitting. 
B. True Love Needn't Words. 
C. A Moving TV Program. 
D. An Old Couple's Love Story. 
 Answer: A
Context: He leant down to the pickpocket. The heaving and gasping had stopped, but he was still making a show of his breathlessness.
""That's better,"" Mallon said. ""Can you stand up? Try to stand up. Here,"" he said, and gripped the pickpocket's arm and forced him upright until he saw his face for the first time. As the pickpocket labored for breath, he gazed up at Mallon with his dark eyes. ""How could you?"" they asked.
Mallon might have said, ""Because you tried to steal from me."" But he was still conscious of the flush of joy he'd felt when his blow struck home -- when he knew he'd hurt the man. Where that joy came from he couldn't say, but he knew that its roots were deeper than some clumsy failed theft.
Fat drops of rain began to patter on the awning  .
""How are you?"" Mallon said. ""Can you walk?"" The pickpocket turned away and leant against the store window with both hands, and his head sank lower as his shoulders rose and fell. A gray-haired woman inside the store rapped on the glass and made a shooing motion. When the pickpocket ignored her, she rapped harder and kept rapping.
""I have to go,"" Mallon said. ""I'm sorry."" He looked up at the sky. ""I'm sorry,"" he said again, and stepped into the rain and walked quickly up the street.
One of the Bangladeshi umbrella sellers was working the corner, and Mallon had just paid seven euros when he heard a woman shouting. He didn't want to look back but did. It was the woman from the shop, pushing and batting the pickpocket away from the window while he bent down and covered his head like a boxer trying to get through the last seconds of a round. Mallon slipped his wallet back into his jacket pocket and took the umbrella that the Bangladeshi had opened for him.
The pickpocket was out on the sidewalk now, in the rain. The woman stood just under the awning with her arms crossed over her chest.
""Excuse me, madam,"" Mallon said, coming up to them. ""This man isn't well. He needs to rest a moment.""
""I know these people,"" she said. ""Our Romans don't want them here.""
The rain fell in sheets, ran down the pickpocket's shiny scalp and face, down his leather jacket.
""Here,"" Mallon said, and offered him the umbrella, but he only looked at Mallon with his hurt dark eyes and then lowered his head again. Mallon bumped him in the shoulder with the handle of the umbrella. ""Go on -- take it!"" he said. And finally, with a beaten, unwilling look, the pickpocket did.
And that was when he saw a taxi round the corner with a light glowing on its roof. Mallon ran out waving his arm and the cab turned sharply to the pavement, sending a lot of water over his shoes. He opened the door but couldn't help looking back. The pickpocket had lowered the umbrella to the ground upside down and was leaning on the shaft, head low, neck bared to the sky.
""Wait,"" Mallon said to the driver. He went back and grabbed the pickpocket's sleeve and pulled him to the cab. ""Get in,"" Mallon said, and took the umbrella and pushed him into the back seat. He leaned inside. ""O.K., where do you live?""
""No Gypsies!"" the driver said. He was twisted around, glaring at the pickpocket.
""Gypsy? Look, he's not well. I'll pay,"" Mallon added.
The driver shook his head. ""No Gypsies. Get him out,""
Mallon looked at the driver's nameplate: Michele Kadare. ""It's the law,"" he said, ""If you don't take us, Signor Kadare, I'll report you and you'll lose your license. Believe me -- I am quite serious.""
The driver fastened those pale eyes on Mallon and turned and put his hands on the steering wheel. He raised his eyes to the rearview mirror and he and Mallon exchanged stares.
""O.K., Mr. American,"" he said. ""You pay."" 
 Question:Where should the sentence ""He hesitated, then turned back."" be placed? 
A. Between paragraphs 5 and 6.

Context: A boy and a girl were a couple of lovers. The girl liked feeling rain, so the boy was always holding the umbrella when it rained and most part of the umbrella was over the girl. Rain showered the boy every time but he said nothing except looked at the gift's face, which was full of silent satisfaction. He felt very happy, so did the girl.
One day they went out for a walk. They were walking hand in hand passing a building which was under construction. The girl jumped with excitement and said something. The boy seldom talked only feeling excited as she felt looking at her silently. When the girl was talking, a not big or small stone fell down from the building toward the girl's head! At that moment the boy took the girl in his arms so suddenly and so strongly that the girl let out a scream. He meant to protect the gift with his body. But the boy turned over to make his own body downward before they dropped on the ground. As a result, only the girl's hand was smashed by the stone and _ 
The girl came back to earth and cried with pain, tears weeping up. She thought the saying that ""The husband and the wife are birds in the same forest essentially, but when serious tragedy comes, they will fly separately"" was really not wrong! With this, she straggled and stood up from. the boy's body keeping from the pains and slowly ran away without glancing at the boy.
At the time, the boy was calling the girl's name in a weak voice, his lips were already white. He took out his mobile phone and dialed the girl's number, but the girl didn't answer. He dialed again she didn't answer again. For several times, he gave up. But his fingers pressed something on the mobile. At that time, beside the boy, the blood spread slowly, his hand hung and the mobile phone lay in the blood, he had no strength to press the ""SENT"" key yet.
The next day, when the girl heard of the news that the boy was being rescued, she ran to the hospital without considering her anger. When she hurried to the hospital, the doctor had already declared his death; the cause of his death was that his lung had lost too much blood.
It was because, when the boy meant to protect the girl with his body he found that there was a steel stick under them, so he turned over to make it inset(=""put"" into) his own body.
The boy's mother passed the boy's mobile phone on to the gift.
The girl read the message that hadn't been sent: ""Honey, I'm sorry, I still couldn't protect you and made you wound... ""Upon this, the girl couldn't help crying...
Please treasure the one you love and believe his or her LOVE!

However, as we all know, life does not work that way and sometimes we get a wake-up call that shocks us and makes us stand back and realize how short life is.
To cheer her up, I tried to imagine if I were in her shoes how I would feel. It was impossible to imagine what she was going through. What words could I say to help her?Sometimes words just can't express our feelings. Sometimes our actions are much more meaningful than words. So I gave her a hug ...
Life is too short, and we should treasure  every day staying with our loved ones. 
 Question:In the writer's opinion, life for us is   _  .

 Answer: A
Context: Linda was kind of late. Linda, 25, had a lot to do at work, plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Linda felt weak and tired -- maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks.
Several yards away, Frank, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying.
But when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, ""Oh, my God, she fell in!""Frank didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. ""No ! Not you ! ""his girlfriend screamed after him.
She was right to be alarmed. By the time Frank reached Linda, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station.
It was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the arms and drag her away from the edge. That was where Linda briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse.
Linda thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in.
Police and fire officials soon arrived, and Frank told the story to an officer. Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40minute train ride downtown--just as he had been seconds after the rescue, which made her think about her reaction at the time. ""I saw the train coming and I was thinking he was going to die, "" she explained. 
 Question:How did Frank save Linda? 
A. By helping her rise to her feet. 
B. By lifting her to the platform. 
C. By pulling her along the ground. 
D. By dragging her away from the edge.

Context: When it comes to President Obama, most of his personal business is already known by the public. Personal information about his children, Malia and Sasha, however, has been kept a little more _ .
The New York Timesrecently released a list of rules that Michelle Obama has mentioned over the years that Malia and Sasha must follow during their time in the White House, as well as in general. See how the first family educates their children:
The girls must write reports about what they've seen on their trips, even if it's not required by their school.
Malia may use her cell phone only on the weekends, and she and her sister cannot watch television or use a computer for anything but homework during the week.
Malia and Sasha have to play two sports: one they choose and one selected by their mother.
Malia must learn todo laundry  before she leaves for college.
The girls have to eat their vegetables, and if they say they are not hungry, they cannot ask for cookies or chips later.
While these might be shocking to some, Michelle said, ""They're not little princess. It's just basic rules, boundaries, and expectations that we would have normally.""
Michelle also mentions another set of rules:
The girls must do their chores , though the White House has a large staff. Malia and Sasha have chores of their own.
They must play a team sport, because it's about learning how to play on a team, how to lose and how to win gracefully.

Context: Danger-junkie orangutans  in Borneo climb dead trees and shake then until they begin to fall. They scream with excitement as they cling to the falling tree. Just before the tree hits the ground the orangutans leap to another tree or vine, narrowly escaping death. While no one cab ask orangutans if they enjoy it as a person playing an extreme sport, one animal behaviorist sees this monkey fun as a bit of harmless thrill-seeking.
A growing number of scientists agree that animals are conscious and capable of experiencing basic emotions , such as happiness, sadness, boredom or depression. A few scientists even see the possibility for higher animal emotions like love, jealousy and spite.
Five years ago, behaviorist and animal-rights activist Dr. Jonathan Balcombe stood on a Virginia hotel balcony watching two crows intimately groom   each other in the comfort of an abandoned billboard. He felt that the birds liked what they were doing, even if engaged in a natural, beneficial act, such as picking parasites   off the other's feathers. That moment changed the way he would view animals forever and led to a book, ""Pleasurable Kingdom: Animals and the Nature of Feeling Good"", which is filled with hundreds of examples of animals living it up thanks to developed senses of touch, taste, sight, sound and smell.
Balcombe recounts a favorite example of Kenyan hippos   having high-end spa treatment in a fresh water spring. They splay their toes, open their mouths wide and wait for a school of cleaner fish to remove parasites and slough off dead skin, he recalls. Balcombe knows that the hippos and the fish both benefit from this arrangement. ""My interpretation is that it is also enjoyable for them ,"" he says. 
 Question:We can conclude from the passage that   _  . 
A. only a few animals have emotions 
B. Balcombe's theory is not supported by other scientists 
C. Balcombe has watched a lot of animals showing emotions 
D. Balcombe can understand animal language

Context: So the little girl now walked on, her bare feet quite red and blue with the cold. She carried a small bundle of matches in her hand, and a good many more in her tattered dress. No one had bought any of them the live long day; no one had given her a single penny. Trembling with cold and hunger crept she on, the picture of sorrow: poor little child!
The snow-flakes fell on her long, fair hair, which curled in such pretty ringlets over her shoulders; but she thought not of her own beauty, or of the cold. Lights were glimmering through every window, and the savor of roast goose reached her from several houses;it was New Year's eve, and it was of this that she thought.
In a corner formed by two houses, one of which projected beyond the other. She sat down, drawing her little feet close under her, but in vain, she could not warm them. She dared not go home, she had sold no matches, earned not a single penny, and perhaps her father would beat her,besides her home was almost as cold as the street,it was an attic; and although the larger of the many chinks in the roof were stopped up with straw and rags. The wind and snow often penetrated through. Her hands were nearly dead with cold; one little match from her bundle would warm them. Perhaps, if she dared light it, she drew one out, and struck it against the wall, bravo! It was a bright, warm flame, and she held her hands over it. It was quite an illumination for that poor little girl; no, I call it rather a magic taper, _ , so beautifully blazed the fire within! The child stretched out her feet to warm them also; alas, in an instant the flame had died away, the stove disappeared, the little girl sat cold and comfortless, with the burnt match in her hand. 
 Question:Which below is not the reason why the little girl dared not go home? 
A. She earned not a single penny. 
B. Her father would beat her. 
C. Her home was almost as cold as the street.

Context: He Made It!
One Sunday, Gavin, a teenager, went skiing at Sugarloaf Mountain in Maine. In the early afternoon, when he was planning to go home, a fierce snowstorm swept into the area. Unable to see far, he accidentally turned off the path. Before he knew it, Gavin was lost, all alone! He didn't have food, water, a phone, or other supplies. He was getting colder by the minute.
Gavin had no idea where he was. He tried not to panic. He thought about all of the survival shows he had watched on TV. It was time to put the tips he had learned to use.
He decided to stop skiing. There was a better chance of someone finding him if he stayed put. The first thing he did was to find shelter from the freezing wind and snow. If he didn't, his body temperature would get very low, which could quickly kill him.
Using his skis, Gavin built a snow cave. He gathered a huge mass of snow and dug out a hole in the middle. Then he piled branches on top of himself, like a blanket, to stay as warm as he could.
By that evening, Gavin was really hungry. He ate snow and drank water from a nearby stream so that his body wouldn't lose too much water. Not knowing how much longer he could last, Gavin did the only thing he could -- he huddled   in his cave and slept.
The next day, Gavin went out to look for help, but he couldn't find anyone. He followed his tracks and returned to the snow cave, because without shelter, he could die that night. On Tuesday, Gavin went out again to find help. He had walked for about a mile when a volunteer searcher found him. After two days stuck in the snow, Gavin was saved.
Gavin might not have survived this snowstorm had it not been for TV. He had often watched Grylls' survival show Man vs. Wild. That's where he learned the tips that saved his life. In each episode   of Man vs. Wild, Grylls is abandoned in a wild area and has to find his way out.
When Grylls heard about Gavin's amazing deeds, he was super impressed that Gavin had made it since he knew better than anyone how hard Gavin had to work to stay alive. 
 Question:How did Gavin keep himself warm? 
A. He found a shelter. 
B. He built a snow cave. 
C. He lighted some branches. 
D. He kept on skiing. 
 Answer: B
Context: At least once each winter I manage to get a good flight in the middle of a snowstorm. Last Sunday was that flight. My gliding  partners had looked at the weather reports of showers and decided to stay at home. People say that you shouldn't fly by yourself, but on that day I felt the urge to go flying and so headed for my favorite gliding site.
I had the mountain ridge to myself. After a smooth lift-off, I floated stably in the breeze, feeling at peace with myself and the world. I looked across the valley to Bedford and a moment later saw the town disappear in a band of snow that was moving towards me.
The breeze remained strong enough for flying and I knew that as long as the _ was good, it was OK for me to stay in the air. The snow moved in and swirled around me. It was a light dry snow. The day was already very quiet but, somehow, the light snow made it even more silent. I felt like a snowflake.
Two bald eagles joined me. They didn't pay me any attention and spent a few minutes flying around the ridge before disappearing. I flew through another band of snow. I had been flying for about 45 minutes when I next looked across the valley. I could see there were more bands of snow to come and the breeze was dying too.
It was time to go home, get in a hot bath and warm up. I couldn't wait to tell my gliding partners that they had missed out on a perfect flight. 
 Question:What can be inferred from the passage? 
A. The bald eagle can cause damage to the author's flight 
B. The author will land and go home after the snow stops 
C. Brand of snow will be a great threat to the author's flight 
D. The author will hesitate to share his experience with his partners

Context: While success is surely sweeter than failure, it seems failure is a far better teacher, and organizations that fail spectacularly often flourish more in the long run, according to a new study by Vinit Desai, assistant professor of management at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. Researchers have found that people missing their goals perform much better in the long run. That is because they gain more knowledge from their failures than their successes and the lessons are more likely to stay longer in their minds.
""We found that the knowledge gained from success was often fleeting while knowledge from failure stuck around for years,"" said professor Desai, who led the study. ""But companies often ignore failure. Managers may fire people or turn over the whole workforce while they should treat the failure as a learning opportunity.""
Prof Desai compared the flights of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Challenger. During the 2002 Atlantis flight, a piece of insulation   broke off and damaged the left solid rocket booster   but didn't influence the program. There was little investigation. The Challenger was launched next and another piece of insulation broke off. This time the shuttle and its seven-person crew were destroyed. The disaster led to a major investigation resulting in 29 changes to prevent future disasters.
The difference in response in the two cases came down to this: Atlantis was considered a success and the Challenger a failure.
""Despite crowded skies, airlines are extremely reliable,"" he said. ""The number of failures is extremely small. And past researches have shown that older airlines, those with more experience in failure, have a lower number of accidents.""
Prof Desai doesn't recommend finding out failure in order to learn. Instead, he advises organizations to analyze small failures to collect useful information rather than wait for major failures. 
 Question:Fewer accidents happen to older airlines in that   _  . 
A. their planes couldn't fly high in the sky 
B. they gained much from experience in failure 
C. their planes were often checked by the experts 
D. they were unpopular among passengers 
 Answer: B
Context: One day Marilla said, ""Anne, your new teacher, Miss Stacy, spoke to me yesterday. She says you must study for the examinations for Queen's College in two years' time. Then if you do well, you can study at Queen's in Charlottetown for a year, and after that you'll be a teacher!""
""That doesn't matter, Anne. When Matthew and I adopted you three years ago, we decided to look after you as well as we could. Of course we'll pay for you to study.""So in the afternoons Anne and some of her friends stayed late at school, and Miss Stacy helped them with the special examination work. Diana didn't want to go to Queen's, so she went home early, but Gilbert stayed. He and Anne still never spoke and everybody knew that they were enemies, because they both wanted to be first in the examination. Secretly, Anne was sorry that she and Gilbert weren't friends, but it was too late now.
For two years, Anne studied hard at school. She enjoyed learning, and Miss Stacy was pleased with her. But she didn't study all the time. In the evenings and at weekends she visited her friends, or walked through the fields with Diana, or sat talking to Matthew.
""Your Anne is a big girl now. She's taller than you,"" Rachel Lynde told Marilla one day.
""You're right, Rachel!"" said Marilla in surprise.
""And she's a very good girl now, isn't she? She doesn't get into trouble these days. I'm sure she helps you a lot with the housework, Marilla.""
""Yes, I don't know what I'd do without her,"" said Marilla, smiling.
""And look at her! Those beautiful grey eyes, and that red-brown hair! You know, Marilla, I thought you and Matthew made a mistake when you adopted her. But now I see I was wrong. You've looked after her very well.""
""Well, thank you, Rachel,"" replied Marilla, pleased.
That evening, when Matthew came into the kitchen, he saw that his sister was crying.
""What's the matter?"" he asked, surprised. ""You haven't cried since... well, I can't remember when.""
""It's just... well, I was thinking about Anne,"" said Marilla. ""I'll...I'll miss her when she goes away.""
""When she goes to Queen's, you mean? Yes, but she can come home at weekends, on the train.""
""I'll still miss her,"" said Marilla sadly.""
In June the Avonlea boys and girls had to go to Charlottetown to take their examinations.
""Oh, I do hope that I've done well,"" Anne told Diana when she arrived back at Green Gables. ""The examinations were very difficult. And I've got to wait for three weeks before I know! Three weeks! I'll die!""
Anne wanted to do better than Gilbert. But she also wanted to do well for Matthew and Marilla. That was very important to her.
Diana was the first to hear the news, she ran into the kitchen at Green Gables and shouted, ""Look, Anne! It's in Father's newspaper! You're first... with Gilbert... out of all the students on the island! Oh, how wonderful!"" Anne took the paper with shaking hands, and saw her name, at the top of the list of two hundred. She could not speak.
""Well, now, I knew it,"" said Matthew with a warm smile.
""You've done well, I must say, Anne,"" said Marilla, who was secretly very pleased.
For the next three weeks Anne and Marilla were very busy. Anne needs new dresses to take to Charlottetown. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is true? 
A. To be a teacher was one of Annes' dreams. 
B. Both Anne and Diana studied hard for the special examination. 
C. Matthew and Marilla were Anne's parents. 
D. Anne was adopted by Matthew and Marilla. 
 Answer: D
Context: ""Find a job you love, and you'll never work a day in your life."" Do you agree with this old saying? Joanne Gordon does. She is the author of Be Happy at work and other books about careers . Gordon believes that about 30% of employees  in North America do not like their jobs, and she thinks that is terrible. She wants to help people who do not feel satisfied with their jobs find work that is good for them. Joanne says, ""There are no happy jobs, only happy workers."" She believes that happy workers share three main characteristics.
First, happy workers enjoy the daily activities of their jobs, and they look forward to the workday. Take Tony Hawk, for example. At age 14, he became a professional skateboarder. Now he is a businessman working on projects related to skateboarding--films and video games, but he still skates every day. He once said, ""My youngest son's pre-school was recently asked what their dads do for work. My son said, 'I've never seen my dad do work.'"" Tony agrees that his job doesn't look like work. He has found a way to spend each day doing a job he enjoys.
Second, happy workers like the people they work with. Sally Ayote says, ""I work with the coolest people in the world."" She and her group cook for almost 1,200 people in Antarctica. Most of these people are scientists who are doing research. Sally loves to sit and talk with them. She says, ""There is no television here, no radio, so I get to know the scientists and what they're studying."" Sally thinks she has a great job, and the best part about it is the people.
Third, happy workers know that their work helps others. Caroline Baron's work helps people who have had to leave their home countries because of war or other dangers. She is a filmmaker who started an organization called FilmAid, which shows movies in refugee  camps around the world. Caroline believes that movies can be very helpful in these camps. For one thing, entertaining movies let refugees forget their troubles for a little while. Movies can also teach important subjects like health and safety. For example, in one camp, thousands of refugees saw a movie about how to get clean water. Caroline knows that is helping other people, and this makes her feel proud and happy about her work.
Tony Hawk, Sally Ayote, and Caroline Baron all get great satisfaction from their work. Tony Hawk says, ""Find the thing you love. If you are doing what you love, there is much more happiness there than being rich or famous."" Joanne Gordon would agree. She encourages people to find something they enjoy doing, find people they like to work with, and find ways to help others. Then they can be proud of what they do, and they will probably be happy at work. 
 Question:Who is the book, Be Happy at Work, written for? 
A. Joanne Gordon herself. 
B. Tony Hawk, Sally Ayote, and Caroline Baron. 
C. People who do not feel satisfied with their jobs. 
D. The workers who agree with the author's ideas.

Context: Once Dr. Mellinkoff invited me to join him at the hospital to discuss interesting cases(, ) with his  students.The case at hand was a Guatemalan man, aged 34, who had a fever and many other medical problems.His condition was not improving, and there was not much hope he would live.
Dr.: Mellinkoff asked to see the patient.He introduced himself in Spanish and, in a very gentle voice, asked how he felt.The patient smiled and said everything was all right.Then the doctor asked if he was able to eat.The patient said that he had no desire to eat.
""Are you getting food you like?""

""If you had food that you liked, would you eat it?""
""Yes, yes,"" the patient said.
The change in the patient's appearance couldn't have been more obvious.Nothing was said, but it was easy to tell that a message had been sent and had also been received.
Later, the doctor asked why the Guatemalan man wasn't getting food he could eat.One of the students said, ""We all know how difficult it is to get the kitchen to make special meals.""
""Suppose,"" the doctor replied, ""you felt a certain medicine was absolutely necessary but that our hospital didn't carry it, would you accept defeat or would you insist the hospital meet your request?""
""I would probably insist,"" the student said.

Context: Linda was kind of late. Linda, 25, had a lot to do at work, plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Linda felt weak and tired -- maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks.
Several yards away, Frank, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying.
But when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, ""Oh, my God, she fell in!""Frank didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. ""No ! Not you ! ""his girlfriend screamed after him.
She was right to be alarmed. By the time Frank reached Linda, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station.
It was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the arms and drag her away from the edge. That was where Linda briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse.
Linda thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in.
Police and fire officials soon arrived, and Frank told the story to an officer. Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40minute train ride downtown--just as he had been seconds after the rescue, which made her think about her reaction at the time. ""I saw the train coming and I was thinking he was going to die, "" she explained. 
 Question:How did Frank save Linda? 
A. By helping her rise to her feet. 
B. By lifting her to the platform. 
C. By pulling her along the ground. 
D. By dragging her away from the edge.

Context: Suddenly another thought went through Kate's mind like an electric shock. An express train was due to go past about thirty minutes later. If it were not stopped, that long train, full of passengers, would fall into the stream. ""Someone must go to the station and warn the station-master,"" Kate thought. But who was to go? She would have to go herself. There was no one else.
In wind and rain she started on her difficult way. Soon she was at the bridge that crossed the Des Moines River, a bridge also built of wood, just like the bridge across Honey Creek. The storm had not washed this away, but there was no footpath across it. She would have to cross it by stepping from sleeper   to sleeper. With great care she began the dangerous crossing, sometimes on her hands and knees, hardly daring to look down between the sleepers into the wild flood waters below. If she should slip, she would fall between the sleepers, into the rapidly flowing stream.
At last -- she never knew how long it had taken her -- she felt solid ground under her feet. But there was no time to rest. She still had to run more than half a mile and had only a few minutes left. Unless she reached the station before the express did, many, many lives would be lost.
She did reach the station just as the train came into sight. Fortunately the station-master was standing outside. ""The bridge is down! Stop the train! Oh, please stop it!"" Kate shouted breathlessly.
The station-master went pale. He rushed into the station building and came back with a signal light. He waved the red light as the train came into the station. It was not a second too early. 
 Question:What did Kate decide to do? 
A. Stop the express train. 
B. Check the signal light. 
C. Meet the passengers. 
D. Visit the station-master

Context: Jane was running late. Jane, 25, had a lot to do at work, plus visitors on the way: her parents were coming in for Thanksgiving from her hometown. But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Jane felt weak and tired---maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks.
Several yards away, Tom, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying.
But when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, ""Oh, my God, she fell in!"" Tom didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. ""No! Not you!"" his girlfriend screamed after him.
She was right to be alarmed. By the time Tom reached Jane, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station.
It was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the grins and drag her away from the edge. That was where Jane briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse.
Jane thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in.
Police and fire officials soon arrived, and Tom told the story to an officer. Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40-minute train ride downtown-just as he had been seconds after the rescue, which made her think about her reaction at the time. ""I saw the train coming and I was thinking he was going to die,"" she explained. 
 Question:Why did Jennifer try to stop her boyfriend? 
A. Because they would miss their train. 
B. Because he didn't see the train coming. 
C. Because she was sure Jane was hard to lift. 
D. Because she was afraid the train would kill him.

Gary is having a _ party after Month Exam! He invites all of us to come! Since it is a potluck party, I think I will bring some beef noodles. As I know, Lily will take care of the drinks and Gina will bring a big homemade chocolate cake. Can you ask your mom to buy us some KFC fried chicken?

The party will start at noon on March 25, so be sure to be at Gary's place around 11:30 to prepare for the party. By the way, don't forget to invite Amy, who is good at music. If you have any other questions, just call me or write me back.
Take care!

Context: On August 5 at 10:31 p.m. PST, a rover named Curiosity touched down safely on the surface of Mars, and I was lucky enough to have a front-row seat.
My name is Clara, and when I was in Grade 6, I won the essay contest NASA held to name its next Mars rover. The essay I wrote was not even 250 words long, but somehow it was enough to change my life.
I still remember that cold December day, sitting in a science class. I'd finished a worksheet early and decided to get a Time for Kids magazine off Mrs. Estevez's bookshelf. It was the 2008 Invention Issue, but that wasn't the only thing that caught my eye. In the magazine, there was an article about a girl who named the Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity. The article also talked about the essay contest NASA was holding to name its next Mars rover. Before I even knew anything else about it, a single word flooded my 11-year-old mind: Curiosity.
I couldn't wait for the bell to ring so I could get started on my essay. That afternoon, I raced home from the bus stop, sat down at the computer and typed until my fingers ached. It turned out that I was just in time. A few days later, and the contest would have closed.
Five months later, shortly after I had turned 12, I was watching a National Geographic special on mammoths when the phone rang. My mom answered, and immediately, a wide smile spread across her face. When she told me that I had won, I was happier than I could ever remember being, I screamed and ran up and down the stairs and all around the house. I completely forgot about the mammoths and did not even remember to turn off the TV until it was really late.
Curiosity is such an important part of who I am. I have always been fascinated by the stars, the planets, the sky and the universe. I remember as a little girl, my grandfather and I would sit together in the backyard for hours. He'd tell me stories and point out the stars.
My grandfather lived in China, thousands of miles away from my home in Kansas. I loved the stars because they kept us together even when we were apart. They were always there, yet there was so much I didn't know about them. That's what I love so much about space. No matter how much we learn, it will always possess some mystery.
In the past, space exploration may have been a competition to see who got somewhere first or the fastest. But now, it is one of the few things that bring people together. Science is a language that needs no translation. It doesn't matter where you're from or what you look like - you just have to have a thirst for knowledge and a passion for learning in order to succeed.
People often ask me why we go to faraway places like Mars. Why do we explore? My answer to that is simple: because we can; because we're curious; because we as human beings do not just stay holed up in one place. We are constantly wondering and trying to find out what's over the hill and beyond the horizon.
The curiosity rover is more than just a robot. It is more than just a titanium body and aluminum wheels. Curiosity represents the hard work, passion, love and commitment of thousands of people from all over the world who were brought together by science. Science is so awesome. It is breathtaking and mind-blowing; and sometimes, it's just a little bit crazy. The discoveries we make about our world are incredibly humbling. They move us forward and have the potential to benefit all of mankind.
This December it will be four years of my life that have been tied to Curiosity in some way. I've met so many amazing people through this experience, from scientists to engineers to administrators to volunteers. Their devotion and enthusiasm inspire me greatly. My journey with Curiosity and the MSL mission team has shaped the person that I am today, as well as the person I would one day like to become.
I am deeply grateful to everyone who made it possible for me to have this amazing adventure.
And to you, I hope your curiosity takes you far. 
 Question:What is conveyed in the passage? 
A. Curiosity is important to human beings. 
B. A thirst for knowledge helps one grow up. 
C. Entering a contest is a way to achieve success. 
D. Curiosity changes people's attitude towards science. 
 Answer: A
Context: I have a friend named Monty Roberts who owns a horse ranch . He has let me use his house to put on fund-raising events. The last time I was there he introduced me by saying: ""I want to tell you a story. It all goes back to a story about a young man who was the son of an itinerant horse trainer who would go from stable to stable, race track to race track, farm to farm and ranch to ranch, training horses. As a result, the boy's high school career was continually interrupted. When he was a senior, he was asked to write a paper about what he wanted to be and do when he grew up.
""That night he wrote a seven-page paper describing his goal of someday owning a horse ranch. He wrote about his dream in great detail and he even drew a diagram of a 200-acre ranch, showing the location of all the buildings, the stables and the track. Then he drew a detailed floor plan for a 4,000-square-foot house that would sit on a 200-acre dream ranch.
""He put a great deal of his heart into the project and the next day he handed it in to his teacher. Two days later he received his paper back. On the front page was a large red F with a note that read, 'See me after class.'
""The boy with the dream went to see the teacher after class and asked, 'Why did I receive an F?' The teacher said, 'This is an unrealistic dream for a young boy like you. You have no money. You come from an itinerant family. You have no resources. Owning a horse ranch requires a lot of money. You have to buy the land. You have to pay for the original breeding stock and later you'll have to pay large stud fees. There's no way you could ever do it.' Then the teacher added, 'If you will rewrite this paper with a more realistic goal, I will reconsider your grade.'
""The boy went home and thought about it long and hard. He asked his father what he should do. His father said, 'Look, son, you have to make up your own mind on this. However, I think it is a very important decision for you.' Finally, after a week, the boy turned in the same paper, making no changes at all. He stated, 'You can keep the F and I'll keep my dream.' ""
Monty then turned to the group present and said, ""I tell you this story because you are sitting in my 4,000-square-foot house in the middle of my 200-acre horse ranch. I still have that school paper framed over the fireplace."" He added, ""The best part of the story is that two years ago that same schoolteacher brought 30 kids to camp out on my ranch for a week. When the teacher was leaving, he said, 'Look, Monty, I can tell you this now. When I was your teacher, I was something of a dream stealer. During those years I stole a lot of kids' dreams. Fortunately you had enough courage not to give up yours.' ""
""Don't let anyone steal your dreams. Follow your heart, no matter what,"" Monty at last concluded. 
 Question:Which of the following could best express the teacher's feelings when she said the words before leaving the ranch two years ago? 
A. Regretful and proud. 
B. Regretful and guilty. 
C. Honest and sorry. 
D. Embarrassed and proud.

Based on the question, the option and the context select the most appropriate answer from the provided choices ""A."", ""B."", ""C."" and ""D."".
Context: Kiss crisis, hug horrors and the UK's handshake headaches
Greeting someone, saying goodbye - these situations fill me with unease. You have a second to make a dangerous decision. One peck  ? Two pecks? Three? No kisses at all? Why, I think, as I crash into the other person's face, why can't it be as simple as a handshake?
A survey by the soap company Radox in May showed one in five Brits now feels a handshake is ""too formal"", according to the Daily Mail. Some 42 percent said they never shook hands when greeting friends. For one third of people the alternative was a hug, for 16 percent a kiss on the cheek.
British people are known to be reserved   - unfriendly, some would say. Handshakes used to work for us because we didn't have to get too close. But the super-British handshake is no longer fashionable. We want to be more like our easygoing Mediterranean neighbors who greet each other with kisses and hugs.
The trouble is, we still find it a bit awkward. What does a married man do when greeting a married female friend, for example? How should someone younger greet someone older?
Guys don't tend to kiss one another; my male friends in Britain go for the ""manly hug"", taking each other stiffly   in one arm and giving a few thumps on the back with words like ""Take it easy, yeah?"".
The biggest questions, if you do decide to kiss, are how many times and which cheek first. Unlike the French, who comfortably deliver three, our cheek-pecks usually end in embarrassed giggling  : ""Oh, gosh, sorry, I didn't mean to kiss you on the lips, I never know where to aim for first!""
But then it's never been easy for us poor, uncomfortable Brits. Even the handshake had its problems: don't shake too hard, but don't hold the other person's hand too limply   either, and definitely don't go in with sweaty hands.
Maybe it's better to leave it at a smile and a nod. 
 Question:What is the article mainly about? 
A. Origin of the traditional British way of greeting someone. 
B. New trends and problems that Brits have with the way they greet people. 
C. Why the author feels uneasy when greeting someone or saying goodbye. 
D. Differences in greetings between Britain and other Western countries.

Context: ""Mom, you should put some of your things away. The house should be safe for the baby,"" said my son Mark as he walked upstairs with his wife and fifteen-month-old Hannah.
They visited us for the Thanksgiving holiday. After driving all day from Salt Lake to Ft. Collins, his temper showed. ""That one finger rule may work with other kids, but never Hannah,"" he insisted.
When my three granddaughters first moved into our house three years ago, my friend offered me her secret to behave grandchildren. ""Teach them the 'one finger rule'."" All of her five grandchildren learned it at a young age and it proved to also work well with mine. 
I picked up my granddaughter and said, ""Well, Mark, just watch."" I hugged her and walked all around the great room.
""Hannah, you may touch anything in this room you want, but, you can only use one finger."" I showed the technique by touching my forefinger to the sculpture. Hannah followed my example. ""Good girl. Now what else would you like to touch?""
She stretched her finger toward the lamp. I allowed her to touch everything in sight, plants, glass objects, TV, VCR, speakers, etc. If she started to grab , I gently reminded her to use one finger. She always obeyed. However, Hannah, an only child, possessed a more adventurous personality. Her father predicted it would prevent her from accepting the ""one finger rule"".
During their four-day stay, we aided Hannah in remembering ""one finger rule"". She learned quickly. 
Months later, my husband and I drove to Salt Lake. I watched Mark continue to practice the one finger rule. I smiled happily each time he asked Hannah to touch with ""one finger"". 
 Question:How many grandchildren mentioned in the passage have mastered the ""one finger rule""? 
A. 3. 
B. 5. 
C. 8. 
D. 9.

Context: The businessman was deep in debt  and could see no way out. Creditors  were closing in on him. Suppliers were demanding payment. He sat on the park bench, head in hands, wondering if anything could save his company from bankruptcy  .
Suddenly an old man appeared before him. ""I can see that something is troubling you."" he said. After listening to the businessman, the old man said: ""I believe I can help you.""
He asked the man his name, wrote out a check , and pushed it into his hand saying: ""Take this money. Meet me here exactly one year from today, and you can pay me back at that time."" Then he turned and disappeared as quickly as he had come.
The businessman saw in his hand a check for $500,000, signed by John D. Rockefeller, then one of the richest men in the world!
""I can settle all my debts in a moment!"" he realized. But instead, the man decided to put the uncashed check in his safe, just knowing it would give him the strength to work out a way to save his business. 
With renewed optimism, he made better deals and extended terms of payment. He closed several big deals. Within a few months, he was out of debt and making money once again.
Exactly one year later, he returned to the park with the uncashed check. At the agreed-upon time, the old man appeared. But just as the businessman was about to hand back the check and share his success story, a nurse came running up and grabbed the old man.
""I'm so glad I caught him!"" she cried. ""I hope he hasn't been bothering you. He's always escaping from the rest home and telling people he's John D. Rockefeller."" And she led the old man away by the arm.
The businessman stood there, still and shocked.
All year long he'd been wheeling and dealing, buying and selling, believing that he had half a million dollars behind him. Suddenly he realized that it wasn't the money, real or imagined, that had turned his life around. It was his newfound self-confidence that had given him the power to achieve anything he wanted to. 
 Question:What is the message of the story? 
A. An offer of money can be a mixed blessing. 
B. A mad man can save a bankrupt company. 
C. It's always good to have some backup money. 
D. Self-confidence matters in problem-solving.

He asked the man his name, wrote out a check , and pushed it into his hand saying: ""Take this money. Meet me here exactly one year from today, and you can pay me back at that time."" Then he turned and disappeared as quickly as he had come.
The businessman saw in his hand a check for $500,000, signed by John D. Rockefeller, then one of the richest men in the world!
""I can settle all my debts in a moment!"" he realized. But instead, the man decided to put the uncashed check in his safe, just knowing it would give him the strength to work out a way to save his business. 
With renewed optimism, he made better deals and extended terms of payment. He closed several big deals. Within a few months, he was out of debt and making money once again.
Exactly one year later, he returned to the park with the uncashed check. At the agreed-upon time, the old man appeared. But just as the businessman was about to hand back the check and share his success story, a nurse came running up and grabbed the old man.
""I'm so glad I caught him!"" she cried. ""I hope he hasn't been bothering you. He's always escaping from the rest home and telling people he's John D. Rockefeller."" And she led the old man away by the arm.
The businessman stood there, still and shocked.
All year long he'd been wheeling and dealing, buying and selling, believing that he had half a million dollars behind him. Suddenly he realized that it wasn't the money, real or imagined, that had turned his life around. It was his newfound self-confidence that had given him the power to achieve anything he wanted to. 
 Question:The businessman must have been   _   after he received the check. 
A. calm 
B. relieved 
C. annoyed 
D. worried

Context: Nate suffered a devastating blow when he lost his job. His boss had spoken rudely, ""Your services are no longer needed."" Nate left the building filled with despair . By the time he reached home, he was in a deep depression. When he entered his house, he blurted  out to his wife Sophia, ""I lost my job. I am a complete, utter failure."" A tense silence  followed. Then a smile crept  across Sophia's face. ""What great news!"" she responded. ""Now you can write the book you have always wanted to write.""""But I have no job and no prospect (hope) of a job,"" he objected  , completely without hope . ""If I struggle to be an author, then what will we live on? Where will the money come from?""

""To whom does it belong?""

Context: While success is surely sweeter than failure, it seems failure is a far better teacher, and organizations that fail spectacularly often flourish more in the long run, according to a new study by Vinit Desai, assistant professor of management at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. Researchers have found that people missing their goals perform much better in the long run. That is because they gain more knowledge from their failures than their successes and the lessons are more likely to stay longer in their minds.
""We found that the knowledge gained from success was often fleeting while knowledge from failure stuck around for years,"" said professor Desai, who led the study. ""But companies often ignore failure. Managers may fire people or turn over the whole workforce while they should treat the failure as a learning opportunity.""
Prof Desai compared the flights of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Challenger. During the 2002 Atlantis flight, a piece of insulation   broke off and damaged the left solid rocket booster   but didn't influence the program. There was little investigation. The Challenger was launched next and another piece of insulation broke off. This time the shuttle and its seven-person crew were destroyed. The disaster led to a major investigation resulting in 29 changes to prevent future disasters.
The difference in response in the two cases came down to this: Atlantis was considered a success and the Challenger a failure.
""Despite crowded skies, airlines are extremely reliable,"" he said. ""The number of failures is extremely small. And past researches have shown that older airlines, those with more experience in failure, have a lower number of accidents.""
Prof Desai doesn't recommend finding out failure in order to learn. Instead, he advises organizations to analyze small failures to collect useful information rather than wait for major failures. 
 Question:Fewer accidents happen to older airlines in that   _  . 
A. their planes couldn't fly high in the sky 
B. they gained much from experience in failure 
C. their planes were often checked by the experts 
D. they were unpopular among passengers 
 Answer: B
Context: A girl who graduated from a world-famous university wanted to do translation work for authority leaders. She was so happy when she entered the British embassy . She thought it was the greatest happiness in her life as many graduates wanted to get that job while she was one of the few people who got it!
              But when she started her new job, she realized that it was just a job of answering calls and recording staff members' starting and quitting times. It was unappreciated and was supposed to have no future. However, she didn't feel sad about it. She learnt how to love the job. And she loved it when she was working. The names and phone numbers of the staff members were written down on the notebook so that she could remember them. When the phone calls came in, she picked it up as soon as possible. When someone asked her about who was not in the office, she would answer them the right name and the time when they left. Nobody could do that except her.
              Her wonderful performance not only received the compliments from the embassy's staff, but also the employees from the local government. And a leader of a famous company in Britain was also impressed by it and invited her to work for him. After that she became a personal translator of an important leader from Britain and appreciated by the foreigners.
              We cannot choose our destiny , but we can choose the attitude with which we face our life. Maybe the attitude could change our destiny. If we cry to life, life will be gray. If we smile to life, life will smile to us, too. 
 Question:What can we know from the passage? 
A. The girl was once asked to leave the British company. 
B. The foreigners were impressed by her good pronunciation. 
C. People in the British embassy spoke highly of the girl. 
D. The girl was famous for her remembering ability. 
 Answer: C
Context: No one gets through life without experiencing many disappointments. Strangely, though, most people seem unprepared for disappointment and react to it in negative ways. They feel depressed or try to escape from their troubles instead of using disappointment as an opportunity for growth.
One negative reaction to disappointment is depression. A woman trying to win a promotion, for example, works hard for over a year in her department. Helen is so sure she will get the promotion. However, the boss names one of Helen's co-workers for the spot. Deeply depressed, Helen loses her enthusiasm for her job and can barely force herself to show up every day. Helen tells herself that she is a failure and that doing a good job just isn't worth the work.
Another negative reaction to disappointment is the desire to escape. Kevin fails to get into the college his brother is attending, the college that was the focus of all his dreams, and decides to escape his disappointment. Why worry about college at all? Instead, he covers up his real feelings by giving up on his school-work and getting completely involved with friends, parties, and ""good times"".
The positive way to react to disappointment is to use it as a chance for growth. This isn't easy, but it's the only useful way to deal with an inevitable part of life. Helen, the woman who was not promoted, could have handled her disappointment by looking at other options. If her boss did not recognize her talent and hard work, perhaps she could transfer to another department. Or she could ask the boss how to improve her performance so that she could prepare for the next promotion. Kevin, the boy who didn't get into the college of his choice, should look into other schools. Going to another college may encourage him to be his own person, step out of his brother's shadow, and realize that being turned down by one college isn't a final judgment on his abilities or potential.
Disappointments are unwelcome, but regular visitors to everyone's life. We can feel depressed about them or we can try to escape from them. The best thing, though, is to accept a disappointment and then try to use it somehow: Step over the unwelcome visitor on the doorstep and get on with life.

Context: ""Tear' em apart!"" ""Kill the fool!"" ""Murder the referee  !""
These are common remarks one may hear at various sporting events. At the time they are made, they may seem innocent enough. But let's not kid ourselves. They have been known to influence behavior in such a way as to lead to real bloodshed. Volumes have been written about the way words affect us. It has been shown that words having certain connotations   may cause us to react in ways quite foreign to what we consider to be our usual humanistic behavior. I see the term ""opponent"" as one of those words. Perhaps the time has come to delete it from sports terms.
The dictionary meaning of the term ""opponent"" is ""adversary"" ""enemy""; ""one who opposes your interests."" Thus, when a player meets an opponent, he or she may tend to treat that opponent as an enemy. At such times, winning may dominate one's intellect, and every action, no matter how gross, may be considered justifiable. I recall an incident in a handball game when a referee refused a player's request for a time out for a glove change because he did not consider them wet enough. The player proceeded to rub his gloves across his wet T-shirt and then exclaimed. ""Are they wet enough now?""
In the heat of battle, players have been observed to throw themselves across the court without considering the consequences that such a move might have on anyone in their way. I have also witnessed a player reacting to his opponent's international and illegal blocking by deliberately hitting him with the ball as hard as he could during the course of play. Off the court, they are good friends. Does that make any sense? It certainly gives proof of a court attitude which departs from normal behavior.
Therefore, I believe it is time we elevated   the game to the level where it belongs there by setting an example to the rest of the sporting world. Replacing the term ""opponent"" with ""associate"" could be an ideal way to start.
The dictionary meaning of the term ""associate"" is ""colleague""; ""friend""; ""companion."" Reflect a moment! You may soon see and possibly feel the difference in your reaction to the term ""associate"" rather than ""opponent."" 
 Question:According to the passage, players, in a game, may   _  .

Context: ""Linda, if beating yourself up were an Olympic sport, you'd win a gold medal!""
Annabel, my close friend, stunned(...)me with that frank observation after I told her how I had mishandled a situation with a student in a third-grade class where I was substituting . ""I should never have let him go to the boy's room without a pass! It was my fault he got into trouble with the hall monitor! I'm so stupid!""
My friend burst out laughing, and then made her ""Olympic"" comment. After a brief period of reflection I had to admit that she was right. I did put myself down an awful lot. Why, just during the previous day I had called myself ""a slob"" for having some papers spread out on my desk, ""ugly"" when I left the house without makeup and ""an idiot"" when I left the house for an emergency substitute job without my emergency lesson plan.
In a more reflective tone, Annabel said, ""I once took a workshop at church where the woman in charge had us list all the mean things we say about ourselves.""
""How many did you have on your list?"" I asked.
""Fifteen,"" she confessed. ""But then the teacher said, 'Now turn to the person next to you and say all the items on your list as if you were speaking to that person!' ""
My jaw dropped,""What did you do?""
""Nothing. Nobody did. We all just sat there, until I said, 'I could never say these things to anyone else!' ""
""And our teacher replied, 'Well, if you can't say them to anyone else, then don't ever say them to yourself!' ""
My friend had a point. I would never insult a child of God---and I'm God's child, too!
God, today let me be as kind to myself as I would be to another of Your children. 
 Question:What does the writer mean by the last sentence of the passage? 
A. She is ready to turn to God for help. 
B. She will be kind to all children. 
C. She won't insult  herself as well as others. 
D. She is willing to be a child of God.

Context: Gabby Douglas stood beneath the Rio Olympic Arena, still in her Team USA leotard, trying hard to understand how she had become the most unpatriotic athlete in Rio. Tears filled in her eyes. She tried hard to talk but no words came out. Her pauses were long and uncomfortable.
""I've been trying to stay off the Internet because there's so much negativity,"" she said. The attacks against her have been everywhere these last few days. The bullies blamed her for not putting her hand over her heart while the US national song played. Besides, some other people attacked her for not jumping up and cheering hard enough for team-mates at the all-around final. All of this prompted her mother, Natalie Hawkins, to tell Reuters this weekend, that Douglas is ""heartbroken"".
It showed on Sunday, in Douglas's final performance of this Olympics and maybe in the Games ever. Douglas finished sixth in the uneven bars, far from the medal stand she owned four years ago in London, and shook her head, confused. What had she done wrong? Nothing made sense.
""I mean, you do [Olympics] for your country, and you do it for yourself, how have I offended them? What have I done? I was standing in respect for USA. I'm coming out there representing them to the best of my abilities, so how would I be in disrespect? 
 Question:Why was Douglas heartbroken? 
A. Because she lost the chance to take part in the Olympic Games. 
B. Because she didn't win any medal. 
C. Because she was criticized by many people for her unintentional behaviors. 
D. Because she made a big mistake.

Context: Apologizing is both an Art and a Science. The Art lies in the manner in which the apology is delivered while the Science is the recipe that forms the apology itself. A proper apology should always include several ingredients. Now let's take a closer look at these ingredients.
Give a detailed account of the offense, and make sure both you and the other person are talking about the same thing. Whether you make it in secret or public doesn't matter, but your apology should be focused on the particular event.
Next, by acknowledging the hurt or damage done, you are making the recipient   begin to sense that you understand the situation. It is important to rebuild your relationship because it makes them feel their anger is understandable.
Don't try to defend yourself by offering any excuses, which is important to let them know that you understand the event and you actions do cause them harm. The apology is all about THEM and how they feel. It doesn't matter if the actions were intentional or not, the end result is the same and that is what needs to be focused on when learning how to say, ""I'm sorry"".
Give a sincere statement of regret such as ""I apologize"" or ""I'm sorry"". Above all, tell them it won't happen again. After all, there is no value in apologizing for something that you will do again and again.
Finally, asking for forgiveness at the end of the apology gives the power back to the recipient. It tells them, that you have done all that you can do by apologizing and providing whatever form of restitution you can. The next move is up to them.

Context: Kids may need to apologize if they do something they know was wrong-like telling a lie or breaking a rule on purpose. When they do something their parents tell them not to do, or they don't do something they are supposed to do, they apologize, too.

Context: People often view the ""last"" moments of an event positively simply because they signal the end of an experience, say experts.
University of Michigan researchers found that even if an experience is painful or negative, but ends on a good note, people will consider it to be positive.
""Endings are powerful,"" said Ed O'Brien, a graduate student in the Department of Psychology at the University of Michigan.
O'Brien and colleague Phoebe Ellsworth, the Frank Murphy Distinguished Professor of Law and Psychology, conducted a chocolate tasting experiment with 52 college students to test the theory.
Volunteers could taste five different Hershey's Kisses chocolates--milk, dark, cream, caramel and almond - but did not know in advance how many pieces they would eat or the type. Participants rated how much they enjoyed the chocolate and described each flavor so that the researchers could record the order in which the randomly   selected treats were eaten.
Volunteers were assigned to the ""next"" or the ""last "" condition by chance.
In the ""next"" condition, the experimenter said ""Here is your next chocolate"" before offering each chocolate, including the fifth.
For the ""last"" condition, the experimenter said ""Here is your last chocolate"" before offering  the fifth chocolate.
These participants rated the fifth chocolate more enjoyable than volunteers in the ""next"" condition.
As predicted, participants who knew they were eating the final chocolate of a taste test enjoyed it more.
In fact, when asked to pick their favorite chocolate, the majority of ""last"" participants chose the fifth - even though the flavor of the fifth was randomly chosen.
They also rated the overall experience as more enjoyable than volunteers who thought they were just eating one more chocolate in a series.
O'Brien says these findings may have far-reaching implications. For example, the last book or film in a series or the last speaker in a symposium   may receive _ praise.
The last job applicant, meanwhile, may look more qualified.

Context: About 3 months ago, my father was in hospital recovering from a major lung operation. My mother had recently passed away, and my father had taken the loss of his partner of 58 years very hard and had lost interest in life. It was quite difficult to try to get him to eat each day as he didn't want anything. The one thing, however, that he would ask us to bring him was ice cream.
One evening, to our surprise, he refused to eat the ice cream, so I placed it in a staffroom refrigerator. A little while later, my son said he wanted it, so I fetched it for him. As I passed another ward  , a woman asked, ""Are there more where that came from?"" When I explained, she seemed very disappointed. She then said that she had cancer and could eat very little other than the occasional ice cream.
The next evening, I decided to buy two ice creams. On the way to dad's room, I came into the sick woman's room, and offered her the ice cream I'd bought for her. She was totally astonished that I had thought of her, and accepted the gift with tears in her eyes. I spoke with her for a few minutes, explaining what was happening in my family and listened to her similar story of pain and suffering. It was _ that she did not have many visitors.
I repeated the gesture a few days later, and this time I received a warm hug. I never even thought to ask her name and never saw her again, but it made me realize that a simple act of kindness can bring joy to a person's unfortunate life.

Context: Michael Jordan told me not to mention this until the season was over and I promised him at that time. Now I think it's time.
Early last season, I wrote a column about an act of kindness I had seen Jordan do to a disabled child outside the Stadium. After it _ ,I got a call from a man in the western suburbs. He said, ""I read what you wrote about Jordan, but I thought I should tell you another thing I saw."" Here it comes, I thought. It always does. Write something nice about a person, and people call you up to say that the person is not so nice.
A few weeks later Jordan and I were talking about something else before a game, and I brought up what the man had said. Was the man right? Has Jordan really been talking to those two boys in that poor and dirty neighborhood?
""Not two boys,"" Jordan said, ""but four.""
And he named them. He said four names.
And what did they talk about?
""Everything,"" Jordan said. ""I've asked to see their grades so that I can check whether they're paying attention to their schoolwork. If it turns out one or two of them may need teaching, I make sure they get it.""
It's just one more part of Michael Jordan's life, one more thing that no one knows about, one more thing Jordan does right. The NBA season is over now, and those boys have their memories. So do I! When the expert reviewers begin to turn against Jordan, as they surely will, I'll think about those boys under the streetlight, waiting for the man they know to come, for someone they can depend on.

B. know why Jordan appeared in a poor area 
C. let the author know that Jordan was not that nice 
D. offer another example to show that Jordan was a nice man

Context: Humor is very important in any relationship. It is truly a unique gift when someone has the ability to make another laugh. Humor allows a person to forget his troubles and focus on positive aspects of his life. Personally speaking, making another laugh, whether it is a family member, a close friend, or even a stranger, has always given me a good feeling!
Humor plays an important role in our family lives. The interaction  , between husband and wife and between a parent and a child, is very important, just thinking how much better our relationships would be if we would take the time to laugh.
Humor and laughter are especially important during difficult times. No matter how bad a person may feel, a family member or a friend can make him feel good by laughing with him. I once had a co-worker, for whom there was no humor in her daily life. She seldom smiled and seemed to focus on only the negative or the dark side. One day I was told she was very unhappy, had few friends, and had poor relations with family members. Later, I learnt that she couldn't remember laughing or enjoying life. In order to enjoy her life, she was advised to have humor and laughter each day of her life. In the end, it seemed to make a huge difference.
We do live in a difficult world. ""Stress"" seems to be a major factor contributing to health problems of our society. So, in order to live easily, we should put humor into our daily lives. I have a plaque   hanging on the wall, which reads ""Live, Love and Laugh""! 
 Question:The passage mainly talks about  _  . 
A. some problems in society 
B. humor and relationships 
C. the ways to become humorous 
D. the great importance of humor

Context: Long ago there lived a powerful king. Some of his ideas were good, but others caused people to suffer. One of the king's ideas was to set up a public arena . When a person was accused of a crime, his future would be decided in this arena. It had two doors, side by side, exactly alike. The accused person was taken into the arena and asked to open one. Behind one door was a hungry tiger, while behind the other was a lady chosen especially for him. To this lady he would be immediately married, in honor of his innocence.
The king had a beautiful daughter whom he loved very much , and she secretly loved a young commoner . When the king discovered their relationship, the man was immediately put in prison, and a day was set for him to enter the arena.
The princess knew behind which door stood the tiger, and behind which a lady. She also knew that the lady was one of the loveliest in the kingdom. The princess hated the woman behind that silent door.
As he entered the arena and his eyes met the princess's, the young man knew that she knew behind which door waited the tiger, and behind which stood the lady. The princess raised her hand, and made a short, quick movement toward the right. No one but her lover saw it. Every eye was fixed on him. He turned, and with a firm, quick step he walked across the empty space to the door on the right and opened it.
Now, the point of the story is this: Did the tiger come out of that door, or did the lady? The more we think about this question, the harder it is to answer. It involves a study of the human heart. The soul of the princess loved the young man but also burned under the fires of sadness and jealousy .
The question of her decision cannot be easily answered. And so I leave it with all of you: which came out of the open door? The lady or the tiger?

Context: Many people travel to different places in the world by air. Usually it takes a long time, perhaps half a day, for passengers to stay in the plan. So airlines offer passengers food. But it is common that they feel bad about food taste. Do you agree?
To solve this problem, airlines try hard to improve their food. They would like to do so because they don't want to lose customers.
However, according to scientific research, part of the reason why plane food tastes bad is that at high altitude we can not taste things as well as we do on the ground. Also scientists have found that our noses become very dry even before a plane takes off. As the plane moves up, the change in air  pressure reduces one third of the sensibility of our taste buds . So our taste buds become senseless. The sad face, however, is that our noses don't know it.
All of these help explain why food on the plane tastes so bad. They also help explain why airlines choose to offer passengers salty and spicy food. Without doing so, the food would be tasteless.
Now there are many researches on this. According to one of them, some volunteers are asked to lie with their feet higher than their heads for weeks. And scientists write down their feelings about food taste.
Though scientists try their best, it is not as easy as they thought. Because they can't deal with the special environment successfully, such as the change in air pressure, making food taste good is still hard for them. 
 Question:What do airlines do to solve this problem? 
A. Get more customers. 
B. Offer more food. 
C. Improve their food. 
D. Reduce the ticket price. 
 Answer: C
Context: Once Dr. Mellinkoff invited me to join him at the hospital to discuss interesting cases(, ) with his  students.The case at hand was a Guatemalan man, aged 34, who had a fever and many other medical problems.His condition was not improving, and there was not much hope he would live.
Dr.: Mellinkoff asked to see the patient.He introduced himself in Spanish and, in a very gentle voice, asked how he felt.The patient smiled and said everything was all right.Then the doctor asked if he was able to eat.The patient said that he had no desire to eat.
""Are you getting food you like?""
The patient said nothing.
""Do you get the kind of food you have at home?""
The answer was no.
The doctor put his hand on the man's shoulder and his voice was very soft.
""If you had food that you liked, would you eat it?""
""Yes, yes,"" the patient said.
The change in the patient's appearance couldn't have been more obvious.Nothing was said, but it was easy to tell that a message had been sent and had also been received.
Later, the doctor asked why the Guatemalan man wasn't getting food he could eat.One of the students said, ""We all know how difficult it is to get the kitchen to make special meals.""
""Suppose,"" the doctor replied, ""you felt a certain medicine was absolutely necessary but that our hospital didn't carry it, would you accept defeat or would you insist the hospital meet your request?""
""I would probably insist,"" the student said.
""Very well,"" the doctor said.""You might want to try the same method in the kitchen.It won't be-easy, but I can help you.Meanwhile, let's get some food inside this man as fast as possible, and stay with it.Or he'll be killed by hunger.By the way, there must be someone among you who can speak Spanish.If we want to make real progress, we need to be able to talk with him.""
Three weeks later.Doctor Mellinkoff told me that the Guatemalan man had left the hospital under his own power.It takes more than medicine to help sick people; you also have to talk to them and make them comfortable. 
 Question:The patient had no desire to eat because   _  . 
A. he was not hungry 
B. he was seriously ill 
C. he was given special meals 
D. he was not satisfied with the food

 Answer: C
Context: There is a famous English saying ""You are what you eat"", and _ means what you put in your mouth will become part of you. Many experts   use it to tell people it's important to have a good eating habit. For example, too much sweet food makes a person overweight . To avoid being fat, kids are told to keep off sweet food. But, a team of American scientists have found something new about eating sweet food.
""When we say some people 'sweet', we mean they are kind and friendly to us. Perhaps  this word can help us learn more about people's feelings and acts."" said Brian Meier, a scientist from the study team. ""Taste is something we experience every day. What we have done is to find whether we can know someone's character  and behavior  depending on their taste.""
In one of their experiments ,  students were asked questions about their character-whether, for example, they were soft-hearted or not. Then they were asked to make a list of their favorite food. According to their answers, the scientists found that the students who liked sweet food were nicer.
In their another experiment, the scientists found that people who preferred sweet food such as cookies and chocolate were more willing to help other people in need, and those who ate non-sweet food such as chips weren't. For example, people with a sweet tooth were more likely to volunteer to clean up their city, visit sick children in the hospital and so on.
The result of the experiments is that people's helpfulness or being nice has something to do with their taste for sweet food. So eating sweet food is a useful way to make people nice and helpful. Next time, try some ice-cream.

 Question:According to the passage, which of the followings is NOT true? 
A. There is some relationship between someone's character and their taste. 
B. Kids are told to keep away from sweet food to be fat. 
C. What you put in your mouth will show your character. 
D. If people want to be kind or friendly, they can try some sweet food.

Context: Back in the old days, when I was a child, we sat around the family roundtable at dinnertime and exchanged our daily experiences. It wasn't very organized, but everyone was recognized and all the news that had to be told was told by each family member.
We listened to each other and the interest was not put-on; it was real. Our family was a unit and we supported each other, and nurtured each other, and liked each other, and--we were even willing to admit--we loved each other.
Today, the family roundtable has moved to the local fast-food restaurant and talk is not easy, much less encouraged.
Grandma, who used to live upstairs, is now. the voice on long distance, and the working parent is far too beaten down each day to spend evening relaxation time listening to the sandbox experience of an eager four-year-old.
So family conversation is as extinct as my old toys and parental questions such as ""What have you been doing, Bobby?"" have been replaced by ""I'm busy, go watch television. ""
And watch TV they do; count them by the millions.
But it's usually not children's television that children watch. Saturday morning, the children's hour, amounts to only about 8 percent of their weekly viewing.
Where are they to be found? Watching adult television, of course, from the Match Game in the morning, to the afternoon at General Hospital, from the muggings and battles on the evening news right through the family hour and past into Starsky and Hutch. That's where you find our kids, over five million of them, at 10 p. m. , not fewer than a million until after midnight! All of this is done with parental permission.
Television, used well, can provide enriching experiences for our young people, but we must use it with some sense. When the carpet is clean, we turn off the vacuum cleaner. When the dishes are clean, the dishwasher turns itself off.
Not so the television, which is on from the sun in the morning to the moon at night and beyond!
Parents must exercise some control and show some concern about the cultural influence on the child when a program not intended for that child is viewed. Parents need to intervene  . Nonintervention may be a wise policy in international affairs, but the results of parental nonintervention will not be wise at all. 
 Question:The working parent is not willing to listen to her (his) four-year-old child talking about his sandbox games because   _  . 
A. she (he) is boring 
B. she (he) is busy 
C. she (he) is very tired 
D. she (he) is angry

Context: The idea of not having a phone at ail could be beneficial sounds crazy to people who are addicted to the global Internet or even just Facebook.
Indeed, it sounds like a pain. But some luxuries of a phone-free lifestyle make us realize that freedom has long been absent from our lives with a phone.
According to The Wall Street Journal's Anton Troianovski. people expect less of you when you don't have a cell phone. Melissa Hildebrand, for example, doesn't even own n phone. She just leaves if her friends don't turn up on time for an event or meeting. ""She gives them 15 to 30 minutes to show up,"" writes Troianovski. With a cell phone in hand, one receives apology calls, which will lengthen the waiting. Without a phone, that responsibility seems to reduce. 
Dean Obeidallah of CNN believes that not having a cell phone gives him the ability to see things; A beautiful woman burning past while fixing her makeup; Asian tourists busy taking photos; a businessman talking on his phone and looking important. ""Instead of texting or checking my e-mail, I began to actually, look at the people I sharing the streets with. It is truly like a movie set filled with extras  from all walks of life, Obeidallah said.
Along with these small benefits of not having a phone, however, come all its inconvenience.
Nancy Kadlick told The Wall Street Journal that she once missed an airport pick-up due to not having a phone.
For Rebecca Greenfield, a columnist for the Atlantic Wire, the inconvenience of not having a phone outweigh(;) these small luxuries. But she also said: ""Not having one every once in a while sounds like a nice practice."" 
 Question:According to Dean Obeidallah, not having a phone can help him_. 
A. enjoy the surroundings 
B. communicate with people on the street 
C. watch more movies sets 
D. explore all walks of life 
 Answer: A
Context: Tom was three years old. He liked to watch TV with his parents after supper, but his parents never let him stay long. Mother would say, ""It's eight o'clock now. It's time for you to go to bed, Tom.""
""But why don't you go to bed, too?"" Tom always asked.
""We are adults  ,"" mother would say, ""And adults go to bed late.""
One evening Tom asked his mother for an apple.
""But it's too late,"" his mother didn't want to give him anything to eat at bedtime. ""The apples are already asleep.""
""But not all of them, Mom."" Tom said, ""The baby apples are perhaps asleep, but their parents are surely awake."" 
 Question:His parents   _  let him stay long. 
A. never 
B. sometimes 
C. often 
D. usually 
 Answer: A
Context: I want to tell you some things about Tom's weekend. He is my good friend. At the weekend, Tom usually gets up late. He has breakfast. Then he reads an English book and listens to the radio for about one hour. After that he starts to do his homework. At about 11:30, he often cooks   lunch for his family. In the afternoon, he usually plays volleyball with his friends. Sometimes he goes to the library in the afternoon. He loves his weekend very much. 
 Question:Tom   _   at the weekend. 
A. is not happy 
B. has a good time 
C. is very free 
D. doesn't do his homework 
 Answer: B
Context: When I asked my daughter which item she would keep; the phone, the car, the cooker, the computer, the TV, or her boyfriend, she said""the phone"". Personally, I could do without the phone entirely, which makes me unusual. Because the telephone is changing our lives more than any other piece of technology.
Point 1 The telephone creates the need to communicate, in the same way that more roads create more traffic. My daughter comes home from school at 4:00 pm and then spends an hour on the phone talking to the very people she has been at school with all day. If the phone did not exist, would she have anything to talk about?
Point 2 The mobile phone means that we are never alone. ""The mobile saved my life,""says Crystal Johnstone. She had an accident in her Volvo on the A45 between Otley and Skipton. Trapped inside, she managed to make the call that brought the ambulance  to her rescue.
Point 3 The mobile removes our secret. It allows marketing manager of Haba Deutsch, Carl Nicolaisen, to ring his sales staff all round the world at and time of day to ask where they are , where they are going, and how their last meeting went.
Point 4 The telephone separates us. Antonella Bramante in Rome says, ""We worked in separate offices but I could see him through the window. It was easy to get his number. We were so near----but we didn't meet for the first two weeks!""
Point 5 The telephone allows us to reach out beyond our own lives. Today we can talk to several complete strangers simultaneously ( ) on chat lines (at least my daughter does. I wouldn't know what to talk about). We can talk across the world. We can even talk to astronauts (if you know any) while they're space-walking. And, with the phone line hooked up to the computer, we can access  the Internet, the biggest library on Earth. 
 Question:Which of the following best shows people's attitude towards mobile phones? 
A. Mobile phones help people deal with the emergency. 
B. Mobile phones bring convenience as well little secret to people. 
C. Mobile phones are so important and should be encouraged. 
D. Mobile phones are part of people's life.
