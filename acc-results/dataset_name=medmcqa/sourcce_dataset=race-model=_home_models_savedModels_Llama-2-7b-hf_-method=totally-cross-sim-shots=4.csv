Context: Imagine you're in a dark room, running your fingers over a smooth surface in search of a single dot the size of this period, How high do you think the dot must be for your finger to feel it?
Scientists have determined that the human finger is so sensitive it can detect a surface bump just one micron(l0-6m)""high. The human eye, by contrast, can't tell anything much smaller than100 microns.No wonder we rely on touch rather than eyesight when faced with a new roll of toilet paper.
Biologically, touch is the mother of all sensory  systems.It is an ancient sense in evolution: even the simplest single-celled living things can feel when something brushes up against them and will respond by moving closer or pulling away. It is the first sense aroused during a baby's development and the last to weaken at life's peak. Patients in a deep coma  who seem otherwise lost to the world will show skin reaction when touched by a nurse.
""Touch ,is so central to what we are that we almost cannot imagine ourselves without it,"" said Chris Dijkerman.""It's 'not like eyesight, where you close your eyes and you don't see anything. _ .It's always there.""
Long ignored in favor of the sensory heavyweights of eyesight and hearing, the study of touch lately:: has been gaining new concern among scientists.They're exploring the effects of recently reported false touch impressions, of people being made to feel as though they had three arms, for example, with the hope of gaining the true understanding of how the mind works.
Others are turning to touch for more practical purposes: to build better touch screen instruments and robot hands, a more well-rounded virtual life.. ""There's a fair amount of research into new ways of offloading information onto our sense of touch,"" said Lynette Jones. ""To have your cell phone buzzing (making a low sound) as opposed to ringing turned out to have a lot of advantages in.some situations.""
Touch is our most active sense, our means of seizing the world and experiencing it 'first hand. Dr.Susan Lederman pointed out that while we can become aware of something by seeing or hear,ing7;-.from a distance and without really trying, if we want to learn about something by means of touch, we must make a move.We must rub the cloth, or pet the cat. Touching is a two-way street, and that's not true for seeing or hearing. If you have a soft object and you squeeze it, you change its shape. The physical world reacts back.""
Our hands are smart and can do many tasks automatically - button a shirt, fit a key in a lock, play the; piano for others.Dr.Lederman and her colleagues have shown that blindfolded subjects can easily recognize a wide range of common -objects placed.in their hands.But on some feeling tasks, touch is all thumbs (very clumsy). When people are given a raised line drawing of a common object, they're puzzled.""If all we've got is outline information;"" Dr.Lederman said,.""no weight, no texture, no temperature information, well, we're very, very bad with that.""
Touch also turns out to be easy to fool, Among the sensory tricks now being investigated is something called the Pinocchio illusion. Researchers have found that if they shake the band of the biceps , many people report feeling that their forearm is getting 'longer, their hand floating ever further from their elbow . And if they are told to touch the forefinger of the shaken arm to the tip of their nose, they feel as though their nose was lengthening, too. 
 Question:The sense that is firstly awaked during a child's development is the sense of  _  . 
A. sight 
B. taste 
C. hearing 
D. touch

Context: During the day we work and play,and at night we sleep. Our body rests when we sleep. In the morning we are ready to work and play again. Our body grows most when we are asleep. Children who are tired usually need sleep. We can get better at our lessons after having plenty of rest. Boys and girls who are eight or nine years old need ten hours of sleep every night. Our body needs plenty of air when we are asleep. If we do not get enough fresh air, we will feel tired when we wake up. While in bed we must not cover our head,our lungs need to get enough fresh air. If we open our windows at night,we can have plenty of fresh air. Cool air is better than warm air. 
 Question:What do the lungs need most? 
A. Fresh air. 
B. Exercise. 
C. Warm air. 
D. Cold air. 
 Answer: A
Context: Air is an odorless  , invisible   gas that surrounds the earth. It is everywhere on the planet. An ""empty"" drinking glass and an ""empty"" room, to give two examples, are not really empty. Each is filled with air. When the glass is filled with water, the water pushes the air out of the glass.
Air, as a gas, has no definite   shape, but, because it is matter, it takes up space. It is easy to prove that air is something that takes up space. _ a dry handkerchief into the bottom  of a glass so that it will not fall out when the glass is turned upside-down. Push the upside-down glass; hold it straight into a jar of water till the glass is completely covered. When the glass is taken out of water, the handkerchief will be dry. The air inside the glass takes up space and keeps the water from coming in.

Context: A breathtaking trick potentially left over from our ancestors might be found in us -- the ability to sense oxygen through our skin.
Amphibians, animals such as frogs that can live both on land and in water, have long been known to be capable of breathing through their skin. In fact, the first known lungless frog that breathes only through its skin was discovered recently in the rivers of Borneo.
Now the same oxygen sensors found in frog skins and in the lungs of mammals   have unexpectedly been discovered in the skin of mice.
""No one had ever looked,"" explained Randall Johnson, a biologist researcher.
Mice and frogs are quite distant relatives, so the fact they have these molecules   in common in their skin suggests they might well be found in the skin of other mammals, such as humans.
""We have no reason to think that they are not in the skin of people too,"" Johnson said.
These molecules not only detect oxygen, but help increase levels of vital red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body. Normal mice breathing in air that is 10 percent oxygen--a dangerously low level similar to conditions at the top of Mount Everest, and about half that of air at sea level. However, mice that had the oxygen sensor HIF-1a genetically removed from their skin failed to produce this hormone   even after hours of such low oxygen.
These findings, if they hold true in humans, suggest one could raise the level of oxygen circulating inside the body. This could help treat lung diseases and disorders such as anemia   without injecting drugs, which make up a multibillion-dollar market, Johnson said.
Athletes also often try to get more oxygen delivered to their muscles in order to improve their performance. They often do this by training at high altitudes or in low-oxygen tents. The new study suggests they might want to expose their skin as well as breathing in low-oxygen air to improve their performance. ""It's hard to say what exactly might be done, however--there's a lot we don't know yet,"" Johnson explained.
The scientists detailed their findings in the April 18 issue of the journal Cell. 
 Question:One of the functions of the molecules mentioned above is   _  . 
A. increasing level of oxygen 
B. improving athletes' performance 
C. detecting oxygen 
D. carrying oxygen around the body 
 Answer: C
Context: People who are worried about bad breath often reach for a toothbrush or a gun. But in the future, personal breath monitoring may include far more than fresh breath.
In face, breath is so rich in chemical compounds that fully understanding it has proved challenging. Each breath contains gases like carbon dioxide, the volatile remains of recent snacks, medicines and even compounds taken in from things like carpeting or various kinds of air pollution. But breath detectors  can sort out these substances with increasing sensitivity . 
Scientists are building electronic sniffers that examine the exhaled air for signs of cancer, asthma , and other diseases.
""There are clear signatures in the breath for liver disease, kidney disease and heart disease. Breath is a rich mixture that can reflect out state of health and disease."" said Dr. Raed Dweik, director of the Cleveland Clinic, adding ""Breath analysis is the future of medical testing.""
He and his partners are testing a desktop system called BreathLink for use in rapid identification of diseases. The system is designed to work wherever there is an Internet connection. To use BreathLink, a person breathes into a long tube, and a breath sample is collected and analyzed within the system. Then it can detail chemical concentrations of the breath in graphics. Dr. Raed Dweik said, ""If you examine patients of asthma, you will find they have higher levels of nitric oxide  in their exhaled air. It reflects their abnormal symptoms in the lungs."" His tests have reached 85 percent accuracy so far in spotting people with some illness.
But some trained dogs, he pointed out, can sniff out cancer with 99 percent accuracy--although without the ability to identify particular compounds the way some detectors can.
""We are getting better and better,"" he said. ""But whether we will ever approach the accuracy of the dog--we don't know."" 
 Question:It can be inferred that  _ 
A. brushing teeth can improve one's bad breath 
B. there are leftovers like snacks and medicines in one's breath 
C. one can know exactly about his physical state through the breath 
D. breath analysis can be helpful in medical diagnosis

Context: When most of us look at our hands, we might notice that we need to clean, or stop biting our fingernails, and that's about it. But if you ask a doctor, he can see a whole lot more. Everything from poor diet and stress to serious kidney   problems can be revealed by a glance at your fingernails.
There are about 30 different nail signs that can be associated with medical issues, though may indicate more than one problem, according to Dr.Amy Derick, a clinical instructor of dermatology at Northwestern University.
Here are five of the things a doctor can tell about your health based on your fingernails.
1. People who aren't eating well and lack vitamin or dietary may have thinner than normal nails, which are more likely to break.
2.Horizontal   lines are associated with serious physical stress. They frequently occur in people who have gone through chemotherapy .They can also occur after some illnesses, injuries, or with severe malnourishment .Interestingly, there may be an altitude connection too. They've also been found in people who dove 1,000 feet and others who participated in an Everest exploration.
3. Vertical  lines, however, are generally not such a big deal. Some people are more genetically prone to them than others, but they're commonly associated with aging.
4. When people lack iron, their nails can turn spoon-like. Instead of curving down and covering the finger normally, they 'll start to rise up on the sides and front, like the part of a spoon that holds liquid.
5. Kidney and liver problems can create ""half-and-half nails"", where one part of the nail is white and the other part dark or pink, according to Derick.
Doctors note that because disease diagnosis is complex and some symptoms can be associated with different diseases, you should always see a medical professional if you are concerned about something you notice. 
 Question:Who will have horizontal lines on the nails ? 
A. A cancer patient who has received normal treatment. 
B. Hungry African children suffering from severe malnourishment. 
C. An explorer who had reached Zhangjiajie in Hunan Province. 
D. A patient with serious illness, like kidney and liver problems.

Context: A new study shows that fat people in the United States suffer direct economic and social effects because of their size. The findings are from an 8-year study of about 100,000 people. The people who were studied were between the age of 18 and 24 when the research began.
The researchers who carried out the study say they consider the people fat if they are in the top of 5% of the measurement in which weight is linked to height. For example, fat women in the study were about 160 centimeters tall and weighed about 90 kilograms. Fat men in the study were about 175 centimeters tall and weighed 100 kilograms. The researchers say that more than 1,000,000 Americans are that big. The researchers found that fat young women were from wealthy families. The fat women also were 20% less likely to get married and they earned an average of about $6,700 a year less than other women. The study showed less
effects on fat men. They earned an average of about $3,000 a year less than other men. Fat men also were 11% less likely to get married. 
 Question:The passage mainly tells us    _   . 
A. the standards of fat people 
B. the number of fat Americans 
C. fat people have fewer advantages 
D. how long is the study 
 Answer: C
Context: Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do. 
 Question:Ray Birdwhistell believes that physical appearance   _  . 
A. has little to do with culture 
B. has much to do with culture 
C. is ever changing 
D. is different from place to place

Context: Doctors in hospital emergency rooms often see accidental poisonings . A frightened parent arrives with a child who swallowed a cleaning liquid. Or perhaps the harmful substance is a medicine. Or it might be a chemical product meant to kill insects. These are common causes of accidental poisoning.
In cases like this, look for medical help as soon as possible. Save the container of whatever caused the poisoning. And look on the container for information about anything that stops the effects of the poison. Save anything expelled   from the mouth of the victim. That way, doctors can examine it.
In the past, some people forced poisoning victims to empty the stomach. They used a liquid syrup of ipecac   to do this. But an organization of children's doctors no longer advises parents to keep syrup of ipecac. The American Academy of Pediatrics says some poisons can cause additional damage when they come back up the throat.
Millions of people know a way to save a person who is choking on something trapped in the throat. The method is commonly known as the Heimlich Maneuver or abdominal thrusts. The American Red Cross says a rescuer should first hit the person on the back five times between the shoulder bones. These back blows may ease the choking. If the airway is still blocked, the Red Cross suggests pushing hard five times along the victim's abdomen. The abdomen is the area between the chest and the hip   bones. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the text? 
A. Learning the basics of first aid 
B. Accidental poisonings 
C. Common causes of accidental poisoning 
D. Poisonings and first aid

Context: We discuss the issue of when to help a patient die. Doctors of our generation are not newcomers to this question. Going back to my internship days, I can remember many patients in pain, sometimes in coma , with late, hopeless cancer. For many of them, we wrote an order for heavy medication--morphine by the clock. This was not talked about openly and little was written about it. It was essential, not controversial.
The best way to bring the problem into focus is to describe two patients whom I cared for. The first, formerly a nurse, had an automobile accident. A few days later her lungs seemed to fill up; her heart developed dangerous rhythm disturbances. So there she was: in coma, on a breathing machine, her heartbeat maintained with an electrical device. One day after rounds, my secretary said the husband and son of the patient wanted to see me. They told me their wife and mother was obviously going to die; she was a nurse and had told her family that she never wanted this kind of terrible death, being maintained by machines. I told them that while I respected their view, there was nothing deadly about her situation. The kidney  failure she had was just the kind for which the artificial kidney was most effective. While possibly a bit reassured, they were disappointed. Here was the head surgeon seemingly determined to keep everybody alive, no matter what.
Within a few days the patient's pacemaker  could be removed and she awoke from her coma. About six months later, the door of my office opened and in walked a gloriously fit woman. After some cheery words of appreciation, the father and son asked to speak to me alone. As soon as the door closed, both men became quite tearful. All that came out was, ""We want you to know how wrong we were.""
The second patient was an 85-year-old lady whose hair caught fire while she was smoking. She arrived with a deep burn; I knew it would surely be deadly. As a remarkable coincidence there was a meeting for discussion going on at the time in medical ethics . The speaker asked me if I had any sort of ethical problem I could bring up for discussion. I described the case and asked the students their opinion. After the discussion, I made a remark that was, when looking back, a serious mistake. I said, ""I'll take the word back to the nurses about her and we will talk about it some more before we decide."" The instructor and the students were shocked: ""You mean this is a real patient?"" The teacher of ethics was not accustomed to being challenged by actuality. In any event, I went back and met with the nurses. A day or two later, when she was making no progress and was suffering terribly, we began to back off treatment. Soon she died quietly and not in pain. As a reasonable physician, you had better move ahead and do what you would want done for you. And don't discuss it with the world first. There is a lesson here for everybody. Assisting people to leave this life requires strong judgment and long experience to avoid its misuse. 
 Question:The author suggested that doctors  _   before they assist a patient in killing himself. 
A. do what they are wanted to do

Context: Today, we know that the role of vitamins and minerals goes way beyond the prevention of deficiency diseases   to actually preventing cancer and heart disease, the most fearsome killers of our time. With this knowledge has come the widespread call for nutritional supplementation   -- and a confusing group of vitamin, mineral, and supplements lining the supermarket shelves.
Far from contributing to better health, however, nutritional supplements threaten to turn a scientific breakthrough into a nutritional disaster.
 _ of vitamins and minerals -- especially vitamins A, C, and E-- would have consumers believe that the little vitamin pill in the bottle is all they need for good health. Take your vitamins in the morning, and you're covered. It's okay to eat fast foods for the rest of the day or skip meals to achieve today's fashionably skinny look. But vitamins and minerals are only one part of the nutritional puzzle. A diet rich in fiber   and balanced in carbohydrates and protein is essential for good health. You can't get these things from a nutritional supplement. The focus on vitamin and mineral supplements may actually be robbing us of the full nutrition we seek.
And no supplement can compare to the quality of nutrition found in natural sources. For example, our bodies turn carotenes   from plant foods into vitamin A. Many supplements contain a single carotene, but natural sources are rich in many different carotenes. Many supplements contain a form of vitamin E that is made from chemicals, when natural vitamin E is more readily absorbed and used by the body. And science is still discovering the wealth of nutrients in foods.
You'd be hard-pressed to find a supplement as nutritionally comprehensive and powerful as a balanced diet. Even if you could, you'd pay much more than if you got the same nutritional value from natural sources.
But perhaps the greatest danger presented by nutritional supplements comes from the very real risks presented by self-medication. Anyone can walk into the market and buy as many different supplements as desired. The reported benefits of high dosages of certain nutrients have led some people to believe that the more the better. Many take several vitamin and mineral supplements without regard to possible consequences.
Surprising new research suggests that vitamin C pills may speed up hardening of the arteries, the underlying cause of heart attacks. Researchers said their findings support the recommendations of health organizations, which urge people to avoid high doses of supplements and to get their nutrients from food instead.
As appealing as they're made to sound, nutritional supplements are _ . If you're looking for good health, don't look on the supplement shelves of your supermarket. Look in the produce section instead. 
 Question:What has given rise to the great need for nutritional supplements? 
A. The knowledge of deficiency diseases. 
B. The low prices of nutritional supplements. 
C. The frighteningly high death rate from cancer and heart disease. 
D. The information about the role of vitamins and minerals in health. 
 Answer: D
Context: Plants need green leaves to make food. A plant needs sunlight and carbon dioxide  from the air for making food and it also needs water and salts from the soil to make food too. There are certain cells   in the leaves which change carbon dioxide and water into sugar. To do this the cells needs energy, which they get from the sunlight.
Green leaves make food for the whole plant. A red leaf can make food too because under the red color1ing of the leaf there are food----making cells. There are no leaves which are completely yellow, for they can't make food.
The plant makes sugar for its food. In sunlight green leaves make a lot of sugar. The veins   can't carry all this sugar away, so the leaves change the sugar into starch  , which is kept and so stored in the leaves. At night, the starch changes back to sugar. It is then carried away from the leaves. Some of the sugar is used as food by the plant while the rest is stored as starch. In some plants, food is stored in the roots, in others it is stored in the stem   and in leaves, fruits and seeds. 
 Question:Sugar is made for its food by   _  . 
A. sunlight 
B. veins 
C. stems 
D. green leaves 
 Answer: D
Context: Many jobs must be done with two people. One person takes the lead. The other helps. So it is with the human body. Much of our body depends on the cooperation between substances. When they work together, chemical reactions take place smoothly. Body systems are kept in balance.
Some of the most important helpers in the job of good health are the substances we call vitamins. The word ""vitamin"" dates back to Polish scientist Casimir Funk in 1912. He was studying a substance in rice. Funk believed the substance belonged to a group of chemicals known as amines  . He added the Latin word ""vita"", meaning life. So he called the substance a ""vitamine""--an amine necessary for life.
Other studies found that not all vitamins were amines. So the name was shortened to vitamin. But Funk was correct in recognizing their importance.
Scientists have discovered 14 kinds of vitamins. They say vitamins help to carry out chemicals changes within cells. If we do not get enough of the vitamins, we are at risk of developing a number of diseases. _ brings us back to James Lind of Scotland. In the 1740s, Lind was a doctor for the British Navy. He was investigating a problem that had existed in the Navy for many years.
The problem was the disease scurvy . The sailors were weak from bleeding inside their bodies. Even the smallest wound would not heal. Doctor Lind thought the sailors were getting sick because they failed to eat some kinds of foods when they were at sea for many months.
Doctor Lind separated twelve sailors who had scurvy into two groups. He gave each group different foods to eat. One group got oranges and lemons. The other did not. The men who ate the fruit began to improve within seven days. The other men got weaker.
However, which foods should be eaten to keep us healthy? Let us look at some important vitamins for these answers. 
 Question:Why was the name ""vitamine"" shortened to ""vitamin""? 
A. Because Funk was totally wrong. 
B. Because few vitamins were amines. 
C. Because there were new findings. 
D. Because the latter was easy to remember. 
 Answer: C
Context: The vitamins   are named by letters of the alphabet  . Vitamin A is needed by the eyes. There is Vitamin A in milk, butter, and green vegetables. It can be kept by the body.
Vitamin B cannot be kept. It must be supplied all the time by some of the food we eat.
Vitamin C is very important to the body. Without it men's teeth become loose   and their arms and legs get weak. Lemons  , oranges and tomatoes have Vitamin C in them.
Vitamin D is the sun vitamin. We get it in milk and eggs and from sunlight on our skin  . There are other Vitamins, but these A, B, C and D, are the most important. 
 Question:If somebody is near-eye sighted probably he needs   _  . 
A. Vitamin A 
B. Vitamins A and C 
C. Vitamin D 
D. Vitamin B

Context: Half of the world's population is affected by Asian monsoons , but monsoons are difficult to predict. American researchers have put together a 700-year record of the rainy seasons, which is expected to provide guidance for experts making weather predictions.
Every year, damp air masses,known as monsoon,produce large amounts of rainfall in India, East Asia, Northern Australia and East Africa. All this wet air is pulled in by a high pressure area over the Indian Ocean and a low pressure area to the south.
According to Edward Cook , a weather expert at Columbia University in New York., the complex nature of the climate systems across Asia makes monsoons hard to predict. In addition, climate records for the area are too recent and not detailed enough to be of much use. Therefore, he and a team of researchers spent more than fifteen years traveling across Asia, looking for trees old enough to provide long-term records. They measured the rings, or circles, inside thousands of ancient trees in more than 300 places.
Rainfall has a direct link to the growth and width of rings on some kinds of trees. The researchers developed a document they are calling a Monsoon Asia Drought Atlas. It shows the effect of monsoons over seven centuries, beginning in the 1300s.
Professor Cook says the tree-ring records show periods of wet and dry weather. ""If the monsoon basically fails or is a very weak one, the trees affected by monsoons at that location might put on a very narrow ring. But if the monsoon is very strong, the trees affected by that monsoon might put on a wide ring for that year. So, the wide and narrow ring widths of the chronology that we developed in Asia provide us with a measure of monsoon variability."" With all this information, researchers say they can begin to improve computer climate models for predicting the behavior of monsoons.
""There has been widespread famine and starvation and human dying in the past in large droughts. And on the other hand, if the monsoon is particularly heavy, it can cause extensive flooding."" said Eugene Wahl, a scientist with America's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""So, to get a sense of what the regional moisture patterns have been, dryness and wetness over such a long period of time in great detail, I would call it a kind of victory for climate science.""

Context: A new study shows that fat people in the United States suffer direct economic and social effects because of their size. The findings are from an 8-year study of about 100,000 people. The people who were studied were between the age of 18 and 24 when the research began.
The researchers who carried out the study say they consider the people fat if they are in the top of 5% of the measurement in which weight is linked to height. For example, fat women in the study were about 160 centimeters tall and weighed about 90 kilograms. Fat men in the study were about 175 centimeters tall and weighed 100 kilograms. The researchers say that more than 1,000,000 Americans are that big. The researchers found that fat young women were from wealthy families. The fat women also were 20% less likely to get married and they earned an average of about $6,700 a year less than other women. The study showed less
effects on fat men. They earned an average of about $3,000 a year less than other men. Fat men also were 11% less likely to get married.

Context: More and more scientific experiments prove that physical exercise can reduce the dangers of some illnesses in middle-aged persons.Exercise strengthens the heart muscle,reduces blood pressure and help to prevent muscles from changing into fat.Physical exercise is just as important for children.
Exercise and food affect growing speed in young lab animals.Baby mice start running as soon as they are big enough to use an exercise wheel in their cage.If  they get extra food and run a lot,they will grow as much as 1.5 times bigger than normal.
The same differences in growing speed might be found between active and inactive children.Physical exercise helps active children grow faster than inactive children.One experiment shows that the brains of the mice that had enough exercise weighed about 3%more than those of the mice that did not exercise The mice that exercised are much quicker to learn doing new exercise than the mice that did not exercise.
The results of the experiments suppose the theory that exercise can help babies learn to talk and walk sooner than expected.
The good effects of physical exercise are not limited to children and middle-aged people.Exercise continues to be an important part of our lives after we grow old.For example,people over 50 years old begin to lose calcium  from their bones,which get weaker and can break easily.Physical exercise,however,helps to strengthen the bones and to prevent them from losing calcium.Of course,old people can take medicines to prevent themselves from suffering from losing calcium.But the medicines they take increase the chance of developing some kind of cancer .So physical exercise is a much safer treatment . 
 Question:The passage tells people that_. 
A. only middle-aged persons can benefit from physical exercise 
B. physical exercise can do good to both the middle-aged and children 
C. people of different ages can all benefit from physical exercise 
D. physical exercise is the safest treatment for losing calcium 
 Answer: C
Context: What will man be like in the future -- in 5,000 or even 50,000 years from now? We can only make guesses, of course, but we can be sure that he will be different from what he is today, for man is slowly changing all the time.
Let us take an obvious example. Man, even five hundred years ago, was shorter than he is today. Now, on average, men are about three inches taller. Five hundred years is relatively a short period of time, so we may suppose that man will continue to grow taller. Again, in the modern world we use our brains a great deal. Even so, we still make use of only about 20% of the brain's capacity . As time goes on, however, we shall have to use our brains more and more, and finally we shall need our brains more and more, and finally we shall need larger ones! This is likely to bring a physical change too: the head, in particular the forehead, will grow larger.
Nowadays our eyes are in constant use. In fact, we use them so much that very often they become weaker and we have to wear glasses. But over long period of time it is likely that man's eyes will grow stronger.
On the other hand, we tend to make less use of our arms and legs. These, as a result, are likely to grow weaker. At the same time, however, our fingers will grow more sensitive because they are used a great deal in modern life.
But what about hair? This will probably disappear from the body altogether in course of time because it does not serve a useful purpose any longer. In the future, then, both sexes are likely to be bald.
Perhaps all this gives the impression that future man will not be a very attractive creature to look at! This may well be true. All the same, in spite of all these changes, future man will still have a lot in common with us. He will still be a human being, with thoughts and motions similar to our own. 
 Question:The passage mainly tells us that   _  . 
A. Man's life will be different in the future 
B. Future man will look quite different from us 
C. Man is growing taller and uglier as time passes 
D. Man's organs' functions will change

Context: Health experts have long worried about the increasing rate of obesity in kids. It's an important concern: Being weight or obese during childhood can lead to serious problems normally seen in adults, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Poor diets and a lack of exercise are usually the causes. But would you ever have imagined there might be a connection between the bacteria that lived in your guts  when you were a baby and the chance that you would become overweight?
Scientists in Finland recently found just such a link. In a recent study, they showed that overweight kids had different species of bacteria living in their guts.
You probably think of bacteria only as germs that can make you sick. While it's true that some bacteria can make people ill, your body actually depends on some types of bacteria to help you digest food and extract nutrients from it. These ""good"" bacteria live in your guts, where they process the food you eat.
Human babies get these bacterial helpers from their moms. When a baby is born, some of the bacteria in the mother move into the baby's body. Growing babies get additional ""good"" bacteria from the milk their mothers produce. And it turns out the bacteria might play an important role in regulating weight just six years later.
So how could these bacteria affect weight? The researchers still haven't tested that question, but future tests might lead to an answer. 
 Question:The purpose of writing this passage is to   _  . 
A. introduce the role of bacteria in children's weight 
B. analyze the influence of obesity on kids 
C. give advice on how to lose weight quickly 
D. explain the function of bacteria in foods

Context: Do you know you could get sick just by walking past a building? The bacteria  that cause Legionnaire's disease grow very fast in large modern buildings. They are carried by air through the buildings and outside. Legionnaire s disease is only one of the illnesses that are caused by ""sick buildings"".
Some buildings can make you ill because their heating and air-conditioning  are controlled . Air from outside cannot get in through the closed windows; This indoor air pollution is a growing problem.
Legionnaire's disease may be the most serious result of sick buildings, but other unpleasant illnesses can appear.People who work in some buildings suffer  from tiredness, feeling sick and headaches. Their offices look bright and clean, but invisible  and dangerous bacteria are in the air around them.
There is an answer to the problem. The air-conditioning and heating can be tested for bacteria. _ This is expensive to do, but the results are good. The people in the buildings no longer get sick, and everybody is happier. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE? 
A. Legionnaire's disease is only one of the results of ""sick buildings"". 
B. There is less and less indoor air pollution.

Context: *New labels to show calories
The US government ruled that all food establishments  should put the calorie information of their foods on their menus. Within a year chain restaurants, like fast food KFC, will have to say clearly on their menus how many calories their fried chicken wings, fries, and other items contain. Amusement parks, movie theaters and supermarkets will also have to follow the rules. The move is designed to fight against the problem of obesity  in the US.
* _ leading to world problem
The entire world is facing this problem: antibiotic resistance. And the resistance will lead to the deaths of 10 million people across the world by 2025, predicted a new report released by the UK government. Antibiotics are used to destroy or slow the growth of harmful bacteria in our bodies. But overuse and misuse of them can encourage bacteria to develop new ways of overcoming antibiotics, which makes it increasingly difficult for humans to fight diseases.

Australia is the world's most expensive destination for international students, according to a study done by Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC). They have to spend an average of $ 42,000 ( about 258 ,000 yuan) a year to study at Australian universities. Singapore is not far behind, with an average yearly cost of $ 39,229, followed by the US at $ 36,564 and the UK at 35,045. However, Australia's education quality only ranks joint fourth with Canada, well below the US, the UK, and Germany. In addition, international students studying in Germany only have to pay about one-sixth the cost of studying in Australia.

Context: It is generally believed that we are getting cleaned when we step under a shower. We are, but we're also giving a home to lots of tiny little creatures we didn't even know about. A showerhead carries thousands of bacteria called Mycobacterium.These can cause problems like coughs and tiredness, and a general feeling of poorliness  . When you turn on the water, the bacteria go from the showerhead onto and into your body.
This is a finding of Norman R. Pace and his team at the University of Colorado, in the US. The scientists investigated bacteria in all kinds of human environment, including showers.Pace's team looked at 45 showerheads in nine American cities. They discovered that 30 percent of them had large amounts of flying Mycobacterium.
But Pace said that they _ few threats to the health.Only those with a weak immune system might need to worry.He told the New York Times that the bacteria are not as unpleasant as might be thought.He said that having a shower is no more dangerous than anything else we do in the morning.
But for those who feel sick about the idea of all those microorganisms  , he had some advice. Let the water run for 30 seconds before getting into the shower. Why? The number of bacteria is smaller than that when the water is just turned on. If that seems like a waste of water, he added that you could also change your showerhead every few months.
However, Pace had good news too. He has also been testing the air in US subways. Apart from iron particles  , which are ground off the track by the wheels of trains, subway air is fresh. The reason is that a train's movement pumps fresh outdoor air into the tunnels.
Pace explained that he wanted to understand the natural microbial environments of public places. This kind of knowledge might help discover the microbes to be used in a bioterrorist   attack. 
 Question:From the finding of Norman R. Pace, after taking a shower, we might cough or feel tired because  _  . 
A. it's easy to get a cold when taking a bath 
B. the showerhead carries many bacteria causing illness 
C. we don't get cleaned while showering

Context: Scientists say they have discovered a promising treatment for sleeping sickness, a killer disease that infects  about 60,000 people in Africa a year.
British and Canadian experts say drugs could attack the parasite  causing the illness needs to survive. They say the drug could be ready for human medical test in about 18 months.
The disease, spread by the bite of a fly, is caused by a parasite attacking the central nervous system. It has similar symptoms  to malaria , making it difficult to diagnose. Left untreated, it moves to the brain, resulting in mental confusion and final death
The ""breakthrough"" came at the University of Dundee in Scotland, where scientists were offered money to research diseases ignored by major drugs companies.
Professor Paul Wyatt, director of the programme, said: ""This is one of the most significant findings made in recent years in terms of drug discovery and development for ignored diseases.""
He said the research, published in the journal Nature, represented ""significant progress"" in the development of a full blown drug against the disease.
The World Health Organization said there are between 50,000 and 70,000 cases of the disease a year, with a further 60 million people at risk of infection.
The research in Dundee was _ by partners at the University of York in England and the Structural Genomics Consortium in Toronto, Canada. The two drugs currently available to treat sleeping sickness both have problems. One is with side effects that kill one in 20 patients and the other is costly, only partially effective and requires long-time hospital treatment, the scientists said. 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that  _   . 
A. big drug companies play an important role in the research of the new drug 
B. people who get infected with the disease are mentally disturbed 
C. among 200 people infected with the disease, 5 may die because of the old drug

Context: According to the studies from the UN, the increase of CO2in the air is responsible for 85% of the temperature increase. CO2goes into the air when we burn fossil fuels to run our industries, cars and so on. Luckily, half of the CO2that we produced is taken in by plants, trees, land and the oceans. The rest gases are still large to cause worry. At the same time, we are cutting down forests that take in carbon from the air.
To solve the problem is not an easy job. Developed nations such as the USA, Germany and Australia will have to promise to cut down greenhouse gases by as much as 25-40%. Countries such as India and China that have a large population and growing industry, have to leave a smaller greenhouse gas footprint. Everybody must be active and stick to it. 
 Question:Why does the temperature increase? 
A. People use up useful gases. 
B. More and more CO
2goes into the air because of people's activities. 
C. Forests can not take in CO
2any more.

Context: It seems to be strange that there is a blind spot in the eye. Here is an interesting experiment   that can make something _ when one eye is open.
Make a card about the size of a postcard and write two English letters ""L"" and ""R"" on it. ""L"" is on the left and ""R"" on the right. First, hold the card about 80 cm away and you can see both the letters. Then close your right eye and look at the letter ""R"" only with your left eye. And now, as you move the card slowly towards you, you'll find the letter ""L"" disappearing. But if you move the card nearer to your face, the letter will be seen again. Now do the same experiment with your left eye closed; you'll find the letter ""R"" disappearing.
Why do the letters disappear? It is because there is a blind spot in the eye. When the image   of the letter falls on the blind spot, it won't be seen. That's why one of the letters disappears.

Context: Dr.Michael Prager, a leading Botox expert, said that a growing number of women are developing something called ""computer face"".He also mentioned that professionals who worked long hours in front of a screen were ending up with saggy jowls , ""turkey neck"" and deep-set wrinkles on their forehead and around their eyes.
The Botox expert said that, of all his clients, office workers were most likely to show premature signs of ageing.""If you are one of the unfortunate people who frown while you are concentrating on the screen then, over time, you will inevitably end up with frown lines,"" Dr.Prager said.""What is perhaps more surprising is the number of women with saggy jowls because they are sitting in one position for so long.If you spend most of the time looking down then the neck muscles shorten and go saggy, eventually giving you a second neck.""
Dr.Prager, who has a practice near Harley Street in London, said he encourages his clients to put a mirror next to their computer so they can see if they are frowning at the screen.""When people are stressed or thinking hard about something, then they will often put on a 'grumpy face' without even knowing what they are doing.When my clients put a mirror next to their desk, they are often shocked by the angry, frowning face which stares back at them.""
He said, ""The women I am seeing at the moment have only been using computers at work for the last decade or so.But women in their 20s have grown up with them and use them for every single task.I think the problem is going to become much, much worse.In another ten years, they could be looking quite awful.""
Dr.Prager said there were several simple steps which could avoid ""computer face"" such as regular screen breaks and stretching the neck muscles.And, of course, there was always Botox.He said that, after a couple of sessions of Botox, the habit of ""grumpy face"" could be broken. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the following are signs of ageing? 
A. Saggy jowls and short necks. 
B. Turkey neck and frown lines. 
C. Deep-set wrinkles and angry faces. 
D. Second neck and stressed muscles. 
 Answer: B
Context: Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do. 
 Question:Ray Birdwhistell believes that physical appearance   _  . 
A. has little to do with culture 
B. has much to do with culture 
C. is ever changing 
D. is different from place to place

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. ""

A. a close friend 
B. a stranger 
C. a classmate

Context: Malaria, the world's most widespread parasitic  disease, kills as many as three million people every year--almost all of whom are under five, very poor, and African. In most years, more than five hundred million cases of illness result from the disease, although exact numbers are difficult to assess because many people don't (or can't) seek care. It is not unusual for a family earning less than two hundred dollars a year to spend a quarter of its income on malaria treatment, and what they often get no longer works. In countries like Tanzania, Mozambique, and the Gambia, no family, village, hospital, or workplace can remain unaffected for long.
Malaria starts suddenly, with violent chills, which are soon followed by an intense fever and, often, headaches. As the parasites multiply, they take over the entire body. Malaria parasites live by eating the red blood cells they infect. They can also attach themselves to blood vessels in the brain. If it doesn't kill you, malaria can happen again and again for years. The disease passed on to humans by female mosquitoes infected with one of four species of parasite. Together, the mosquito and the parasite are the most deadly couple in the history of the earth--and one of the most successful. Malaria has five thousand genes, and its ability to change rapidly to defend itself and resist new drugs has made it nearly impossible to control. Studies show that mosquitoes are passing on the virus more frequently, and there are more outbreaks in cities with large populations. Some of the disease's spread is due to global warming.
For decades, the first-choice treatment for malaria parasites in Africa has been chloroquine, a chemical which is very cheap and easy to make. Unfortunately, in most parts of the world, malaria parasites have become resistant to it. Successful alternatives that help prevent resistance are already available, but they have been in short supply and are very expensive. If these drugs should fail, nobody knows what would come next.

Context: We discuss the issue of when to help a patient die. Doctors of our generation are not newcomers to this question. Going back to my internship days, I can remember many patients in pain, sometimes in coma , with late, hopeless cancer. For many of them, we wrote an order for heavy medication--morphine by the clock. This was not talked about openly and little was written about it. It was essential, not controversial.
The best way to bring the problem into focus is to describe two patients whom I cared for. The first, formerly a nurse, had an automobile accident. A few days later her lungs seemed to fill up; her heart developed dangerous rhythm disturbances. So there she was: in coma, on a breathing machine, her heartbeat maintained with an electrical device. One day after rounds, my secretary said the husband and son of the patient wanted to see me. They told me their wife and mother was obviously going to die; she was a nurse and had told her family that she never wanted this kind of terrible death, being maintained by machines. I told them that while I respected their view, there was nothing deadly about her situation. The kidney  failure she had was just the kind for which the artificial kidney was most effective. While possibly a bit reassured, they were disappointed. Here was the head surgeon seemingly determined to keep everybody alive, no matter what.
Within a few days the patient's pacemaker  could be removed and she awoke from her coma. About six months later, the door of my office opened and in walked a gloriously fit woman. After some cheery words of appreciation, the father and son asked to speak to me alone. As soon as the door closed, both men became quite tearful. All that came out was, ""We want you to know how wrong we were.""
The second patient was an 85-year-old lady whose hair caught fire while she was smoking. She arrived with a deep burn; I knew it would surely be deadly. As a remarkable coincidence there was a meeting for discussion going on at the time in medical ethics . The speaker asked me if I had any sort of ethical problem I could bring up for discussion. I described the case and asked the students their opinion. After the discussion, I made a remark that was, when looking back, a serious mistake. I said, ""I'll take the word back to the nurses about her and we will talk about it some more before we decide."" The instructor and the students were shocked: ""You mean this is a real patient?"" The teacher of ethics was not accustomed to being challenged by actuality. In any event, I went back and met with the nurses. A day or two later, when she was making no progress and was suffering terribly, we began to back off treatment. Soon she died quietly and not in pain. As a reasonable physician, you had better move ahead and do what you would want done for you. And don't discuss it with the world first. There is a lesson here for everybody. Assisting people to leave this life requires strong judgment and long experience to avoid its misuse. 
 Question:The author suggested that doctors  _   before they assist a patient in killing himself.

Context: In the past few years development in medical technology has made it possible for people to live longer than in the past. New medicines and machines are being developed every day to extend  life. However, some people, including some doctors, are not in favor of  these life extending measures, and they argue that people should have the right to die when they want to. They say that the quality of life is as important as life itself and that people should not be forced to go on living when conditions of life have become terrible. They say that people should be allowed to die with dignity   and to decide when they want to die. Others argue that life under any conditions is better than death and that the duty of doctors is always to extend life as long as possible. And so the argument goes on and on without a final answer. 
 Question:In recent years, people can live longer than in the past. It's because of   _   . 
A. the development of medical technology 
B. big hospitals 
C. good doctors

Context: Here is a question I have often asked at dinner parties:
You're on an island with only one other person, your best friend. He's dying of cancer. In his final days, he tells you, ""I have 100,000 dollars in a bank back home. When I die, make sure my son goes to medical school."" Then he dies. But his son is a no-good playboy who has no interest in going to medical school and will waste that money away in a very short time. But your son is entering college, and he is willing to become a doctor. Which one do you give the money to for medical school?
I've asked this question of everyone from the president of a famous university to an ordinary young soldier, and it has never failed to get a discussion going. Everyone has an opinion, most of them different, but all of them correct. Sometimes this one topic lasts the whole evening. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE to the passage? 
A. Only the clever people can answer the question rightly. 
B. Some people refuse to answer such a silly question. 
C. Everyone at the dinner party seems to be interested in the question. 
D. Most of the people have the same answer.

Context: Suppose a key man in your firm had just met with a terrible accident. The doctor tell you that this man upon whom you depend for directing sales, checking your books or for performing some other important roles, will be laid up for months, You'd have to replace him, wouldn't you? And probably at a pay about equal to his ?
Then you'd be faced with double paying for one job because stopping the pay of an injured man would simply be out of the question.
You can prevent this kind of unproductive outgo on your payroll by providing your key man with the protection of Travelers Business Accident Insurance!
This insurance provides total medical expense and a weekly income in case a key man is disabled for some time. Should the disability prove everlasting, an income for life is certainty. Why not make out a list of your key men now? Then get together with Travelers Insurance Company, and let us tell you how little it costs to apply this much needed protection to your business.

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle?

Context: Scientists have recently discovered that mothers tend to hold their baby on the left.Of 255 right-handed mothers,83% held the baby on the left.And out of 32 left-handed women,78%held the baby on the left As a control( ),women were watched coming from supermarkets carrying baby-sized bags;the bags were held with no side preference.
Then,dental   patients were given a large rubber ball to hold during treatment.The majority held the ball to their left side,even when it was interrupted with the dentist's activities.
This suggested that in times of stress objects are held against the left side.
At that point,something clearly contrary was observed.A large number of mothers who brought their premature babies to a clinic were seen to hold their babies against their right side.
So,115 mothers who had been separated from their babies for 24 hours after birth were observed for holding response.The experimenters presented the baby directly to midline of the mother's body, and noted how she held the baby.53% placed the baby on the left and 47% on the right.And it was also noted that the mothers of the group who had held their baby on the left had already had a baby from which they had not been separated after birth.
Left-handed holding enables the baby to hear the heartbeat.In order to discover whether hearing the heart has a beneficial effect on the baby,the sound of a human heart-beat was played to 102 babies in a New York nursery for 4 days.A control group of babies was not exposed to heart-beats.The babies in the heart-beat group gained more weight and cried far less than the babies in the control group. 
 Question:The experiments proved that_. 
A. mothers have an instinct to hold their babies on the left immediately after birth 
B. mothers hold their babies on the left in times of stress 
C. mothers of premature babies do not have the instinct to hold their babies on the left 
D. mothers find it more comfortable to carry their babies on the left because the heart is on that side

Context: A young father was visiting an old neighbor. They were standing in the old man's garden,and talking about children. The young man said,""How strict should parents be with their children?""
The old man pointed to a string between a big strong tree and a thin young one.""Please untie that string,"" he said.The young man untied it,and the young tree bent over to one side. ""Now tie it again,please,"" said the old man,""but first pull the string tight so that the young tree is straight again.""
The young man did so.Then the old man said,""There,it is the same with children.You must be strict with them,but sometimes you must untie the string to know how they are getting on. If they are not yet able to stand alone,you must tie the string tight again.But when you find that they are ready to stand alone,you can take the string away."" 
 Question:The young man untied the string   _  . 
A. in order to throw it away

 Answer: C
Context: If a diver surfaces too quickly, he may suffer the bends. Nitrogen   dissolved   in his blood is suddenly liberated by the reduction of pressure. The consequence, if the bubbles   accumulate in a joint, is sharp pain and a bent body -- thus the name. If the bubbles form in his lungs or brain, the consequence can be death.
Other air-breathing animals also suffer this decompression   sickness if they surface too fast: whales, for example. And so, long ago, did ichthyosaurs  . That these ancient sea-animals got the bends can be seen from their bones. If bubbles of nitrogen form inside the bone they can cut off its blood supply. This kills the cells in the bone, and consequently weakens it, sometimes to the point of collapse. Fossil bones that have caved in on themselves are thus a sign that the animal once had the bends.
Bruce Rothschild of the University of Kansas knew all this when he began a suty of ichthyosaurs bones to find out how widespread the problem was in the past. What he particularly wanted to investigate was how ichthyosaurs adapted to the problem of decompession over the 150 milllion years. To this end, he and his colleagues traveled the world's natural-history museums, looking at hundreds of ichthyosaurs from the Trassic period and from the later Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
When he started, he assumed that signs of the bends would be rarer in younger fossils, reflecting their gradual evolution of measures to deal with decompression. Instead, he was astonished to discover the opposite. More than 15% of Jurassic and Cretaceous ichthyosaurs had suffered the bends before the died, but not a single Trassic specimen showed evidence of that sort of injury.
If ichthyosaurs did evolve an anti-decompression means, they clearly did so quickly -- and, most strangly, they lost it afterwards. But that is not what Dr Rothchild thinks happened. He suspects it was evolution in other animals that caused the change.
Whales that suffer the bends often do so because they have sufaced to escape a predator   such as a large shark. One of the features of the Jurassia oceans was an abundance of large sharks and crocodiles, both of which were fond of ichthyosaurs lunches. Trassic oceans, by contrast, were mercifully shark-and crocodile-free. In the Trassic, then, ichthyosaurs were top of the food chain. In the Jurrasic and Cretaceous, they were prey   as well as predator --and often had to make a speedy exit as a result. 
 Question:Rothchild's finding stated in Paragrapg 4  _  . 
A. confirmed his assumption 
B. speeded up his research process 
C. disagreed with his assumption 
D. changed his research objectives

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. ""

Context: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog.
Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation.
""The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,"" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery.
The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are ""extremely difficult, if not impossible"" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said.
The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face.
The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants,
Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue.
Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality
There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers.
Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant. 
 Question:The best title for the passage would be   _  . 
A. French Woman has First Partial Face Transplant 
B. First Face Transplant Opens Debate 
C. Risks and Ethical Problems of a Face Transplant

Context: For centuries, medical pioneers have refined a variety of methods and medicines to treat sickness, injury, and disability, enabling people to live longer and healthier lives.
""A salamander (a small lizard-like animal) can grow back its leg. Why can't a human do the same?"" asked Peruvian-born surgeon Dr. Anthony Atala in a recent interview. The question, a reference to work aiming to grow new limbs for wounded soldiers, captures the inventive spirit of regenerative medicine. This innovative field seeks to provide patients with replacement body parts.
These parts are not made of steel; they are the real things --- living cells, tissue, and even organs.
Regenerative medicine is still mostly experimental, with clinical applications limited to procedures such as growing sheets of skin on burns and wounds. One of its most significant advances took place in 1999,when a research group at North Carolina's Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine conducted a successful organ replacement with a laboratory-grown bladder. Since then, the team, led by Dr. Atala, has continued to generate a variety of other tissues and organs  from kidneys to ears.
The field of regenerative medicine builds on work conducted in the early twentieth century with the first successful transplants of donated human soft tissue and bone. However, donor organs are not always the best option. First of all, they are in short supply, and many people die while waiting for an available organ; in the United States alone, more than 100,000 people are waiting for organ transplants. Secondly, a patient's body may ultimately reject the transplanted donor organ. An advantage of regenerative medicine is that the tissues are grown from a patient's own cells and will not be rejected by the body's immune system.
Today, several labs are working to create bioartificial body parts. Scientists at Columbia and Yale Universities have grown a jawbone and a lung. At the University of Minnesota, Doris Taylor has created a beating bioartificial rat heart. Dr. Atala's medical team has reported long-term success with bioengineered bladders implanted into young patients with spina bifida (a birth defect that involves the incomplete development of the spinal cord). And at the University of Michigan, H. David Humes has created an artificial kidney.
So far, the kidney procedure has only been used successfully with sheep, but there is hope that one day similar kidney will be implantable in a human patient. The continuing research of scientists such as these may eventually make donor organs unnecessary and, as a result, significantly increase individuals' chances of survival. 
 Question:Why is generative medicine considered innovative? 
A. It will provide patients with replacement soft tissues. 
B. It will strengthen the human body's immune system. 
C. It will shorten the time patients waiting for a donated organ. 
D. It will make patients live longer with bioartificial organs.

Context: A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations.
Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital.
Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. ""We were desperate,"" said Matouk.
The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. ""We are very satisfied with the results,"" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital.
Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians in transplant surgery at the Royal Liverpool. ""Funding is a problem,"" said Hammad. ""In the meantime we'll go back as volunteers to Gaza for the next couple of years to do more transplants."" The Liverpool team's next visit is scheduled for May. 
 Question:What is the beginning of the cooperation between the Royal Liverpool hospital and Gaza? 
A. A UK doctor contacted Gaza hospital. 
B. The Shifa imported medical machines from UK. 
C. Ziad Matouk's condition seemed to get worse. 
D. A Shifa doctor turned to Royal Liverpool hospital for help.

Context: Scientists say they have discovered a promising treatment for sleeping sickness, a killer disease that infects  about 60,000 people in Africa a year.
British and Canadian experts say drugs could attack the parasite  causing the illness needs to survive. They say the drug could be ready for human medical test in about 18 months.
The disease, spread by the bite of a fly, is caused by a parasite attacking the central nervous system. It has similar symptoms  to malaria , making it difficult to diagnose. Left untreated, it moves to the brain, resulting in mental confusion and final death
The ""breakthrough"" came at the University of Dundee in Scotland, where scientists were offered money to research diseases ignored by major drugs companies.
Professor Paul Wyatt, director of the programme, said: ""This is one of the most significant findings made in recent years in terms of drug discovery and development for ignored diseases.""
He said the research, published in the journal Nature, represented ""significant progress"" in the development of a full blown drug against the disease.
The World Health Organization said there are between 50,000 and 70,000 cases of the disease a year, with a further 60 million people at risk of infection.
The research in Dundee was _ by partners at the University of York in England and the Structural Genomics Consortium in Toronto, Canada. The two drugs currently available to treat sleeping sickness both have problems. One is with side effects that kill one in 20 patients and the other is costly, only partially effective and requires long-time hospital treatment, the scientists said.

Context: There are some strong-minded people that are able to stop smoking today and be free from the addiction the next day. However, some smokers may have to seek help from medication   in order to kick the habit.
     What medication actually does is to reduce the wish to smoke. Some of the medication must be taken with a doctor's guidance. The five most common medications to stop smoking are Bupropion SR, nicotine gum, nicotine inhalers, nicotine nasal spray and nicotine patches. People can buy nicotine gum and nicotine patches in chemists. However, the other medications require a prescription.
     Zyban tablets have been found to be highly effective in curing people of smoking addiction. The tablet needs to be taken whole, without crushing  it, as crushing can lead to side effects. It can be bought on the prescription of a doctor.
     Nicotine patches are filled with nicotine and they are applied to the skin. The skin takes in the nicotine and carries it to the blood stream. The amount of nicotine in these patches is quite limited, not enough to lead to addiction. But you shouldn't take them for dinner. In fact, millions of people have benefited from these nicotine patches.
     Nicotine gum is supposed to be a safer choice. It is used in such a way that it comes into contact with the blood vessels   in the mouth and then releases the nicotine. The nicotine should not go through the stomach; otherwise, it may cause certain side effects.
     These different types of medications have to be taken quite carefully. Do ask your doctor before taking any of these. 
 Question:Medication can   _  . 
A. weaken smokers' wish to smoke 
B. clear away the nicotine in smokers' bodies 
C. only be taken on the prescription of a doctor 
D. stop people from becoming addicted to smoking

Context: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog.
Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation.
""The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,"" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery.
The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are ""extremely difficult, if not impossible"" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said.
The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face.
The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants,
Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue.
Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality
There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers.
Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant. 
 Question:The best title for the passage would be   _  . 
A. French Woman has First Partial Face Transplant 
B. First Face Transplant Opens Debate 
C. Risks and Ethical Problems of a Face Transplant 
D. A Complete Face Transplant of a French Woman 
 Answer: A
Context: Full face transplants are no longer science fiction fantasy, a leading surgeon has said, adding that they are technically feasible but ethically complex.
       Peter Butler from London's Royal Free Hospital called for a debate on the ethics of such an operation made possible by new drugs whichstop the body's immune system rejecting a transplanted face. ""It is not 'Can we do it?' but 'Should we do it?'"" he told the BBC.""The technical part is not complex, but I don't think that's going to be the very great difficulty. The ethical and moral debate is obviously going to have to take place before the first facial transplantation.""
      The British Association of Plastic Surgeons will discuss the microsurgical procedure  , which could give new skin, bone, noses, chin, lips and ears from  _ donors to patients disfigured by accidents, burns or cancer. But surgeons could have trouble finding enough willing donors. prefix = st1 /Butlersaid his survey of doctors, nurses and members of the public showed most would accept a face transplant but few were willing to donate their own after dying.
       Despite a number of ethical concerns, Christine Piff, who founded the charity Let's Face It after suffering a rare facial cancer 25 years ago, welcomed the possibility of face transplants. She rejected the idea that the procedure would mean people would end up living with a dead person's face. ""There are so many people without faces, I have half a face... but we are all so much more than just a face... you don't take on their personality. You are still you,"" she told reporters. ""If we can donate other organs of the body, then why not the face? I can't see anything wrong with it.""

Context: Darek Fidyka, a 38-year-old Bulgarian, had been paralyzed   from the chest down for four years after a knife attack. Scientists from Britain and Poland took cells from his nose, transplanted   them into his back and re-grew his spinal cord  . Now he can walk and even drive a car. The doctors were delighted but said it was the first step in a long journey.
The breakthrough came after 40 years of research by Professor Geoff Raisman, who found that cells had the possibility to repair damage to nasal   nerves, the only part of the nervous system that constantly re-grows. ""The idea was to take something from an area where the nervous system can repair itself and put it into an area that doesn't repair itself,"" Professor Raisman said.
Polish doctors injected   the nasal cells into Mr Fidyka's spinal cord above the injury and used some nerves from his ankle to form a bridge across the damaged tissue. The nasal cells appear to have caused the spinal nerves to repair themselves.
Professor Raisman achieved this with rats in the late 1990's, but this is his greatest success. ""I think the moment of discovery for me was Christmas in 1997 when I first saw a rat, which couldn't control its hand, put its hand out to me. That was an exciting moment, because I realized then that my belief that the nervous system could be repaired was true.""
Doctors chose the easiest case for their first attempt--it might not work for others. But there is a real sense of hope that an idea once thought impossible has been realized.
David Nicholls, who helped provide money for the breakthrough, said information about the breakthrough would be made available to researchers across the globe.
""What you've got to understand is that for three million paralyzed people in the world today, the world looks a totally brighter place than it did yesterday,"" he said. 
 Question:What made Professor Geoff Raisman begin to believe the nervous system can be repaired?

Context: For almost forty years the Empire State Building in New York City was the world's tallest skyscraper . The building reaches a height of 1, 250 feet. It has 102 floors. The use of steel frames made its height possible. Steel walls can rise height without needing to be thick. Steel frame construction is strong. All plates are fixed firmly together by metal bolts called rivets  . When set in place, rivets are usuall red- hot. One end is already rounded. A riveter uses a special hammer to shape the other end. Then the rivet cools. It holds the plates firmly. High winds can move this strong building. A wind of a hundred miles an hour has caused it to move almost one and a half inches.

Context: Have you ever seen a horse with toes ?Millions of years ago, horses had many toes. They had four toes on each front foot. They had three toes on each back foot. The horses were no bigger than the cats.These small horses lived in the forest. The toes helped the horses run on the soft, wet ground.
At first, it was very hot in the forest. But the weather changed. It became very cold. Many trees could not live in cold weather. The trees died and fell. Open fields took the place of forests. The sun made the ground dry and hard.
Horsed began to change, too. They began to get bigger. This took a long time. On the dry, hard land, horses needed only their middle toes for running. Their middle toes became hard. After a long time, horses had only one hard toe on each foot. Now we call this hard toe a

 Answer: A
Context: If a diver surfaces too quickly, he may suffer the bends. Nitrogen   dissolved   in his blood is suddenly liberated by the reduction of pressure. The consequence, if the bubbles   accumulate in a joint, is sharp pain and a bent body -- thus the name. If the bubbles form in his lungs or brain, the consequence can be death.
Other air-breathing animals also suffer this decompression   sickness if they surface too fast: whales, for example. And so, long ago, did ichthyosaurs  . That these ancient sea-animals got the bends can be seen from their bones. If bubbles of nitrogen form inside the bone they can cut off its blood supply. This kills the cells in the bone, and consequently weakens it, sometimes to the point of collapse. Fossil bones that have caved in on themselves are thus a sign that the animal once had the bends.
Bruce Rothschild of the University of Kansas knew all this when he began a suty of ichthyosaurs bones to find out how widespread the problem was in the past. What he particularly wanted to investigate was how ichthyosaurs adapted to the problem of decompession over the 150 milllion years. To this end, he and his colleagues traveled the world's natural-history museums, looking at hundreds of ichthyosaurs from the Trassic period and from the later Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
When he started, he assumed that signs of the bends would be rarer in younger fossils, reflecting their gradual evolution of measures to deal with decompression. Instead, he was astonished to discover the opposite. More than 15% of Jurassic and Cretaceous ichthyosaurs had suffered the bends before the died, but not a single Trassic specimen showed evidence of that sort of injury.
If ichthyosaurs did evolve an anti-decompression means, they clearly did so quickly -- and, most strangly, they lost it afterwards. But that is not what Dr Rothchild thinks happened. He suspects it was evolution in other animals that caused the change.
Whales that suffer the bends often do so because they have sufaced to escape a predator   such as a large shark. One of the features of the Jurassia oceans was an abundance of large sharks and crocodiles, both of which were fond of ichthyosaurs lunches. Trassic oceans, by contrast, were mercifully shark-and crocodile-free. In the Trassic, then, ichthyosaurs were top of the food chain. In the Jurrasic and Cretaceous, they were prey   as well as predator --and often had to make a speedy exit as a result. 
 Question:Rothchild's finding stated in Paragrapg 4  _  . 
A. confirmed his assumption 
B. speeded up his research process 
C. disagreed with his assumption 
D. changed his research objectives

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle? 
 Answer: A
Context: An exercise method (Gyrotonics) designed to stretch muscles and improve strength and balance is becoming popular in the United States. Here's more about Gyrotonics and the man who invented this special form of exercise.
Gyrotonics is a kind of exercise that combines the movements of dancing and swimming with the mental and physical practice called yoga. It helps lengthen muscles, improve balance, and exercise the joints, the parts of the body where bones are joined.
A Hungarian dancer named Juliu Horvath developed this special form of exercise. After he was injured in dancing, Mr. Horvath studied yoga intensely. In the 1980s, he developed a new exercise method as a special kind of yoga to strengthen dancers.
According to Mr. Horvath, his method was based on the octopus ,monkey and cat. He says these animals have no restrictions. They can move in any direction the Gyrotonic movements to help the human body move more freely.
A special machine made of wood and weights  helps guide the body through the Gyrotonics exercises. You sit or lie on a flat board. You put your legs or hands through special cloth handles attached to a line with weights. With the tension created by the weights, you must try to move through the exercises.
Seven kinds of backbone movements form the base of Gyrotonics. For example, you can stretch your back to the left and right or forward and backward. While moving your back, you can also work on arm or leg motions. These movements must be done in a smooth way. Often the motions are circular . 
When Juliu Horvath first developed Gyrotonics, he was the only teacher. Since then, he has taught almost 70 trainers. Now, there are more then 800 official schools in the world where you can learn Gyrotonics.

Context: With the press of a button, a person with severe spinal cord  injuiy is able to walk again, thanks to the Walking Assistive Exoskeleton Robot (WAER).
Powered suits that could help paralyzed  people walk and others lift and carry heavy loads with ease have been a dream since late 19th century. But they can realize their dreams in the 21st century.
The 20-kilogram robot has four battery-powered motors that can run for up to three hours. Inventor Wu Chenghua, from Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute, says it has successfully been in tests on 12 patients. ""We have learned from our research process that patients whose injuries are below the fourth chest joint  are able to use our robot to stand, walk and sit down,"" he said.
Since walking contributes to muscle exercise, Wu says patients receive some additional benefits. ""In the clinical process, we would check their bone mineral density  ,and we found that the bone mineral densities of these patients had been improved."" he said. Wu says his exoskeleton may be available for consumers by 2018.
Meanwhile, baggage handlers at Tokyo's Haneda Airport will soon start testing a similar robot, developed by the Japanese firm Cyberdyne. The battery-powered robot weighs only 3

We believe that it will change the life of paralyzed people in many ways and have a promising future.""

Context: On Nov.18,1995,Itzhak Perlman,the violinist,came on stage to give a concert at Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center in New York City.
If you have ever been to a Perlman concert, _ him.He was stricken with polio as a child,and so he has braces on both legs and walks with the aid of two crutches .
He walks painfully, yet majestically, until he reaches his chair.Then he sits down,slowly, puts his crutches on the floor, undoes the clasps on his legs,tucks one foot back and extends the other foot forward.Then he bends down and picks up the violin, puts it under his chin,nods to the conductor and proceeds to play.
But this time,something went wrong.Just as he fmished the first few bars ,one of the strings on his violin broke.You could hear it snap ---it went off like gunfire across the room.There was no mistaking what that meant.There was no mistaking what he had to do.
We figured that he would have to get up,put on the clasps again,pick up the crutches and limp his way off stage-to either find another violin or else find another string for this one.But he didn't.Instead.he waited a moment,closed his eyes and then signaled the conductor to begin again.

B. give up playing 
C. change or repair his violin 
D. get off the stage with shame 
 Answer: C
Context: On Nov.18,1995,Itzhak Perlman,the violinist,came on stage to give a concert at Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center in New York City.
If you have ever been to a Perlman concert, _ him.He was stricken with polio as a child,and so he has braces on both legs and walks with the aid of two crutches .
He walks painfully, yet majestically, until he reaches his chair.Then he sits down,slowly, puts his crutches on the floor, undoes the clasps on his legs,tucks one foot back and extends the other foot forward.Then he bends down and picks up the violin, puts it under his chin,nods to the conductor and proceeds to play.
But this time,something went wrong.Just as he fmished the first few bars ,one of the strings on his violin broke.You could hear it snap ---it went off like gunfire across the room.There was no mistaking what that meant.There was no mistaking what he had to do.
We figured that he would have to get up,put on the clasps again,pick up the crutches and limp his way off stage-to either find another violin or else find another string for this one.But he didn't.Instead.he waited a moment,closed his eyes and then signaled the conductor to begin again.
The orchestra began,and he played from where he had left off.And he played with such passion and such power and such purity as they had never heard before.
When he finished, there was an awesome silence in the room.And then people rose and cheered.He smiled,wiped the sweat from this brow, raised his bow to quit us,and then he said in a quiet tone.""You know, sometimes it is the artist's task to find out how much music you can still make with what you have left.'' 
 Question:Itzhak Perlman can be best described as a man who is  _  . 
A. clever 
B. strong willed 
C. humourous 
D. quite skilled 
 Answer: B
Context: Darek Fidyka, a 38-year-old Bulgarian, had been paralyzed   from the chest down for four years after a knife attack. Scientists from Britain and Poland took cells from his nose, transplanted   them into his back and re-grew his spinal cord  . Now he can walk and even drive a car. The doctors were delighted but said it was the first step in a long journey.
The breakthrough came after 40 years of research by Professor Geoff Raisman, who found that cells had the possibility to repair damage to nasal   nerves, the only part of the nervous system that constantly re-grows. ""The idea was to take something from an area where the nervous system can repair itself and put it into an area that doesn't repair itself,"" Professor Raisman said.
Polish doctors injected   the nasal cells into Mr Fidyka's spinal cord above the injury and used some nerves from his ankle to form a bridge across the damaged tissue. The nasal cells appear to have caused the spinal nerves to repair themselves.
Professor Raisman achieved this with rats in the late 1990's, but this is his greatest success. ""I think the moment of discovery for me was Christmas in 1997 when I first saw a rat, which couldn't control its hand, put its hand out to me. That was an exciting moment, because I realized then that my belief that the nervous system could be repaired was true.""
Doctors chose the easiest case for their first attempt--it might not work for others. But there is a real sense of hope that an idea once thought impossible has been realized.
David Nicholls, who helped provide money for the breakthrough, said information about the breakthrough would be made available to researchers across the globe.
""What you've got to understand is that for three million paralyzed people in the world today, the world looks a totally brighter place than it did yesterday,"" he said. 
 Question:What made Professor Geoff Raisman begin to believe the nervous system can be repaired? 
A. His former study with other people. 
B. His operation on a paralyzed patient. 
C. His sudden thought about Christmas. 
D. His unusual experience with a sick rat. 
 Answer: D
Context: If a diver surfaces too quickly, he may suffer the bends. Nitrogen   dissolved   in his blood is suddenly liberated by the reduction of pressure. The consequence, if the bubbles   accumulate in a joint, is sharp pain and a bent body -- thus the name. If the bubbles form in his lungs or brain, the consequence can be death.
Other air-breathing animals also suffer this decompression   sickness if they surface too fast: whales, for example. And so, long ago, did ichthyosaurs  . That these ancient sea-animals got the bends can be seen from their bones. If bubbles of nitrogen form inside the bone they can cut off its blood supply. This kills the cells in the bone, and consequently weakens it, sometimes to the point of collapse. Fossil bones that have caved in on themselves are thus a sign that the animal once had the bends.
Bruce Rothschild of the University of Kansas knew all this when he began a suty of ichthyosaurs bones to find out how widespread the problem was in the past. What he particularly wanted to investigate was how ichthyosaurs adapted to the problem of decompession over the 150 milllion years. To this end, he and his colleagues traveled the world's natural-history museums, looking at hundreds of ichthyosaurs from the Trassic period and from the later Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
When he started, he assumed that signs of the bends would be rarer in younger fossils, reflecting their gradual evolution of measures to deal with decompression. Instead, he was astonished to discover the opposite. More than 15% of Jurassic and Cretaceous ichthyosaurs had suffered the bends before the died, but not a single Trassic specimen showed evidence of that sort of injury.
If ichthyosaurs did evolve an anti-decompression means, they clearly did so quickly -- and, most strangly, they lost it afterwards. But that is not what Dr Rothchild thinks happened. He suspects it was evolution in other animals that caused the change.
Whales that suffer the bends often do so because they have sufaced to escape a predator   such as a large shark. One of the features of the Jurassia oceans was an abundance of large sharks and crocodiles, both of which were fond of ichthyosaurs lunches. Trassic oceans, by contrast, were mercifully shark-and crocodile-free. In the Trassic, then, ichthyosaurs were top of the food chain. In the Jurrasic and Cretaceous, they were prey   as well as predator --and often had to make a speedy exit as a result.

Context: We all know that eating junk food can make us fat. However, a new study suggests that it can do more than that - it can also make us lazy, reported CBS News.
In the study, researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, US divided 32 female rats into two groups. The first group was fed a diet of healthy food such as corn and fish, while the second was given a diet of highly processed   food rich in sugar, namely ""junk food"".
Within three months, the rats in the second group were already much fatter than those on the healthy diet. And when researchers trained the rats to do simple tasks, they found even more differences between the two groups rather than weight.
During the task - pushing a lever   to receive a reward of sugar water - the rats on the junk food diet were found to be less willing to move, and they took longer breaks between each push than the lean rats did.
""It is as if the rat is thinking 'This is too much work',"" Aaron Blaisdell, leader of the study, told the Los Angeles Times.
But what about the possibility that the fat rats were less passionate about getting sugar water because they were already eating lots of sugar in their daily diet? That's why researchers repeated the tests by rewarding fat rats with plain water when they were extremely thirsty. However, the results came out just the same.
According to researchers, these differences suggest that junk food changed the chemistry in the rats' brains.
The experiment didn't end _ . After six months, the rats' diets were switched, and the overweight rats were given a healthy diet for nine days. However, this change didn't help reduce their weight or improve their ability to perform tasks, which means the effects of their junk food diet persisted  . ""There's no quick fix,"" said Blaisdell.
For a long time, we've believed that people become fat because they are lazy. But this study has proven the opposite to be true as well, which indicates that laziness and obesity are a ""vicious cycle  "".
So, if you constantly feel tired, lacking any urge to get up from your chair, it could be that you've been studying too hard. But you should also pay attention to your diet. 
 Question:Which of the following is Not Right according to the passage? 
A. Eating junk food can make us fat. 
B. Researchers got different results after repeated the tests to fat rats. 
C. For a long time, we've believed that people become fat because they are lazy.

Context: Children whose parents live well into their 80s seem to have healthier hearts in middle age compared with children whose parents did not live this long. Moreover, the heart advantage continues over time, which should help them follow in their parents' footsteps.
The findings come from the Framingham Heart Study, a study relating to several generations on risk factors for heart disease and other diseases among residents of prefix = st1 /Framingham,Massachusetts.
The worst Framingham Risk Scores - a measure of heart disease risk that uses age, smoking, and blood pressure to estimate a person's possibility of suffering a heart attack - were found in children whose parents had both died before age 85. The best risk scores were found among children whose parents had both lived to age 85 or older.

 Answer: D
Context: Chinese officials yesterday urged employers to take more measures to protect workers against workplace diseases and injuries.
Experts estimate  that about 200 million workers face a potential danger of occupational diseases and work-related injuries.
The majority of them are farmers-turned-workers who are working in small or medium-sized firms.
One of the most serious workplace diseases on the Chinese mainland is pneumoconiosis, a lung disease that is caused by breathing in too much dust of coal, silicon, and cerement. It causes serious breathing difficulties and can be fatal .
The disease killed 966 people in the country last year, according to an official report released by the Ministry of Health yesterday.
From the early 1950s until the end of last year, 607,570 people were diagnosed with pneumoconiosis.
Among the number, 137,481 people died from the disease.
Chen Xiaohong, vice minister of health, said the general level of prevention and control of workplace diseases is still quite low in China.
""Health authorities  at various levels will do more education work in the future to raise employers` awareness that they are the first person responsible for any workplace diseases or accidents,"" Chen said.
He made the remark at a ceremony held by his ministry and other relevant departments under the State Council to award prizes to 56 companies which have done well in protecting workers` health.
On the Chinese mainland, more than 16 million companies are engaged in potentially dangerous sectors, such as coal mining, construction, and those that use chemicals, according to the Ministry of Health.
Although many companies, especially large foreign-invested and State-owned ones, have done well in protecting workers` health, many employees are still working in dangerous places with poor protection and without any insurance support.
At least 90 per cent of Chinese companies are small or medium-sized organizations.
Many of these companies, especially private ones based in towns and villages, do not want to spend their money strengthening workplace protection against various diseases and injuries, or buying insurance  policies for their employees.
According to statistics  from Chinese labour and social welfare authorities, there are about 120 million farmers-turned-workers working in Chinese cities. Less than 10 per cent of them have medical or injury insurance and many have no contracts  with employers.
According to Chinese law on preventing occupational diseases, employers should establish qualified working conditions before opening factories, buy insurance policies for their workers, and provide regular health examinations for labourers.
However, according to a survey last year of 74,946 companies that use chemicals or are based in ""dangerous sectors,"" only about 50 per cent offered health tests for workers. 
 Question:From the passage, we can infer  _  . 
A. Chinese law on preventing occupational diseases has worked well. 
B. the workers` awareness of protecting themselves has been greatly raised. 
C. much remains to be done to protect the workers from workplace diseases. 
D. the workers themselves are responsible for any workplace diseases or accidents.

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle?

Context: Recently hand-foot-mouth disease has spread across China. In the past three months, there have been about 41,846 cases   in 30 provinces and regions. The number is increasing. Eighteen Chinese children have died of the disease so far this year.
What causes the disease and why is it dangerous?
Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common childhood illness. It mainly affects children under the age of 10. It gets its name from the rash   that develops on the hands and feet. It can also cause blisters   in your mouth.
A child who has the disease will usually have a fever, a runny nose and sore throat. He or she doesn't want to eat or drink because of pain in the mouth.
Hand-foot-mouth disease is mostly not serious. The fever and rash clear within a few days. But in some cases, the virus   affects the heart, lungs or brain. This puts the child's life in danger.
A virus causes hand-foot-mouth disease. The disease spreads easily where a lot of young children are together, such as in a child-care center. Sometimes it can also affect teenagers and adults.
In order not to pass on the virus, good hygiene   is important. We should wash our hands as often as possible. Especially we should wash our hands before meals and after going to the toilet. 
 Question:_   can help us to keep away from the hand-foot-mouth disease. 
A. Passing on the virus 
B. Taking children to the child-care center 
C. Keeping your hands clean 
D. Not going to public places

Context: Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do. 
 Question:Ray Birdwhistell believes that physical appearance   _  . 
A. has little to do with culture 
B. has much to do with culture 
C. is ever changing 
D. is different from place to place

Context: Dr.Michael Prager, a leading Botox expert, said that a growing number of women are developing something called ""computer face"".He also mentioned that professionals who worked long hours in front of a screen were ending up with saggy jowls , ""turkey neck"" and deep-set wrinkles on their forehead and around their eyes.
The Botox expert said that, of all his clients, office workers were most likely to show premature signs of ageing.""If you are one of the unfortunate people who frown while you are concentrating on the screen then, over time, you will inevitably end up with frown lines,"" Dr.Prager said.""What is perhaps more surprising is the number of women with saggy jowls because they are sitting in one position for so long.If you spend most of the time looking down then the neck muscles shorten and go saggy, eventually giving you a second neck.""
Dr.Prager, who has a practice near Harley Street in London, said he encourages his clients to put a mirror next to their computer so they can see if they are frowning at the screen.""When people are stressed or thinking hard about something, then they will often put on a 'grumpy face' without even knowing what they are doing.When my clients put a mirror next to their desk, they are often shocked by the angry, frowning face which stares back at them.""
He said, ""The women I am seeing at the moment have only been using computers at work for the last decade or so.But women in their 20s have grown up with them and use them for every single task.I think the problem is going to become much, much worse.In another ten years, they could be looking quite awful.""
Dr.Prager said there were several simple steps which could avoid ""computer face"" such as regular screen breaks and stretching the neck muscles.And, of course, there was always Botox.He said that, after a couple of sessions of Botox, the habit of ""grumpy face"" could be broken. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the following are signs of ageing? 
A. Saggy jowls and short necks. 
B. Turkey neck and frown lines. 
C. Deep-set wrinkles and angry faces. 
D. Second neck and stressed muscles.

Context: There are various reasons why cancers appear to be on the increase. For one thing, though their sufferers are to be found in all age groups, cancers are particularly likely to attack persons in their middle and advanced years. Naturally, since people live longer these years, there are more cancer sufferers than before. Again, with better methods of diagnosis  , doctors can more easily recognize cancerous growths that would formerly have passed unnoticed or that would have been wrongly diagnosed. It is also believed that certain habits and conditions of modern living, including heavy smoking and the pollution of the air, may leave people living in more cancer-causing conditions than before.
We all look forward to the day when a simple medical test can find cancer while it is still small. Researchers around the world are working on _ . Most of their work deals with the examination of the blood.
Researchers in Boston have found something in the blood of cancer patients that does not appear in healthy persons. The test showed which persons had cancer and which did not. It was correct more than 90 percent of the time.
The researchers believe the test may be able to show cancer very clearly in its development. Cancers discovered early usually can be treated successfully.
The test examines very small bits of fat in the blood called lipids  . Cancers seem to change lipids although doctors do not know why. The test showed differences between the lipids of the persons with cancer and the lipids of those without cancer.
The researchers say the new test could be a step to develop a simple way to check patients for cancer before the disease shows on an X-ray. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. A simple way to cancer 
B. Cancers can be cured 
C. How to find cancer 
D. Early discovery of cancer

Context: A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations.
Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital.
Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. ""We were desperate,"" said Matouk.
The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. ""We are very satisfied with the results,"" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital.
Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians in transplant surgery at the Royal Liverpool. ""Funding is a problem,"" said Hammad. ""In the meantime we'll go back as volunteers to Gaza for the next couple of years to do more transplants."" The Liverpool team's next visit is scheduled for May. 
 Question:What is the beginning of the cooperation between the Royal Liverpool hospital and Gaza? 
A. A UK doctor contacted Gaza hospital. 
B. The Shifa imported medical machines from UK. 
C. Ziad Matouk's condition seemed to get worse. 
D. A Shifa doctor turned to Royal Liverpool hospital for help.

Context: One Monday morning, Paul and his classmates were in science laboratory for their practical chemistry lesson. The students were going to work in pairs to do an experiment. Before they began, the teacher gave them this description of the different stages of the experiment.
Stage 1: Prepare the equipment: a test tube, a crucible, a Bunsen burner and tongs.
Stage 2: Weigh 5 grams of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and put it in a crucible.
Stage 3: Heat 10 ml of hydrochloric acid   in a test tube.
Stage 4: Pour the warm acid onto the baking soda and continue to heat the mixture.
Result: The acid reacts with the bicarbonate to form water, carbon dioxide gas and salt. The hotter the mixture, the quicker the reaction. Continue to heat the mixture until the water evaporates, leaving the salt in the crucible.
Paul and his partner followed the instructions and set up their equipment. Paul went to the cupboard to get a bottle of hydrochloric acid. He found that there was only one bottle in the cupboard so he took that. There was no label on the bottle and Paul didn't check with the teacher if it was the right solution.
He measured the liquid and poured it into a test tube. Using tongs to hold the test tube, he heated it over the Bunsen burner. That's when things started to go wrong. The liquid in the test tube was not hydrochloric acid. When it was heated, it formed a thick cloud of white gas. Soon the room was full of this strong smelling white gas.
All the students started coughing and their eyes hurt. The teacher immediately opened the windows and ordered the students to leave the laboratory at once. She realized that the liquid was a crylamide   and that it is poisonous.
Fortunately, nobody was injured in the incident. However, it taught the students and the teacher a good lesson. 
 Question:What substance were the students making in the experiment? 
A. Water 
B. Carbon dioxide gas 
C. Salt 
D. Poisonous gas

Context: Scientists are making new studies of color and its effects on our health. They have known for a long time that the color of a room or the color of the light in it can affect our feelings and emotions. Many prisons and hospitals have at least one room that is painted pink. Officials have found that light and color can produce physical changes in our bodies.
Professor Falfan worked with a group of 9 disabled children at school in Albert. Two of the children were blind. The other seven had normal sight. The scientists changed the color of the school room, then looked for changes in blood pressure, heart beat and breathing rate. The effects of color changes were the same for the blind children as for those with normal sight. Their blood pressure dropped from about 120 to 100. Similar changes were reported in heart-beat and the breathing. The children also were calmer and less excited. Then the colors of the room were returned to orange and white. Blood pressure, heart-beat and breathing rate went up and the children became excited again.
Professor Falfan said different colors produce different levels of light energy. He said the differences seem to affect chemicals in the brain that carry messages from nerve to nerve and from nerve to muscle. 
 Question:The color of pink had a calming effect, that is to say, the color affects   _  . 
A. the chemicals in the brain

Context: Far from the land of Antarctica, a huge shelf of ice meets the ocean. At the underside of the shelf there lives a small fish, the Antarctic cod.
For forty years scientists have been curious about that fish. How does it live where most fish would freeze to death? It must have some secret. The Antarctic is not a comfortable place to work and research has been slow. Now it seems we have an answer.
Research was begun by cutting holes in the ice and catching the fish. Scientists studied the fish's blood and measured its freezing point.
The fish were taken from seawater that had a temperature of -1.88degC and many tiny pieces of ice floating in it. The blood of the fish did not begin to freeze until its temperature was lowered to -2.05degC. That small difference is enough for the fish to live at the freezing temperature of the ice-salt mixture.
The scientists' next research job was clear: Find out what in the fish's blood kept it from freezing. Their search led to some really strange thing made up of a protein never before seen in the blood of a fish. When _ was removed, the blood froze at seawater temperature. When it was put back, the blood again had its antifreeze quality and a lowered freezing point.
Study showed that it is an unusual kind of protein. It has many small sugar molecules held in special positions within each big protein molecule. Because of its sugar content, it is called a glycoprotein. So it has come to be called the antifreeze fish glycoprotein. Or AFGP. 
 Question:What is the text mainly about? 
A. The terrible conditions in the Antarctic. 
B. A special fish living in freezing waters. 
C. The ice shelf around Antarctica. 
D. Protection of the Antarctic cod.

Context: Warm water freezes   more quickly than cold water. Sir Francis Bacon said that almost four hundred years ago. But few people believed him until 1970. In that year Canadian scientist Geoge Kell proved   the English physicist was right. Dr Kell filled one open bowl   with cold water. He filled another with warm water. He put both bowls to the same low temperature. The warm water froze   first.
The lack   of covers on the bowls was the secret  . Some of the warm water changed into vapor.   It evaporated   into the air. This meant that less of the warm water was left to freeze. And so the warm water froze faster than the cold water. 
 Question:Warm vapor can't freeze faster if the bowls are   _  . 
A. full 
B. covered 
C. put outside 
D. changed 
 Answer: B
Context: Besides providing an ideal environment for sea plants and animals to live in, seawater has other values, one of which is that it constantly moves, and its movements produce energy.
The most obvious movements are waves and the tides. Winds causes the waves, and the gravitational pull of the moon and the son causes tides. In places like the Bay of Fundy in Canada, the difference between the high and low tide level can be as much as 40 feet.
France and Britain are now trying to use energy in the tides to produce electricity. Waves can produce electricity and some experiments are taking place to learn more about this. One of the most encouraging areas of research uses the difference between the temperature of seawater at the surface and deep down to produce electricity. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the following is not true? 
A. The temperature difference of seawater can produce electricity. 
B. The energy in the tides can produce electricity. 
C. Waves can produce electricity. 
D. The plants and animals in the ocean can produce electricity. 
 Answer: B
Context: According to the studies from the UN, the increase of CO2in the air is responsible for 85% of the temperature increase. CO2goes into the air when we burn fossil fuels to run our industries, cars and so on. Luckily, half of the CO2that we produced is taken in by plants, trees, land and the oceans. The rest gases are still large to cause worry. At the same time, we are cutting down forests that take in carbon from the air.
To solve the problem is not an easy job. Developed nations such as the USA, Germany and Australia will have to promise to cut down greenhouse gases by as much as 25-40%. Countries such as India and China that have a large population and growing industry, have to leave a smaller greenhouse gas footprint. Everybody must be active and stick to it. 
 Question:Why does the temperature increase? 
A. People use up useful gases. 
B. More and more CO
2goes into the air because of people's activities. 
C. Forests can not take in CO
2any more. 
D. Everybody hopes winter can be warm.

Context: A new study shows that fat people in the United States suffer direct economic and social effects because of their size. The findings are from an 8-year study of about 100,000 people. The people who were studied were between the age of 18 and 24 when the research began.
The researchers who carried out the study say they consider the people fat if they are in the top of 5% of the measurement in which weight is linked to height. For example, fat women in the study were about 160 centimeters tall and weighed about 90 kilograms. Fat men in the study were about 175 centimeters tall and weighed 100 kilograms. The researchers say that more than 1,000,000 Americans are that big. The researchers found that fat young women were from wealthy families. The fat women also were 20% less likely to get married and they earned an average of about $6,700 a year less than other women. The study showed less
effects on fat men. They earned an average of about $3,000 a year less than other men. Fat men also were 11% less likely to get married. 
 Question:The passage mainly tells us    _   . 
A. the standards of fat people 
B. the number of fat Americans 
C. fat people have fewer advantages 
D. how long is the study

Context: Here is a story told about an American general who was a very important figure in the American army during the First World War. Everybody in the United States knew him and many people wished to have a picture or something of his in their homes.
Soon after the war the general returned to Washington. One day he went to a dentist and had six teeth pulled out. A week later the general heard that his teeth were being sold in curiosity shops as $ 5 each. On each of the teeth there was a label with the name of the general and words: ""Buy these teeth and show them to your friends at home."" The general got angry. He rushed to his office and ordered six officers to go around the city and buy all his teeth.
The officers went out and visited every curiosity shop in the capital. They were away from the office all day. In the evening they returned and put on the table in front of the general the teeth they had bought. They had collected 175 teeth. 
 Question:The general returned to Washington   _  .

Context: In 1859, prefix = st1 /ItalyandFrancewere at war withAustria, and Henry Dunant, a young Swiss gentleman, came upon one of their battlefields. For the first time in his life, Dunant saw how heartless war would be. Around him were suffering men untended and left to die where they fell.
Henry Dunant went to work at once. Helped by several peasant women, he formed an ambulance service and set up headquarters in a little church. He treated the wounds of Frenchmen, Italians and Austrians alike. When he was asked why he did so, his answer showed a spirit of humanity that was not common in those days. ""We are all brothers. A wounded enemy is an enemy no longer."" With his band of assistants, Dunant helped to save many lives. The ""gentleman in white"" (as Dunant was called because he wore a white suit) was looked upon by hundreds of wounded men as an angel.
    When Dunant returned toSwitzerland, he could not forget the needless suffering on the battlefield. He thought of a great organization that should be planned to include many nations. It would do its work with the approval of all countries. And it must operate under a sign that all would know: its symbol would be a red cross against a white background.
He wrote a book to make the public see the need for this great organization. In the book he included a truthful account of what he had seen on the battlefield. The consequence was that readers were shocked by what he described.
After Dunant's hard work, in Geneva on October 26, 1863, all the nations of Europe were invited to a meeting at which it was decided a relief society should be formed in each country. Then the Geneva Convention was made the following year. The nations that signed the Geneva Convention chose the red cross as the symbol for the international organization.
    Until his death in 1910, Dunant was always ready to look for a noble cause. And when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded for the first time in 1901, the honor went to Dunant. No man has deserved it more than the founder of the Red Cross. 
 Question:Why was Dunant looked upon as an angel by wounded men? 
A. Because he really came from the heaven to help. 
B. Because he wore a white suit. 
C. Because he helped to save many lives. 
D. Because he was good-looking.

Context: A ""secret"" message, unseen for almost 150 years and making the start of the U.S. Civil War (1861-1865), has been uncovered in Abraham Lincoln's gold pocket watch, prefix = st1 /U.S.media reported on Wednesday.
""Lincolnnever knew of the message he carried in his pocket,"" Brent D. Glass, director of the National Museum of American History said in a statement.
The message, which was engraved by an Irish immigrant and watchmaker named Jonathan Dillon, is dated April 13, 1861, and reads in part: ""FortSumpter[sic] was attacked by the rebels"" and ""thank God we have a government.""
""It's a personal side of history about an ordinary watchman being inspired to record something for  _ ,"" Glass said.
The museum decided to open the watch after being contacted by the watchmaker's great-great-grandson, Doug Stiles, who had received a letter from a   in Ireland. It said that the family had found a letter Dillon had written about the purported   message in the watch.
Then Stiles, a 57 -year-old real estate lawyer in Waukegan,Illinois, searched on the Internet and found a New York Times article from 1906, where Dillon told the story at the age of 84.
During the interview, Dillon said that he unscrewed the dial of the watch and wrote on the metal as soon as he heard the news about the first shot of the Civil War. ""The first gun is fired. Slavery is dead. Thank God we have a President who at least will try.""
However, the actual message that the museum found is different from what Dillon recalled. It reads, ""Jonathan Dillon, April 13-1861, Fort Sumpter [sic] was attacked by the rebels on the above date J Dillon, April 13 -1861, Washington, thank God we have a government, Jonth Dillon.""

Context: The World Health Organization recently reported that the number of cases of tuberculosis(TB) has been _ since 2006 . Also, fewer people are dying from TB. But a study by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, says smoking could threaten this progress.
Nearly twenty percent of all people use tobacco, and millions of non-smokers get sick from breathing the smoke. The new study predicts that smoking will produce an additional thirty-four million TB deaths by 2024.
Efforts to control the spread of TB have mainly focused on finding and treating infections. Fewer efforts have been made to understand the causes. Dr Anthony Fauci is the director of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases. He said, ""Despite our control efforts, we still have more than a million people each year dying from TB and millions of people  getting infected; we realize it's still a very important problem. So we have to do the practical thing and we have to do the fundamental research things at the same time. ""
Smoking does not cause TB; bacteria cause the infection. But the study says smoking affects the nervous system in a way that makes an inactive case of TB more likely to develop into an active one. Stanton Glantz is the director of the University of California's Centre for Tobacco Control Research and Education and an author of the new study. He says it shows that TB cannot be controlled unless tobacco use is controlled.  He said, ""It increases the number of people who will get TB by about seven percent.""
The study is described as the first to identify a direct link between tobacco use and rates of TB infection and death. Professor Glantz says the results should guide those creating health policies and TB control efforts. He said, ""If you want to control the infectious disease of TB, you have to control the tobacco industry and the tobacco industry's efforts to increase tobacco use, particularly in developing countries where TB is a big problem."" 
 Question:What would Dr Anthony Fauci probably agree with? 
A. More efforts are needed to find the causes of TB infections. 
B. TB infections are no longer a serious problem. 
C. Few efforts have been put into the work of treating TB infections. 
D. The practical and the fundamental research cannot be done together at present. 
 Answer: A
Context: There are some strong-minded people that are able to stop smoking today and be free from the addiction the next day. However, some smokers may have to seek help from medication   in order to kick the habit.
     What medication actually does is to reduce the wish to smoke. Some of the medication must be taken with a doctor's guidance. The five most common medications to stop smoking are Bupropion SR, nicotine gum, nicotine inhalers, nicotine nasal spray and nicotine patches. People can buy nicotine gum and nicotine patches in chemists. However, the other medications require a prescription.
     Zyban tablets have been found to be highly effective in curing people of smoking addiction. The tablet needs to be taken whole, without crushing  it, as crushing can lead to side effects. It can be bought on the prescription of a doctor.
     Nicotine patches are filled with nicotine and they are applied to the skin. The skin takes in the nicotine and carries it to the blood stream. The amount of nicotine in these patches is quite limited, not enough to lead to addiction. But you shouldn't take them for dinner. In fact, millions of people have benefited from these nicotine patches.
     Nicotine gum is supposed to be a safer choice. It is used in such a way that it comes into contact with the blood vessels   in the mouth and then releases the nicotine. The nicotine should not go through the stomach; otherwise, it may cause certain side effects.
     These different types of medications have to be taken quite carefully. Do ask your doctor before taking any of these. 
 Question:Medication can   _  . 
A. weaken smokers' wish to smoke 
B. clear away the nicotine in smokers' bodies 
C. only be taken on the prescription of a doctor 
D. stop people from becoming addicted to smoking

Context: Many jobs must be done with two people. One person takes the lead. The other helps. So it is with the human body. Much of our body depends on the cooperation between substances. When they work together, chemical reactions take place smoothly. Body systems are kept in balance.
Some of the most important helpers in the job of good health are the substances we call vitamins. The word ""vitamin"" dates back to Polish scientist Casimir Funk in 1912. He was studying a substance in rice. Funk believed the substance belonged to a group of chemicals known as amines  . He added the Latin word ""vita"", meaning life. So he called the substance a ""vitamine""--an amine necessary for life.
Other studies found that not all vitamins were amines. So the name was shortened to vitamin. But Funk was correct in recognizing their importance.
Scientists have discovered 14 kinds of vitamins. They say vitamins help to carry out chemicals changes within cells. If we do not get enough of the vitamins, we are at risk of developing a number of diseases. _ brings us back to James Lind of Scotland. In the 1740s, Lind was a doctor for the British Navy. He was investigating a problem that had existed in the Navy for many years.
The problem was the disease scurvy . The sailors were weak from bleeding inside their bodies. Even the smallest wound would not heal. Doctor Lind thought the sailors were getting sick because they failed to eat some kinds of foods when they were at sea for many months.
Doctor Lind separated twelve sailors who had scurvy into two groups. He gave each group different foods to eat. One group got oranges and lemons. The other did not. The men who ate the fruit began to improve within seven days. The other men got weaker.
However, which foods should be eaten to keep us healthy? Let us look at some important vitamins for these answers. 
 Question:Why was the name ""vitamine"" shortened to ""vitamin""? 
A. Because Funk was totally wrong. 
B. Because few vitamins were amines. 
C. Because there were new findings. 
D. Because the latter was easy to remember. 
 Answer: C
Context: When a caterpillar   feeds on a tomato leaf , the plant moves rapidly to meet with a defensive response , systematically releasing "" proteinase inhibitors "" -- proteins that interfere   with the caterpillar's digestion -- throughout the plant , especially in the leaves .  But how does the message get from the wounded leaf to the rest of the plant ?
       Most scientists believed the alarm was spread by chemical messengers until a team of researchers headed by David Weldon-- a biologist at the University of East Anglia in Norwich , England -- made a shocking discovery .  An injured leaf , the researchers found , sends an electrical signal to warn neighboring leaves of upcoming danger . It's a "" terribly tiny current "" driven by an electrical potential difference of only 20 millvolts   , says Weldon , who measured the voltage after electrodes were attached to the plant's surface .  
       "" Right now , all we can say is that there is a correlation , "" Weldon notes . "" If you wound the plant , you'll see an electrical signal accompanied by a biochemical response . "" To learn more about the reaction , Weldon's team plans to insert electrodes within the pant tissue ( rather than on the surface ) to determine what's going on at the cellular level . The findings may help explain other mysteries surrounding plants . For example , many plants start to flower in springtime , as days grow longer , but plants sense the change in the day length through their leaves , while flowers begin to bloom at the buds   .  "" There must be a signal from the leaf to the growing points , "" Weldon says . "" So far , no one has come up with a convincing chemical mechanism . Maybe an electrical signal is involved . "" 
 Question:What is the function of the "" proteinase inhibitors "" in tomato plants ? 
A. They create nutritional matter 
B. They produce electrical signals 
C. They protect the plant from insects 
D. They cure diseases by changing chemicals 
 Answer: C
Context: Women are friendly. But men are more competitive. Why? Researchers have found it's all down to the hormone oxytocin . Although known as the love hormone, it affects the sexes differently.
""Women tend to be social in their behavior. They often share with others. But men tend to be competitive. They are trying to improve their social status,"" said Professor Ryan.
Generally, people believe that the hormone exytocin is let out in our body in various social situations and our body creates a large amount of it during positive social interaction such as falling in love or giving birth.
But in a previous experiment Professor Ryan found that the hormone is also let out in our body during negative social interactions such as envy.
Further researches showed that in men the hormone oxytocin improves the ability to recognize competitive relationships, but in women it raises the ability to recognize friendship.
Professor Ryan's recent experiment used 62 men and women aged 20 to 37.
Half of the participants received oxytocin. The other half received placebo . [( )] [( :Love my Dog.)] 
After a week, the two groups switched with participants. They went through the same procedure with the other material.
Following each treatment, they were shown some video pictures with different social interactions. Then they were asked to analyze the relationships by answering some questions. The questions were about telling friendship from competition. And their answers should be based on gestures, body language and facial expressions.
The results indicated that, after treatment with oxytocin, men's ability to correctly recognize competitive relationships improved, but in women it was the ability to correctly recognize friendship that got better.
Professor Ryan thus concluded: ""Our experiment proves that the hormone oxytocin can raise people's abilities to better distinguish different social interactions. And the behavior differences between men and women are caused by biological factor that are mainly hormonal."" 
 Question:Why did Professor Ryan conduct the recent experiment? 
A. To test the effect of oxytocin on the ability to recognize social interactions. 
B. To know the differences between friendship and competition. 
C. To know people's different abilities to answer questions. 
D. To test people's understanding of body language.

Context: Every year, World Blood Day is celebrated by blood services worldwide on 14 June, the birthday of Nobel Prize winner Karl Landsteiner, the man who discovered the ABO blood group system. If you have every thought of becoming a blood donor, just register to do it. And you should never worry about the donation.
Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body.
It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients.
First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday.
Although most people are able to give blood, some people who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease are no tasked to be donors. Pregnant women or those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood.
Blood has a very short shelf life. Some blood components can be kept longer than others, for instance red blood cells will keep for 35 days but platelets for only five. Remember, you should wait at least 16 weeks before donating blood again. 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that  _  . 
A. whole blood is most widely used in hospital 
B. platelets can be kept for more than 10 days 
C. people can donate their blood four times a years 
D. people can donate at most 470 ml of blood each time

 Answer: A
Context: Women who own cats are more likely to have mental health problems and kill themselves because they can be infected by a common parasite that can be caught from cat litter, a study has found.
Researchers found women infected with the Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) parasite , which is spread through contact with cat waste or eating undercooked meat or unwashed vegetables, are at increased risk of attempting suicide.
The study involved more than 45,000 women in Denmark. About a third of the world's population is infected with the parasite, which hides in cells in the brain and muscles, often without producing symptoms.
The infection, which is called toxoplasmosis , has been linked to mental illness, such as schizophrenia , and changes in behavior.
The study's senior author Doctor Teodor Postolache, an associate professor of psychiatry  at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in the United States, said, ""We can't say with certainty that T. gondii caused the women to try to kill themselves, but we did find a predictive association between the infection and suicide attempts later in life that deserves additional studies.""
Doctor Albert Reece, vice president of medical affairs at the University of Maryland, said, ""T. gondii infection is a major public health problem around the world, and many people don't realize they're infected.
""Dr Postolache is a leading expert on suicide neuroimmunology . Suicide is a critically important mental health issue. About one million people commit suicide and another 10 million attempt suicide worldwide each year. We hope that this type of research will one day help us find ways to save many lives that now end too early in suicide.""
Dr. Postolache's research team at the University of Maryland was the first to report a connection between T. gondii and suicidal behavior in 2009. He is cooperating with researchers in Denmark, Germany and Sweden to confirm and investigate the way leading to this association.
The T. gondii parasite thrives in the intestines of cats, and it is spread through their waste. All warm-blooded animals can become infected through contact with it. Humans can become infected by changing their infected cats' litter boxes, eating unwashed vegetables, drinking water from a polluted source, or by eating undercooked or raw meat.
Not washing kitchen knives after preparing raw meat before handling another food item also can lead to infection. Pregnant women can pass the parasite directly to their unborn babies and are advised not to change cat litter boxes to avoid possible infection.
Babies don't produce antibodies to T. gondii for three months after they are born, so the antibodies present in their blood represented infection in the mothers. The scientists studied Danish health patients to determine if any of these women later attempted suicide, including cases of violent suicide attempts which may have involved guns, sharp instruments and jumping from high places.
The study found that women infected with T. gondii were one and a half times more likely to attempt suicide compared to those who were not infected, and the risk seemed to rise with increasing levels of the T. gondii antibodies.
Dr Postolache noted limitations to the study, such as the inability to determine the cause of the suicidal behavior.
The findings were published online in the Archives of General Psychiatry. 
 Question:The objects of the research are women from   _  . 
A. Demark 
B. the USA 
C. Germany 
D. Sweden

Not washing kitchen knives after preparing raw meat before handling another food item also can lead to infection. Pregnant women can pass the parasite directly to their unborn babies and are advised not to change cat litter boxes to avoid possible infection.
Babies don't produce antibodies to T. gondii for three months after they are born, so the antibodies present in their blood represented infection in the mothers. The scientists studied Danish health patients to determine if any of these women later attempted suicide, including cases of violent suicide attempts which may have involved guns, sharp instruments and jumping from high places.
The study found that women infected with T. gondii were one and a half times more likely to attempt suicide compared to those who were not infected, and the risk seemed to rise with increasing levels of the T. gondii antibodies.
Dr Postolache noted limitations to the study, such as the inability to determine the cause of the suicidal behavior.
The findings were published online in the Archives of General Psychiatry. 
 Question:What is the consequence if a woman is infected with the parasite in the passage? 
A. Having a high fever. 
B. Doing deliberate self-harm. 
C. Keeping a depressed mood. 
D. Becoming bad tempered.

Context: You may get a cold sometimes. It often starts with a sore throat. You sneeze   and your nose runs. You usually have a headache, too. Often you have a cough later. It's not a serious illness, but you may feel quite bad.
 _ For example, you can take aspirin   to get rid of   your headache. It is good to rest and drink a lot of water, too. A doctor once told me, ""With the right medicine, the cold will last for seven days. With no medicine, it will go on for a week!""
Where does our medicine come from? A long time ago, people knew that some plants made them feel better. For example, the juice of lemons   makes a sore throat better. Now, scientists find some parts of plants can make some medicine. Because of these medicines, people now live longer than their grandparents.

Context: A single night of taking the drug Ecstasy   can cause serious brain damage and speed up the start of Parkinson's disease , scientists say. Just two or three Ecstasy tablets can permanently destroy brain cells that affect movement and reasoning, according to American research that links the drug to Parkinson's for the first time.
A study by a team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, involving squirrel monkeys and baboons   found that both species suffered permanent damage to key cells, which are lost in Parkinson's, after receiving three low doses of Ecstasy at three-hour periods.
The study is particularly important because baboons are one of the best animal models for the human brain. George Ricaurte, who led the research, said that the widespread abuse of drug might have caused severe damage. ""The most troubling result is that young adults using Ecstasy may be increasing their risk of developing Parkinsonism as they get older.""
Alan Leshner, a former director of the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, said, ""This study emphasizes the multi-aspect damage that Ecstasy causes to users. We've long known that repeated use damages brain cells. But this study shows that even very occasional  use can have long-lasting effects on many different brain systems. It sends an important message to young people: don't experiment with your own brain.""
Janet Betts, a mother whose teenage daughter Leah died after a single Ecstasy tablet in 1995, said, ""This comes as no surprise. But people can't see the effects at first, and they say it won't happen to them. We'll see the symptoms later, just as we have with smoking."" 
 Question:The article is intended to   _  . 
A. explain the bad effects of drugs on people's health 
B. warn young people of the risk of taking the drug Ecstasy 
C. persuade people out of such bad habits as smoking and using drugs 
D. tell us the links between the drug Ecstasy and the animal models

Context: Darek Fidyka, a 38-year-old Bulgarian, had been paralyzed   from the chest down for four years after a knife attack. Scientists from Britain and Poland took cells from his nose, transplanted   them into his back and re-grew his spinal cord  . Now he can walk and even drive a car. The doctors were delighted but said it was the first step in a long journey.
The breakthrough came after 40 years of research by Professor Geoff Raisman, who found that cells had the possibility to repair damage to nasal   nerves, the only part of the nervous system that constantly re-grows. ""The idea was to take something from an area where the nervous system can repair itself and put it into an area that doesn't repair itself,"" Professor Raisman said.
Polish doctors injected   the nasal cells into Mr Fidyka's spinal cord above the injury and used some nerves from his ankle to form a bridge across the damaged tissue. The nasal cells appear to have caused the spinal nerves to repair themselves.
Professor Raisman achieved this with rats in the late 1990's, but this is his greatest success. ""I think the moment of discovery for me was Christmas in 1997 when I first saw a rat, which couldn't control its hand, put its hand out to me. That was an exciting moment, because I realized then that my belief that the nervous system could be repaired was true.""
Doctors chose the easiest case for their first attempt--it might not work for others. But there is a real sense of hope that an idea once thought impossible has been realized.
David Nicholls, who helped provide money for the breakthrough, said information about the breakthrough would be made available to researchers across the globe.
""What you've got to understand is that for three million paralyzed people in the world today, the world looks a totally brighter place than it did yesterday,"" he said. 
 Question:What made Professor Geoff Raisman begin to believe the nervous system can be repaired? 
A. His former study with other people. 
B. His operation on a paralyzed patient. 
C. His sudden thought about Christmas. 
D. His unusual experience with a sick rat.

Context: Read the following interview with Dr John Bass, an international shark  specialist who has spent many years studying sharks:
First of all, doctor, are all sharks dangerous?
  No, they aren't. There are about 250 different kinds of sharks, but fewer than 30 of them are dangerous to humans. Certain sharks are very aggressive   and we should fear them, but the danger of shark attacks is much lower than most people think.
  So which sharks are dangerous?
  The Great White shark is the most dangerous. Then there is the Tiger shark, which other sharks are afraid of, and the Blue shark. Both of them are very fast and dangerous.
  Which are the biggest and smallest sharks?
  The Whale shark is the biggest shark in the world. It grows up to 15 m in length and weighs as much as six large cars. The smallest shark, which is found near prefix = st1 /Japan, could fit into the palm of your hand because it is only 15-20 cm long.
  Do all sharks have teeth ?
  Yes, they do. Most sharks have hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of sharp teeth. These are arranged in rows of four or more. They fit quite loosely in the jaw. When the front ones break off or fall out, spare teeth move forwards from the rows behind: Sharks get a new set of teeth every two weeks. In 10 years, a Tiger may lose as many as 24,000 teeth!
  That's lots of teeth! What kind of food do sharks eat?
  Most sharks feed on small fish, and they keep the oceans healthy by eating sick and injured fish. However, hungry sharks will eat almost anything, including smaller sharks and even rubbish. Inside one Tiger shark which was found, there was a tin can, a bicycle tyre , a leather wallet and an alarm clock!
  And how do sharks find their food, doctor?
  A shark's sense of smell is excellent. It will follow the smell of blood across thousands of metres of ocean. They also see well, and they have good hearing. Sharks can feel movement in water very easily too, and it is possible for them to feel a fish moving as far as 30 m away. 
 Question:Most types of sharks are   _  . 
A. dangerous killers 
B. not dangerous 
C. afraid of people 
D. found inJapan

Context: Recently hand-foot-mouth disease has spread across China. In the past three months, there have been about 41,846 cases   in 30 provinces and regions. The number is increasing. Eighteen Chinese children have died of the disease so far this year.
What causes the disease and why is it dangerous?
Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common childhood illness. It mainly affects children under the age of 10. It gets its name from the rash   that develops on the hands and feet. It can also cause blisters   in your mouth.
A child who has the disease will usually have a fever, a runny nose and sore throat. He or she doesn't want to eat or drink because of pain in the mouth.
Hand-foot-mouth disease is mostly not serious. The fever and rash clear within a few days. But in some cases, the virus   affects the heart, lungs or brain. This puts the child's life in danger.
A virus causes hand-foot-mouth disease. The disease spreads easily where a lot of young children are together, such as in a child-care center. Sometimes it can also affect teenagers and adults.
In order not to pass on the virus, good hygiene   is important. We should wash our hands as often as possible. Especially we should wash our hands before meals and after going to the toilet. 
 Question:_   can help us to keep away from the hand-foot-mouth disease. 
A. Passing on the virus 
B. Taking children to the child-care center 
C. Keeping your hands clean 
D. Not going to public places 
 Answer: C
Context: It is generally believed that we are getting cleaned when we step under a shower. We are, but we're also giving a home to lots of tiny little creatures we didn't even know about. A showerhead carries thousands of bacteria called Mycobacterium.These can cause problems like coughs and tiredness, and a general feeling of poorliness  . When you turn on the water, the bacteria go from the showerhead onto and into your body.
This is a finding of Norman R. Pace and his team at the University of Colorado, in the US. The scientists investigated bacteria in all kinds of human environment, including showers.Pace's team looked at 45 showerheads in nine American cities. They discovered that 30 percent of them had large amounts of flying Mycobacterium.
But Pace said that they _ few threats to the health.Only those with a weak immune system might need to worry.He told the New York Times that the bacteria are not as unpleasant as might be thought.He said that having a shower is no more dangerous than anything else we do in the morning.
But for those who feel sick about the idea of all those microorganisms  , he had some advice. Let the water run for 30 seconds before getting into the shower. Why? The number of bacteria is smaller than that when the water is just turned on. If that seems like a waste of water, he added that you could also change your showerhead every few months.
However, Pace had good news too. He has also been testing the air in US subways. Apart from iron particles  , which are ground off the track by the wheels of trains, subway air is fresh. The reason is that a train's movement pumps fresh outdoor air into the tunnels.
Pace explained that he wanted to understand the natural microbial environments of public places. This kind of knowledge might help discover the microbes to be used in a bioterrorist   attack. 
 Question:From the finding of Norman R. Pace, after taking a shower, we might cough or feel tired because  _  . 
A. it's easy to get a cold when taking a bath 
B. the showerhead carries many bacteria causing illness 
C. we don't get cleaned while showering 
D. we don't get a weak immune system 
 Answer: B
Context: Health experts have long worried about the increasing rate of obesity in kids. It's an important concern: Being weight or obese during childhood can lead to serious problems normally seen in adults, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Poor diets and a lack of exercise are usually the causes. But would you ever have imagined there might be a connection between the bacteria that lived in your guts  when you were a baby and the chance that you would become overweight?
Scientists in Finland recently found just such a link. In a recent study, they showed that overweight kids had different species of bacteria living in their guts.
You probably think of bacteria only as germs that can make you sick. While it's true that some bacteria can make people ill, your body actually depends on some types of bacteria to help you digest food and extract nutrients from it. These ""good"" bacteria live in your guts, where they process the food you eat.
Human babies get these bacterial helpers from their moms. When a baby is born, some of the bacteria in the mother move into the baby's body. Growing babies get additional ""good"" bacteria from the milk their mothers produce. And it turns out the bacteria might play an important role in regulating weight just six years later.
So how could these bacteria affect weight? The researchers still haven't tested that question, but future tests might lead to an answer. 
 Question:The purpose of writing this passage is to   _  . 
A. introduce the role of bacteria in children's weight 
B. analyze the influence of obesity on kids 
C. give advice on how to lose weight quickly 
D. explain the function of bacteria in foods

Context: Perhaps it is hard to imagine that a bad tooth could be deadly. But doctors in the Washington area say a twelveyearold boy died last month of a tooth infection that spread to his brain. They say it might have been prevented if the boy had received the dental care he needed.
Experts at the National Institutes of Health say good dental care should start at birth. They say breast milk is the best food for the healthy development of teeth. Breast milk can help slow bacterial growth and acid production in the mouth.
When baby's teeth begin to appear,you can clean them with a wet toothbrush. Dentists say it is important to find soft toothbrushes made especially for babies,and use them very gently.
The use of fluoride   to protect teeth is common in many parts of the world. This natural element is often added to drinking water supplies. The fluoride mixes with enamel ,the hard surface on teeth,to help prevent holes,or cavities from forming.
But the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry points out that young children often swallow toothpaste when they brush their teeth. The group notes that swallowing fluoridated toothpaste can cause problems. So young children should be carefully supervised when they brush their teeth. And only a small amount of fluoridated toothpaste,the size of a green pea,should be used.
Parents often wonder what effects sucking a thumb or sucking on a pacifier might have on their baby's teeth. Dental experts generally agree that this is fine early in life.
The American Academy of Family Physicians says most kids stop sucking their thumbs by the age of four. If it continues,the group advises parents to talk to their child's dentist or doctor. It could influence the correct development of permanent teeth. 
 Question:The boy with a bad tooth died because  _  . 
A. his tooth disease was very deadly 
B. the doctor refused to treat him properly 
C. he didn't receive timely treatment 
D. something was wrong with his brain

On each of the teeth there was a label with the name of the general and words: ""Buy these teeth and show them to your friends at home."" The general got angry. He rushed to his office and ordered six officers to go around the city and buy all his teeth.
The officers went out and visited every curiosity shop in the capital. They were away from the office all day. In the evening they returned and put on the table in front of the general the teeth they had bought. They had collected 175 teeth.

Context: A growing number of college students are applying to take entry tests for medical and dental   schools among increasing graduate unemployment in Korea.
""I've decided to apply for the test to enter a medical college to become a doctor, changing from my original plan to prepare for a lawyer qualification exam in order to get a more stable job in the future,"" said a 24-year-old college graduate, Lee, who majored in business administration during his undergraduate schooling.
The new medical and dental school system is getting popularity, attracting an increasing number of students every year since its appearance in 2004, as it is open to all college graduates regardless of their previous majors.
The Education Development introduced the new medical and dental education system, in which college students with bachelor's degrees are allowed to study medicine or dentistry by taking the Medical Education Test (MET) and Dental Education Test (DET).
Ten medical schools and six dental colleges that have used the new system have received 4,377 applications   for the entrance exams.
Applicants are getting younger compared with those in their 20s representing 76.9 percent of the total. The tests might be easier for students with biology and chemistry majors, but graduates from other majors are also applying for the tests.
Under the existing medical and dental education system, students should take a two-year premedical course followed by a four-year medical course.
Students graduating under the new medical or dental education system are given master's degrees, while those graduates who studied under the previous system have bachelor's degrees. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. New Medical and Dental School System Is Carried Out in Korea 
B. Korean College Students Have a New Job Choice 
C. Korean College Students Rush to Medical and Dental Schools

Context: Today, the biggest killers stem as much from our lifestyles as from bacteria and viruses.  One of the worst of these is heart disease, and specifically high blood pressure. It's a slow, but efficient killer that robs many people of what should be the last 10, 20 or 30 years of their lives.
Scientists are claiming that they have now separated unusual ingredients in a rare seaweed discovered by fishermen off the coast of Korea that offer incredible health benefits--including the ability to restore blood pressure to normal levels.
Dr. Haengwoo Lee, a famous biochemist conducted a clinical study on these two ingredients. The first is Seanol, an extremely rare seaweed extract  from Ecklonia Cava that's proven to be 100 times more powerful than any land-based antioxidant . That's because it stays working in your body for 12 hours, compared to land-based antioxidants that work for 30 minutes.  ""Its secret is its make-up of special chemicals that are a huge 40% fat soluble( ),"" Dr. Lee explains. ""Unlike nearly all land-based antioxidants that are water soluble, Seanol's protective compounds can get into things like the fatty tissues of your brain and penetrate  all three layers of your cells, including the outside, the oil-based cell membranes , and your DNA."" Indeed, Seanol is so powerful, it's the only FDA-approved Ecklonia Cava marine-algae    extract in existence.
The second ingredient is Calamarine, a deep-sea omega-3 discovery that delivers 85% more DHA omega-3s to your heart, brain, joints, and eyes. It's known to reduce the problems from tiredness and poor memory, joint pain, mood swings and depression.
With that research in mind, Dr. Lee combined Seanol and Calamarine with a high dose of vitamin D to form  Marine-D3, the newest supplement in the fight against age-related illnesses and high blood pressure.
Dr. Lee found that Calamarine delivers some of the greatest concentration of omega-3s known to science. Combined with Seanol's ability to reduce body inflammation , as well as help cells get the nutrients they need to thrive, stay healthy and protected, Marine-D3 is able to boost a body's entire well being.
The makers of Marine-D3 are so confident that you'll see fast dramatic results from this product, that if you aren't happy after two full months, simply return the unused portion and they'll buy it back. They'll even give you ten dollars extra just for giving it an honest try! That kind of faith, combined with Dr. Lee's exhaustive research, shows that Marine-D3 really is a one-of-a-kind product. 
 Question:What's the makers' attitude toward Marine-D3? 
A. pessimistic 
B. indifferent 
C. doubtful 
D. Optimistic 
 Answer: D

Context: Nowadays, the food we eat seems to have great effects on our health. Although science has made enormous steps in making food more fit to eat, it has, at the same time, made many foods unfit to eat. Some research has shown that perhaps eighty percent of all human illnesses are related to diet and forty percent of cancer is related to the diet as well, especially cancer of the colon. Different cultures are more likely to cause certain different illnesses because of the food that is characteristic in these cultures.
That food is related to illness is not a new discovery. In 1945, about 68 years ago, government researchers realized that nitrates, commonly used to preserve color in meats, and other food additives, caused cancer. Yet, these carcinogenic additives remain in our food, and it becomes more difficult all the time to know which things on the packaging labels of processed food are helpful or harmful. The additives which we eat are not all so direct. Farmers often give penicillin to beef and living animals, and because of this, penicillin has been found in the milk of treated cow. Sometimes similar drugs are given to animals not for medical purposes, but for financial reasons. The farmers are simply trying to fatten the animals in order to obtain a higher price on the market. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has tried repeatedly to control these procedures, the practices continue. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is NOT true? 
A. Drugs are always given to animals for medical reasons 
B. Some of the additives in our food are added to the food itself and some are given to the living animals 
C. Researchers have known about the potential dangers of food additives for over thirty-five years. 
D. Food may cause forty percent of cancer in world.

Context: Which animal has the fastest snapping jaw  ? If you're guessing a shark or perhaps a larger animal, you'll have to think smaller. The trapjaw ant, which lives in Central and South America, moves its mouth parts at 35 to 63 meters per second. Another way to think about this is that the ant's jaws close at 125 to 233 kilometers per hour. That's 2, 300 times faster than the blink of an eye.
Scientists were able to measure the amazing jaw speed using highspeed video techniques. Sheila Patek, a biologist, says the key is that the jaws have a springy   system, which is critical in getting explosive   speeds.
Consider a bow and arrow. If you try to throw an arrow with your arm, it won't go very far. If you use a bow, elastic energy stored in the bow is released almost instantly when you release the arrow with your finger or a latch. The combination of the springy bow and latch mechanism is what makes the arrow zoom through the air.
Maybe even more amazing than how fast these ants grab food or even enemies is how they use this same energy to move. As the ant closes its jaws, it uses them to push off the ground--all faster than the eye can see without slow motion video. A snap of the jaw can send an ant up to 8.3 centimeters into the air. That's like someone who is 1.7 meters jumping 13 meters high! Not only can they quickly escape from enemies, but often a group of ants will start jumping all at once. It would be hard for their enemies to grab just one.
People have suspected the ants used their jaws to jump for over a century, but could only prove it with today's modern video equipment. 
 Question:According to the passage, the trapjaw ants' jaws keep them safe because   _  . 
A. they can catch their enemies easily with their jaws 
B. their jaws make them difficult to recognize 
C. their jaws help them find food easily 
D. their jaws help them escape from their enemies

Context: Ever feel like there aren't enough hours in the day? A group of timechallenged Canadian women are wishing for a 25hour clock.
Jessie Behan, president of the 25th Hour Coalition  which is a group of Canadian women who have changed to a longer day, said the struggle for women to maintain worklife balance motivated   her to research the body's natural clock.""Many of my girlfriends are having kids,getting married, and I see the sufferings of dealing all that when you're a working woman,""she said.""Women like myself are sick of living their lives by a 24hour clock.""
A 2007 study by Charles Czeisler found a switch to longer days could be beneficial, especially for frequent travelers, shift workers, astronauts and those who experience trouble sleeping or waking.
In a similar study, Czeisler showed the body's natural clock averages 24 hours and 11 minutes in both young and older people.The current 360degree clock has 720 minutes, giving each minute 0.5 degree.With the new 25hour day, 30 minutes is added to each 12hour period making each minute 0.48 degree.
While still a relatively small movement-the 25th Hour Coalition has 160 Facebook members, Behan is hoping for large changes.""The goal is to get as many women on board; there's no harm in just trying it out and seeing.If it gets big, maybe the government will decide to standardize it.""
A recent online survey by Reader's Digest, which included 150 people in each of the 13 countries, suggests it's not just Canadians looking for longer days.Readers were asked""what would you do with an extra hour""if given a choice between sleep, work, exercise and family time.In Spain, half of respondents  said they'd like an extra hour in the day to devote to family time.The same was found for respondents in Brazil, the US and Britain, who chose family time over sleep, which came in at a close second.Only in India did work top the list with 50 percent of respondents claiming they could use an extra hour at the office. 
 Question:Why does Jessie Behan want more women to join the 25th Hour Coalition? 
A. Because she intends to make more Facebook friends. 
B. Because she hopes to get benefits from more people. 
C. Because she considers it is harmless to form such an organization. 
D. Because she thinks more women may allow the dream to come true.

Context: One way that scientists   learn about man is by studying animals.In this lab, the scientists are studying the relationship between diet and health.
They are studying the relationship between the amount   of food the mice eat and their health.The mice are in three groups.All three groups are receiving the same healthy food.The first group is eating one cup of food each day, the second group is eating two cups, and the third group is eating three cups.
After three years, the healthiest group is the one that is only eating one cup of food each day.The mice in this group are a little thinner. But _ are more active.Most of the day, they are running, playing with one another.Also, they are living longer.Mice usually live for two years.Most of the mice in this group are still alive after three years.
The second group of mice is healthy, too.They are active, but not as active as the thinner mice.They are only living about two years.
The last group of mice is receiving more food than the other two groups.Most of the day, these mice are eating or sleeping.They are not very active.These mice are living longer than the scientists thought-about a year and a half.But they are not healthy.They are sick more often than the other two groups.

Context: Australian scientists are trying to give kangaroo-style stomachs to cattle and sheep in order to cut the greenhouse gases they send out, which is thought to be responsible for global warming. 
  Thanks to special bacteria in their stomachs, kangaroo flatulence contains nomethane  and scientists want to transfer that bacteria to cattle and sheep who produce large quantities of the harmful gas. 
  While the usual image of greenhouse gas pollution is a billowing smokestack pushing out carbon dioxide, farm animals' passing wind contributes a surprisingly high percentage of total emissions in some countries. 
  ""Fourteen percent of emissions from all sources in Australia is from enteric  methane from cattle and sheep,"" said Athol Klieve, a senior research scientist with the Queensland state government. 
 ""And if you look at another country such as New Zealand, which has got a much higher agricultural base, they're actually up around 50 percent,"" he said. 
  Researchers say the bacteria also make the digestive process much more efficient and could potentially save millions of dollars in feed costs for farmers. 
 But it will take researchers at least three years to isolate the bacteria, before they can even start to develop a way of transferring it to cattle and sheep. 
 Another group of scientists, meanwhile, has suggested Australians should farm fewer cattle and sheep and just eat more kangaroos. And about 20 percent of health-conscious Australians have eaten the national symbol already. 
 ""It's low in fat, it's got high protein levels and it's very clean in the sense that basically it's the free-range animal,"" said Peter Ampt of the University of New South Wales's institute
of environmental studies.

Context: 2009 is the year of what? Yes, it's the year of the Ox. But do you know that 2009 is also the year of the telescope? This year the world celebrates the 400thanniversary of Galileo's observations of the universe through an astronomical telescope  . In 1609, the Italian scientist first pointed a ""Dutch perspective glass"" at the night sky and made discoveries that changed mankind's conceptions of the universe. 
In honor of Galileo's discoveries, the United Nations and the International Astronomical Union have declared 2009 to be the International Year of Astronomy (IYA 2009).
IYA 2009 is a yearlong celebration of astronomy. Its goal is to spread knowledge of astronomy's contributions to society and culture and to inspire more interest in astronomy and science, especially among young people. The theme of the celebration is ""The Universe, Yours to Discover.""
One interesting aim of the IYA is to encourage more diversity   in the field of astronomy and physics. IYA organizers hope that the yearlong celebration of astronomy will inspire more females and underrepresented minorities to pursue   careers in science. An event that will help further that goal is 100 Hours of Astronomy (100 HA) that will fall on April. This event aims to have as many people as possible look through a telescope. From April 2ndto 5th, millions of people worldwide will peer through telescopes to catch their first glimpse   of the universe, just as Galileo's did 400 years ago. Sidewalk astronomy events will give city-dwellers   an excellent opportunity to see the moon, the planet Saturn, and other objects in position for early evening observations. 
Organizers hope that the activities of IYA will ""promote   a greater appreciation of the astronomy."" So join the fun. Look through a telescope this year!

Context: In recent years advances in medical technology have made it possible for people to live longer than in the past. New medicines and instruments are being developed every day to extend life. However,some people,including some doctors, are not in favour of these life extending measures,and they argue that people should have the right to die when they want. They say that the quality of life is as important as life itself,and that people should not be forced to go on living when conditions of life have become unbearable(. They say that people should be allowed to die with dignity  and to decide when they want to die. Others argue that life under any conditions is better. 
 Question:The writer's opinion is  _  . 
A. death is better than life 
B. life is better than death 
C. neither death nor life is good 
D. none of the above

Context: Here is a question I have often asked at dinner parties:
You're on an island with only one other person, your best friend. He's dying of cancer. In his final days, he tells you, ""I have 100,000 dollars in a bank back home. When I die, make sure my son goes to medical school."" Then he dies. But his son is a no-good playboy who has no interest in going to medical school and will waste that money away in a very short time. But your son is entering college, and he is willing to become a doctor. Which one do you give the money to for medical school?
I've asked this question of everyone from the president of a famous university to an ordinary young soldier, and it has never failed to get a discussion going. Everyone has an opinion, most of them different, but all of them correct. Sometimes this one topic lasts the whole evening. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE to the passage? 
A. Only the clever people can answer the question rightly. 
B. Some people refuse to answer such a silly question. 
C. Everyone at the dinner party seems to be interested in the question. 
D. Most of the people have the same answer. 
 Answer: C
Context: The relationship between exercise and cancer has long both intrigued and puzzled oncologists and exercise physiologists.
Exercise is strongly associated with lowered risks for many types of cancer. At the same time, exercise involves biological stress, which typically leads to a short-term increase in inflammation  which can contribute to higher risks for many cancers.
Now, a new study in mice may offer some clues into the exercise-cancer paradox. It suggests that exercise may change how the immune system deals with cancer by boosting adrenaline , certain immune cells and other chemicals that, together, can reduce the severity of cancer or fight it off altogether.
To try to better understand how exercise can both elevate inflammation and simultaneously protect the body against cancer, scientists at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and other institutions decided to closely examine what happens inside mice at high risk for the disease.
So, for the new study, they began by gathering a group of adult lab mice. These animals generally like to run.
The scientists then implanted melanoma   skin cancer cells into the mice before providing half of them with running wheels in their cages while the other animals remained sedentary. After four weeks, far fewer of the runners had developed full-blown melanoma than the sedentary mice and those that had been diagnosed with the disease showed fewer and smaller lesions.
They drew blood from both the exercising and sedentary animals and cells from any tumors in both groups. As expected, they found much higher levels of the hormone adrenaline in the blood of the exercising animals, especially right after they had been working out on the wheels but also at other times of the day. The body releases adrenaline in response to almost any type of stressful experience, including exercise.
They also found higher levels of interleukin-6 in the blood of the runners. This is a substance that is released by working muscles and is believed to both increase and decrease inflammation in the body, depending on where and how it goes to work.
Perhaps most important, they found much higher numbers in the bloodstreams of runners than in the sedentary mice of a type of immune cell named natural killer cells that are known to be strong cancer fighters.
So the scientists repeated their original experiment multiple times, inducing cancer while allowing some mice to run and others to sit. In some of these follow-up experiments, the scientists injected the runners with a substance that blocked the production of adrenaline and gave sedentary animals large doses of added adrenaline.
What they now found was that when running mice could not produce adrenaline, they developed cancer at the same rate as the sedentary animals, while the sedentary animals that had been injected with extra adrenaline fought off their tumors better than other sitting mice.
More remarkably, the scientists determined that adrenaline seemed to be sending biochemical signals to some of the animals' IL-6 cells, making them physiologically more alert, so that when a tumor began to develop in the affected animal, those IL-6 cells in turn activated the natural killer cells in the bloodstream and actually directed them to the tumors, like minute guide fish.
With these results, ""we show that voluntary wheel running in mice can reduce the growth of tumors, and we have identified an exercise-dependent mobilization of natural killer cells as the underlying cause of this protection,"" said Pernille Hojman, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen who oversaw the new study. It perhaps provides one more incentive for us to get up and move. 
 Question:According to the study, we can infer the fundamental substance to fight the cancer off is   _  . 
A. adrenaline 
B. interleukin-6 
C. natural killer cells 
D. genes

Context: Store shelves are filling up with so-called ""green"" products promising to benefit the environment. A recent argument shows that it can be as difficult for buyers to confirm such statement as for producers to defend them.
The argument concerns the GreenPlug Electricity Saver. The GreenPlug is supposed to prevent energy waste by electrical equipment whose constant -speed motors operate at less full load---as is especially true of older refrigerators. Research showed that such motors can be made to do the same work with less heat, noise, and power consumption just by lowering the voltage of the power supply. 
         John and Wyck Hay, started Green Technologies to apply that finding to home appliances. In 
the USA, there are more than 140 million refrigerators in use, accounting for an average of 16% of 
the household electric bill. 
Two years of research resulted in the GreenPlug. Connecting between wall socket and refrigerator, the equipment contains a minicomputer that gives a motor full power (120 volts on average) for start-up, then reduces the power to 106 volts.
Older refrigerators are the most overpowered and, thus, save the most energy with a GreenPlug. Refrigerators less than two years old are already energy-saving that a GreenPlug actually makes them waste electricity.
The higher the voltage, the larger the difference a GreenPlug makes.
Higher power costs shorten the payback time. The population-weighted national average is 10 cents per kilowatt-hour. But some residents in Washington State pay 1.5 cents. Some in Alaska pay 41.6 cents.
Then come highly individual household differences like the number of children or refrigerator
-opening age. All in all, the GreenPlug should save the average consumer $20 a year.
Although the GreenPlug lowered the voltage as it was designed to do,Consumer Reports, an influential magazine, questioned how quickly---if ever---electricity savings due to the plug would repay its cost. People would be better off buying a new, high-efficiency refrigerator, the magazine advised.
Consumer Reports also said that the GreenPlug didn't give a promised 25% savings worth $50 a year. The savings on the oldest model was the best at 8.6%, worth $20 a year. 
Green Technologies ordered tests of the GreenPlug on up to 2,800 refrigerators through next year. The company will not put that data in stores. Instead, potential buyers will call to learn how their model of refrigerator performed. 
         Meanwhile, there is little evidence of consumer dissatisfaction. Sales topped 45,000 units last 
month. The return rate is less than 0.2%. 
 Question:The GreenPlug on store shelves are due mostly to   _  . 
A. an increased concern about the environment 
B. a demand for money-saving technology 
C. the high cost of electrical power 
D. the shortage of power supply

Context: A machine which makes water out of air could become the greatest household invention since the microwave. Using the same technology as a dehumidifier  , the Water Mill is able to create a ready supply of drinking water by getting it from a limitless source-the air. The company behind the machine says not only does it offer all alterative to bottled water in developed countries,but it is a solution for the millions who face a daily water shortage.
The machine works by drawing in damp air through a filter  and over a cooling element which changes it into water droplets.It can produce up to 12 liters a day.The Water Mill will also produce more water when storms pass over, as the humidity in the air increases.In keeping with its ecodevelopment,the machine uses the same amount of electricity as three light bulbs.
Inventor Jonathan Ritchey said:""The demand for water is
.People are looking for freedom from water distribution systems that are shaky and unreliable"".
The machine,which is about 3 feet wide,is likely to costPS800 when it goes on sale here in the spring.Its maker, Canadian firm Element Four, estimates that a liter of water will cost around 20 pence to produce.
Environmentalists claim half the world's population will face water shortage because of climate change by 2080.One in five humans is said to lack access to safe drinking water.
The Water Mill is not effective in areas with below about 30 percent relative humidity, but with average relative humidity in England of more than 70 percent that won't be much of an issue here. 
 Question:According to the author, the biggest advantage of the machine is its    _   . 
A. little power use 
B. unlimited source 
C. proper size 
D. high production

Context: Right in the middle of the town are some long ponds . They are only about half a foot deep. The men of Symi dug out the earth to make the ponds.
Over each pond is a low cover. It is made of glass that you can see through.
At night, sea water is taken into the ponds. The next day, the hot sun shines through the covers. The sun light turns the water into vapor  and the vapor goes up from the ponds. The salt is left behind.
As it goes, the vapor became mist. On the inside of each cover, the little drops of mist run together to make big drops. These drops run down the sides of the cover, filling other ponds with fresh water.
The salt left in the ponds is washed out each night. Then more sea water is taken in. The factory is ready for the next day's work. The covers and other parts of the factory cost very little. Sea water and sun cost nothing. Most people of Symi are poor. So to them this new way of getting fresh water seems wonderful.

Context: Tuvalu, a tiny country in the Pacific Ocean, has asked for help as it fears it will be swallowed up by the sea.
Storms and huge waves are a constant threat and none of Tuvalu's nine little islands is more than five metres above sea level. Salt water is already entering the country's drinking water supply, as well as damaging plants that produce fruit and vegetable. Without urgent help, the country's days are numbered.
But Tuvalu is not the first place to face sinking into the sea. Venice, a historic city in Italy best known for its canals, has sunk about 24 cm over the past 100 years. Experts say that it will have sunk another 24 cm by 2050. A century ago, St. Mark's Square, the lowest point in the city, flooded about nine times a year. Nowadays, it happens more than 100 times. While Venice is slowly sinking into the mud on which it stands, Tuvalu's rising sea level is caused by global warming.
The average global temperature has increased by almost 0. 5 centigrade degrees over the past century, scientists expect it to rise by extra 1.3 degrees over the next 100 years.
Warmer weather makes glaciers  melt, adding more water to the ocean. The warmer temperatures also make water expand, so it takes up more space, causing the sea level to rise. The sea level has risen 10.25 cm in the last 100 years.
The main cause of global warming is human pollution. Through burning coal, oil and gas, people have been increasing the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as CO2. This adds to the power of the greenhouse effect, making the planet even warmer.
Many scientists believe that, if the warming is not stopped, there will be huge climate changes. The sea level could rise by one meter this century.
Should this come true, the sea will swallow up millions of homes and the world will be flooded with "" _ "" looking for somewhere to live.

Context: The journey two naval officers made some time ago to the very deepest point on the earth makes us realize how much of the world still remains to be explored.The two men went down 7 miles to the bottoms of the Pacific Ocean inside a small steel ball called a ""bathyscaphe"" to find out if there are any ocean currents or signs of life.Above the ball there was a special tank full of petrol which was slowly emptied into the water to make the bathyscaphe heavy enough to complete its journey.
It was necessary to set out early, so that the bathyscaphe would come to the surface in daylight, and so be easily found by the mother ship which would be waiting for it.The divers began preparations at dawn and soon afterwards, when all was ready, the steel ball disappeared under the surface of the water.
The divers felt as if they were going down steps as they passed through warm and cold layers of water.In time, the temperature dropped to freezing point and the men shivered inside the ball.They kept in touch with the mother ship by telephone describing how they felt.Then , at a depth of 3,000 feet, the telephone stopped working and they were quite cut off from the outside world.All went well until some four hours later at 30,000 feet, the men were startled by a loud, cracking noise; even the smallest hole in the ball would have meant instant death.Luckily, though, it was only one of the outer windows that badly broken.Soon afterwards, the bathyscaphe touched the soft ocean floor raising a big cloud of ""dust"" made up of small, dead sea-creatures.Here, powerful lights lit up the dark water and the men were surprised to see fish swimming just above them quite untroubled by the enormous pressure.But they didn't dare to leave the lights on for long, as the heat from the lights made the water boil.Quite unexpectedly, the telephone began working again and the faint but clear voices of the officers were heard on the mother ship 7 miles away.After a stay of thirty minutes the men began their journey up, arriving three hours later, cold and wet through, but none the worse for their experience. 
 Question:After they got to the bottom of the ocean ,   _  . 
A. they could get in touch with the mother ship seven miles away 
B. they were cut off from the outside world

Context: People who are worried about bad breath often reach for a toothbrush or a gun. But in the future, personal breath monitoring may include far more than fresh breath.
In face, breath is so rich in chemical compounds that fully understanding it has proved challenging. Each breath contains gases like carbon dioxide, the volatile remains of recent snacks, medicines and even compounds taken in from things like carpeting or various kinds of air pollution. But breath detectors  can sort out these substances with increasing sensitivity . 
Scientists are building electronic sniffers that examine the exhaled air for signs of cancer, asthma , and other diseases.
""There are clear signatures in the breath for liver disease, kidney disease and heart disease. Breath is a rich mixture that can reflect out state of health and disease."" said Dr. Raed Dweik, director of the Cleveland Clinic, adding ""Breath analysis is the future of medical testing.""
He and his partners are testing a desktop system called BreathLink for use in rapid identification of diseases. The system is designed to work wherever there is an Internet connection. To use BreathLink, a person breathes into a long tube, and a breath sample is collected and analyzed within the system. Then it can detail chemical concentrations of the breath in graphics. Dr. Raed Dweik said, ""If you examine patients of asthma, you will find they have higher levels of nitric oxide  in their exhaled air. It reflects their abnormal symptoms in the lungs."" His tests have reached 85 percent accuracy so far in spotting people with some illness.
But some trained dogs, he pointed out, can sniff out cancer with 99 percent accuracy--although without the ability to identify particular compounds the way some detectors can.
""We are getting better and better,"" he said. ""But whether we will ever approach the accuracy of the dog--we don't know."" 
 Question:It can be inferred that  _ 
A. brushing teeth can improve one's bad breath 
B. there are leftovers like snacks and medicines in one's breath 
C. one can know exactly about his physical state through the breath 
D. breath analysis can be helpful in medical diagnosis 
 Answer: D
Context: Can you smell two things at once? This experiment comes from the research of two scientists from Rice University. Denise Chen and Wen Zhou have been experimenting with the science of smell, and have made some very interesting discoveries. 
              To explore that, you will need two things with strong, characteristic smells and, of course, your nose. The idea is to smell a different smell with each nostril  . Hold one smell very close to your right nostril, and the other smell very close to your left nostril. Then breathe in and pay close attention to what you smell.
              What you should find is that one smell will be very strong. After another sniff   or two, the first smell will go away, and you will smell the other smell. Keep sniffing, and the first smell will come back. Instead of smelling the two smells evenly   mixed, they will work in turns, one after the other.
              Why? Chen and Zhou found that your sense of smell acts much like your sense of sight. Hold a book in front of your nose, so that your left eye sees things on the left side of the book, and your right eye sees things on the right side of the book. You will find that your sight works in turns, first on the left side of the book and then on the right side. Notice that you can't focus your left eye on one object while focusing your right eye on another object. Your brain jumps back and forth  , paying attention to one and then the other. The same thing happens with your nostrils. If they are smelling different smells, your brain pays attention to one and then the other.

Context: Nola is a 41-year-old northern white rhino  that lives at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park in Escondido, California. She is one of only four remaining northern white rhinos in the world, and the only one in the western part of the earth. The other three live in Kenya .
Rhinos have lived on earth for more than 40 million years, but they are now at the risk of dying out. Hunters illegally hunt rhinos for their horns , which are used for art, jewelry, and decorations. They sell the horns for thousands of dollars per pound, though it is not allowed by law. Rhino horns are also prized as a key part in traditional medicine, even though scientific tests have proven that the horns cannot cure illnesses. Experts say that every eight hours, one rhino will be hunted.
Scientists are trying to find ways to prevent rhinos from dying out. In 1975, the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research started the Frozen Zoo, a program through which researchers have collected cell samples  from more than 8,000 different animal species until now, including the northern white rhino. Scientists hope that by studying the rhino cells, they will gain greater understanding of the species, and will find ways to increase its number.
Jeanne Loring works with the Frozen Zoo. Loring's research focuses on pluripotent stem cells, which are cells that can renew and become any cell type. Loring's lab at TSRI is working together with scientist Oliver Ryder of the San Diego Zoo to use pluripotent stem cells to try to increase the number of the northern white rhino.

Context: Jack Andraka from Maryland won the grand prize at the 2012 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. It is the largest high school science competition in the world. The Maryland teenager is the youngest winner of the $75,000 prize. He was chosen from among 1,500 students in 70 countries.
Jack Andraka invented a test for pancreatic cancer  . He started to learn it after losing a close family friend to the disease. ""I went on the Internet and I found that 85%of all pancreatic cancers are found late, when someone has less than 2% chance of survival , "" he says, ""and I was thinking,' That's not right. We should be able to do something.'"" He found that early discovery is important to increasing the chances of surviving the disease.
The Maryland teenager asked to work in a laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and was allowed. There he developed a simple paper test, which can recognize the disease in a single drop of blood. His test has proved correct 90% of the time. It also is 100 times more sensitive than other tests. ""It costs 3 cents per test, and then it takes only 5 minutes to run,"" he said.
Jack's success wouldn't have been possible without Anirban Maitra, a professor at Johns Hopkins. He was the only person among the 200 researchers Jack wrote to who showed interest in his project. ""I was very surprised that this was a 15-year-old who was writing this. I wanted to meet this clever young man and see what he wanted to talk about and so I called him over for an interview . ""
Jack worked in Professor Maitra's laboratory, completing his project in 7 months. The government has given the Maryland teenager patent rights to the pancreatic cancer test. He is now talking with companies about developing the test into a simple product.
Whatever happens, the professor believes Jack Andraka's name is one we will be hearing again over the next 10 to 20 years.

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. ""

Context: People should go outside and absorb some sunshine to help increase their vitamin D levels, some experts say. Arthritis Research UK. which is a British medical research organization dedicated to curing arthritis  , says vitamin D deficiency can cause bone loss, muscle function problems and, in some cases, rickets   in children.
The government recommends vitamin D supplements   for pregnant women and children aged under five. But on sunny days, a few minutes outdoors should achieve the same results, Arthritis Research UK says.
Figures show that up to a quarter of the population has low levels of vitamin D in their blood and the majority of pregnant women do not take vitamin D supplements. People aged over 65, pregnant and breast-feeding women and children aged six months to five years old are thought to be most at risk.
Vitamin D is essential to help the body absorb calcium   from food. Low levels of vitamin D can result in serious problems.
Alan Silman, the medical director of Arthritis Research UK, said, ""When the days are sunny, go out for a few minutes and expose your face and arms to the sunshine."" But he also had a warning on overexposure. ""Don't allow your skin to go red, and take care not to burn, particularly in strong sunshine and if you have fair or sensitive skin. From June to August, just 15 minutes is generally enough time.""
""In less sunny months,"" Alan Silman added, ""we recommend that people add more vitamin D in their diet by eating more oily fish such as salmon, tuna, and foods rich in vitamin D, such as cereals  ."" 
 Question:Lack of vitamin D may cause the following problems EXCEPT   _  . 
A. bone loss

Context: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog.
Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation.
""The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,"" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery.
The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are ""extremely difficult, if not impossible"" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said.
The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face.
The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants,
Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue.
Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality
There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers.
Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant. 
 Question:The best title for the passage would be   _  . 
A. French Woman has First Partial Face Transplant 
B. First Face Transplant Opens Debate 
C. Risks and Ethical Problems of a Face Transplant 
D. A Complete Face Transplant of a French Woman

Context: For centuries, medical pioneers have refined a variety of methods and medicines to treat sickness, injury, and disability, enabling people to live longer and healthier lives.
""A salamander (a small lizard-like animal) can grow back its leg. Why can't a human do the same?"" asked Peruvian-born surgeon Dr. Anthony Atala in a recent interview. The question, a reference to work aiming to grow new limbs for wounded soldiers, captures the inventive spirit of regenerative medicine. This innovative field seeks to provide patients with replacement body parts.
These parts are not made of steel; they are the real things --- living cells, tissue, and even organs.
Regenerative medicine is still mostly experimental, with clinical applications limited to procedures such as growing sheets of skin on burns and wounds. One of its most significant advances took place in 1999,when a research group at North Carolina's Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine conducted a successful organ replacement with a laboratory-grown bladder. Since then, the team, led by Dr. Atala, has continued to generate a variety of other tissues and organs  from kidneys to ears.
The field of regenerative medicine builds on work conducted in the early twentieth century with the first successful transplants of donated human soft tissue and bone. However, donor organs are not always the best option. First of all, they are in short supply, and many people die while waiting for an available organ; in the United States alone, more than 100,000 people are waiting for organ transplants. Secondly, a patient's body may ultimately reject the transplanted donor organ. An advantage of regenerative medicine is that the tissues are grown from a patient's own cells and will not be rejected by the body's immune system.
Today, several labs are working to create bioartificial body parts. Scientists at Columbia and Yale Universities have grown a jawbone and a lung. At the University of Minnesota, Doris Taylor has created a beating bioartificial rat heart. Dr. Atala's medical team has reported long-term success with bioengineered bladders implanted into young patients with spina bifida (a birth defect that involves the incomplete development of the spinal cord). And at the University of Michigan, H. David Humes has created an artificial kidney.
So far, the kidney procedure has only been used successfully with sheep, but there is hope that one day similar kidney will be implantable in a human patient. The continuing research of scientists such as these may eventually make donor organs unnecessary and, as a result, significantly increase individuals' chances of survival. 
 Question:Why is generative medicine considered innovative? 
A. It will provide patients with replacement soft tissues. 
B. It will strengthen the human body's immune system. 
C. It will shorten the time patients waiting for a donated organ. 
D. It will make patients live longer with bioartificial organs.

Context: Full face transplants are no longer science fiction fantasy, a leading surgeon has said, adding that they are technically feasible but ethically complex.
       Peter Butler from London's Royal Free Hospital called for a debate on the ethics of such an operation made possible by new drugs whichstop the body's immune system rejecting a transplanted face. ""It is not 'Can we do it?' but 'Should we do it?'"" he told the BBC.""The technical part is not complex, but I don't think that's going to be the very great difficulty. The ethical and moral debate is obviously going to have to take place before the first facial transplantation.""

But surgeons could have trouble finding enough willing donors. prefix = st1 /Butlersaid his survey of doctors, nurses and members of the public showed most would accept a face transplant but few were willing to donate their own after dying.

She rejected the idea that the procedure would mean people would end up living with a dead person's face. ""There are so many people without faces, I have half a face... but we are all so much more than just a face... you don't take on their personality. You are still you,"" she told reporters.

Context: Researchers have announced the result of two studies on the health effects of the drug aspirin.One study shows aspirin can sharply reduce the chance that a healthy, older man will suffer from a heart attack.
The study offered two new results from earlier findings, It said taking one aspirin pili every other day helped only healthy men over the age of fifty.It also said aspirin gave the greatest protection against heart attacks to men with low blood cholesterol levels.
Earlier in the United States began a major aspirin study in the early 1980s.It included 22,000 healthy men doctors.Ail were between the ages of forty and eighty-four.More than 11,000 of the doctors took a harmless pill that contained no drug.The men did not know which kind of pill they were taking.
The doctors who took aspirin suffered 44% fewer heart attacks than those taking the harmless pill.139 men who took aspirin suffered from heart attacks.Ten of them died.239 men who did not take aspirin suffered from heart attacks.Twenty-six of them died.
The researchers said the doctors' study provides clear proof that taking aspirin can prevent a first heart attack in healthy, older men.They said, however, the result does not mean every man over the mage of fifty should take aspirin.They said aspirin couldn't help men who do not eat healthy foods, who smoke cigarettes and who are fat.The researchers said men who think they wou3d be helped by taking aspirin should talk with their doctors first. 
 Question:We may learn that the new use of aspirin is   _  . 
A. to treat heart disease 
B. to reduce the chance of a heart attack in old men 
C. to protect old men 
D. to reduce the blood cholesterol levels 
 Answer: B
Context: I was in my first year of college, making friends and enjoying life, but then my whole world turned upside down. I had a heart attack. It felt like someone was stabbing   me in the chest with a knife over and over again.
After three months of rest I went back to college, but then things took a turn for the worse. I was staying at my Nana's house and woke up in the middle of the night with a terrible pain in my chest. I knew I was having a heart attack again.
I couldn't even shout for help. Luckily my grandpa was going to the toilet and heard me falling out of bed. If it wasn't for him, I probably wouldn't be here.
The two holes in my heart were causing the problems and I needed an operation immediately to repair them. Unfortunately, the surgery didn't go well and they only managed to repair one of the holes.
When I woke up from the operation, I had a really dry mouth and couldn't wait to have something to eat and drink. The biggest shock of all came when I was told that I needed a heart transplant and was put on the register. The doctors were stunned at how quickly heart failure came on - it usually takes years, but it took my heart less than six months to get to that stage. My whole world came crashing down, but I stayed strong. It was a choice between crying every day and getting on with my life.
As time went on, life became even harder. I hated feeling weak all the time and needing help with everything. It got to the point where I thought I would never get a new heart. I was diagnosed with depression.
Even though I thought that Christmas 2008 would be my last, I really enjoyed it and even had a good New Year. Everyone was crying for me when the clock struck midnight and they told me to keep fighting.
A week later, I got a call from the doctors saying they'd found a suitable donor  . My wish came true and thankfully the operation went well. I spent four hours in surgery where they took out my old heart and put a new one in. When I woke up I burst out crying. I had a second chance at life. 
 Question:When the author learned that he needed a heart transplant, he   _  . 
A. couldn't help crying every day 
B. chose to continue to fight for his life 
C. felt so depressed that he tried to kill himself 
D. was so anxious that his heart failure developed very quickly 
 Answer: B
Context: Getting enough sleep on a regular basis is one important way to protect the health of your heart. Poor sleep is associated with a range of cardiovascular  problems, including high blood pressure, heart attack, and heart failure. Both men and women are at increased risk for these conditions. But we continue to learn that when it comes to health problems associated with sleep, the particular risks to men and women are not always the same. A new study suggests that for women who already have heart disease, poor sleep may be particularly dangerous to their heart health.
Research indicates that poor-quality sleep--and waking too early in particular--is associated with increased inflammation  among women with heart disease. There was no similar association found for men, suggesting that women with heart disease and sleep problems may be at particular risk for inflammation that can be damaging to the heart.
Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco investigated the relationship between sleep quality and inflammation linked to coronary  heart disease. They also sought information about how an association between sleep and inflammation might differ between men and women. Their investigation included 980 men and women at first, and 626 completed the 5-year study. All of those included were suffering for coronary heart disease. The average age of men in the study was 66. Women were slightly younger, with an average age of 64. Researchers measured sleep quality by asking participants to rate their sleep over the previous month. They also asked for reports of some of the most common sleep problems, including difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking frequently throughout the night, and waking too early in the morning.
After 5 years, researchers repeated tests for inflammation and once again sought reports on sleep quality and sleep problems. When they analyzed data for both men and women together, researchers found no links between inflammations and sleep quality. However, when they analyzed data taking gender  into account, researchers found a relationship between inflammation and sleep existed for women, but not for men. 
 Question:When a person suffers from sleep disorder   _  . 
A. he/she is sure to have cardiovascular problems 
B. he/she may be in a state of poor health 
C. he/she must be in danger of heart disease 
D. he/she might get on poorly with others 
 Answer: B
Context: Smaller than your fist, your healthy heart just goes on and on. It will beat more than 60 times a minute for 70 years or more. That's something that most of us take for granted. But it's an amazing fact.
60 times a minute for 60 minutes is 3,600 times. What physical thing can most of us do 3,600 times in one hour? Blink? Maybe. Tap our fingers on the desk? No. Jump up and down? Certainly not! But our heart keeps beating, hour after hour. Every day, it pumps almost 2,000 gallons of blood through our blood vessels . It takes you about five years to drink 2,000 gallons of water.
And, unlike your knees or your back, your heart does all this work without ever complaining ! You never know that it's even there. Your heart is such a reliable ""silent partner"" that people forget to care for it. For many, the first indication that their heart isn't working properly is a serious heart illness! Over 650,000 Americans die of some kind of heart disease every year. Cancer kills 560,000, stroke kills 143,000, and accidents kill 118,000 Americans annually.
Like accidental deaths, many heart disease-related deaths can be avoided if people simply follow the advice of the experts. Unfortunately, most people seem to listen to a little voice in their head that says, ""It won't happen to me. "" So these people keep on smoking and drinking. They continue to eat too much meat. And their only ""exercise"" is getting off the sofa to get something out of the fridge. Please follow the following steps to keep your heart healthy.

Context: Chinese officials yesterday urged employers to take more measures to protect workers against workplace diseases and injuries.
Experts estimate  that about 200 million workers face a potential danger of occupational diseases and work-related injuries.
The majority of them are farmers-turned-workers who are working in small or medium-sized firms.
One of the most serious workplace diseases on the Chinese mainland is pneumoconiosis, a lung disease that is caused by breathing in too much dust of coal, silicon, and cerement. It causes serious breathing difficulties and can be fatal .
The disease killed 966 people in the country last year, according to an official report released by the Ministry of Health yesterday.
From the early 1950s until the end of last year, 607,570 people were diagnosed with pneumoconiosis.
Among the number, 137,481 people died from the disease.
Chen Xiaohong, vice minister of health, said the general level of prevention and control of workplace diseases is still quite low in China.
""Health authorities  at various levels will do more education work in the future to raise employers` awareness that they are the first person responsible for any workplace diseases or accidents,"" Chen said.
He made the remark at a ceremony held by his ministry and other relevant departments under the State Council to award prizes to 56 companies which have done well in protecting workers` health.
On the Chinese mainland, more than 16 million companies are engaged in potentially dangerous sectors, such as coal mining, construction, and those that use chemicals, according to the Ministry of Health.
Although many companies, especially large foreign-invested and State-owned ones, have done well in protecting workers` health, many employees are still working in dangerous places with poor protection and without any insurance support.
At least 90 per cent of Chinese companies are small or medium-sized organizations.
Many of these companies, especially private ones based in towns and villages, do not want to spend their money strengthening workplace protection against various diseases and injuries, or buying insurance  policies for their employees.
According to statistics  from Chinese labour and social welfare authorities, there are about 120 million farmers-turned-workers working in Chinese cities. Less than 10 per cent of them have medical or injury insurance and many have no contracts  with employers.
According to Chinese law on preventing occupational diseases, employers should establish qualified working conditions before opening factories, buy insurance policies for their workers, and provide regular health examinations for labourers.
However, according to a survey last year of 74,946 companies that use chemicals or are based in ""dangerous sectors,"" only about 50 per cent offered health tests for workers. 
 Question:From the passage, we can infer  _  . 
A. Chinese law on preventing occupational diseases has worked well. 
B. the workers` awareness of protecting themselves has been greatly raised. 
C. much remains to be done to protect the workers from workplace diseases. 
D. the workers themselves are responsible for any workplace diseases or accidents. 
 Answer: C
Context: The current Ebola   outbreak in western and central Africa has infected at least 3,069 people, including 1,552 dead, making it the largest outbreak in history. Ebola is a deadly virus --about 60 percent of people infected with it have died.
How is Ebola doing its harm?
When a person becomes infected with Ebola, the virus damages the body's immune   cells, which defend against infection, said a researcher at Lancaster University. But if a person's immune system can stand up to this attack, then he is more likely to survive the disease.
The patients that survive it best are those who don't get such a bad disadvantage in immune system. But if the body isn't able to get rid of this attack, then the immune system becomes less able to regulate   itself. This means the immune system is more likely to run out of control, leading to a drop in blood pressure, multi-organ failure and eventually death.
What are the common symptoms of the disease?
Fever. Headache. Joint and muscle aches. Weakness. Diarrhea. Vomiting. Stomach pain. Lack of appetite. Chills. Rash. Redness in the eyes. Hiccups. Cough. Sore throat. Chest pain. Difficult breathing or swallowing. Bleeding inside and outside of the body.
How to prevent the spread of Ebola?
Ebola can be spread primarily via direct contact with patients, specifically the blood and fluids of an infected patient.
We should avoid contact with infected patients and objects such as clothing, bedding, and needles used by them. Avoid areas where infections have been reported. For now, the disease has only been confirmed in central and West Africa, four cases in America and Europe. Avoid eating wild-caught bush meat. Researchers have suspected that the disease came to humans via animals, probably through the meat of primates . If you're in an area where the disease has been reported, avoid purchasing, eating, or handling wild game to stay on the safe side.
Wear protective medical clothing if you're around infected patients. Extreme caution is necessary. Hospital workers must use masks, gloves, goggles, and gowns, which needed to be worn at all times if you're around infected patients.
How Do People Survive Ebola?
Doctors don't know for certain who will survive Ebola, and there is no specific treatment or cure for the disease. Although in the minority, some people do recover from infection.
Our suggestions include:
Maintain your electrolytes   and body liquid. Sports drinks can be used. Monitor your blood pressure and control it if necessary. Dropping blood pressure may be a serious sign of infection. Breathe in an oxygen-rich environment. Quickly address any symptoms of infection. Be honest about when and where you're feeling pain. 
 Question:Ebola causes the death of a human being by   _  . 
A. attacking him with high fever 
B. regulating his immune system 
C. damaging his immune cells 
D. harming all his organs directly 
 Answer: C
Context: There are various reasons why cancers appear to be on the increase. For one thing, though their sufferers are to be found in all age groups, cancers are particularly likely to attack persons in their middle and advanced years. Naturally, since people live longer these years, there are more cancer sufferers than before. Again, with better methods of diagnosis  , doctors can more easily recognize cancerous growths that would formerly have passed unnoticed or that would have been wrongly diagnosed. It is also believed that certain habits and conditions of modern living, including heavy smoking and the pollution of the air, may leave people living in more cancer-causing conditions than before.
We all look forward to the day when a simple medical test can find cancer while it is still small. Researchers around the world are working on _ . Most of their work deals with the examination of the blood.
Researchers in Boston have found something in the blood of cancer patients that does not appear in healthy persons. The test showed which persons had cancer and which did not. It was correct more than 90 percent of the time.
The researchers believe the test may be able to show cancer very clearly in its development. Cancers discovered early usually can be treated successfully.
The test examines very small bits of fat in the blood called lipids  . Cancers seem to change lipids although doctors do not know why. The test showed differences between the lipids of the persons with cancer and the lipids of those without cancer.
The researchers say the new test could be a step to develop a simple way to check patients for cancer before the disease shows on an X-ray. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. A simple way to cancer 
B. Cancers can be cured 
C. How to find cancer 
D. Early discovery of cancer 
 Answer: D
Context: Such chronic   diseases as heart disease, stroke, cancer and lung disorders are the most leading causes of death in the world. Yet health experts say these conditions are often the most preventable.
The World Health Organization (WHO) points out chronic diseases lead to about 17 million early deaths each year. The United Nations (UN) agency expects more than 380 million people to die of chronic diseases by 2015. About 80% of the deaths will happen in developing nations.
Chronic diseases now cause two-thirds of all deaths in the Asia-Pacific area. In ten years it could be almost three-fourths. People are getting sick in their most economically productive years. In fact, chronic diseases are killing more middle-aged people in poorer countries than in richer ones. The WHO estimates   that chronic diseases will cost China alone more than 500,000 million dollars in the next ten years. That estimate represents the costs of medical treatment and lost productivity. Russia and India are also expected to face huge economic losses.
According to a WHO report, deaths from chronic diseases have increased largely as the result of economic gains in many countries. Until recently infectious and parasitic   diseases have been the main killers in Asia and the Pacific but they are no longer the major cause of death in most countries.
As many as 80% of the deaths from chronic diseases could be prevented, health officials say. An important tool for governments is to limit the marketing of alcohol and tobacco to young people. Also, more programs are needed to urge healthy eating and more physical activity.
The UN aims to reduce chronic-disease deaths by 2% each year by international action through 2015, that's to say, 36 million lives could be saved, including 25 million in Asia and the Pacific. 
 Question:In many countries, what's mainly responsible for increasing deaths from chronic diseases? 
A. The economic development. 
B. The poor living conditions. 
C. Infectious and parasitic diseases. 
D. Young people's bad habits.

Context: The World Health Organization (WHO) planned to study the relationship between the eating habits of the people and the disease. Two doctors were chosen to make the study. They flew to Africa south of the Sahara and during the next two months visited ten countries. They found that serious diseases of poor eating, often mistaken for other diseases, existed in all parts of Africa. The diseases were similar and could therefore all be named kwashiorkor. The diseased children are usually from one to four years old. As the illness progresses, the child's stomach becomes swollen by liquid collecting in the body. The skin changes color and may break out in open sores . The hair changes color and starts to fall out. The patient loses all interest in his surroundings and even in food, and becomes so weak that he wants to lie down all the time. Stomach liquids are no longer produced.
The doctors reasoned that kwashiorkor was found in the young children of this age in many parts of Africa because of lack of milk or meat. Their mothers, after stopping their breastfeeding, gave them foods full of starches instead of greatly needed proteins. They found that the addition of milk to the food of the children suffering from kwashiorkor saved many lives.
The unbelievable thing about kwashiorkor is that the very existence of the disease--which has been killing thousands of children for centuries--was not even recognized in Latin America as recently as ten years ago. The deaths of those children were mistakenly listed as due to other diseases. It was the WHO's work in Africa that led to the discovery of the problem in Central America. 
 Question:It is difficult to discover kwashiorkor because   _   . 
A. it has no symptoms at all 
B. it is hard to identify signs of it 
C. it doesn't last long enough for careful observation 
D. it is hardly different from other diseases

 Answer: B
Context: Just one bite of cake that is made with eggs is enough to make John feel very sick. Susan gets a terrible rash whenever she eats anything containing seafood, and David nearly died when he first ate a cookie that included peanuts. David had trouble breathing after he ate the cookie, but his mother knew what to do and she quickly gave him medicine that helped him feel better almost right away. The body's reaction to certain foods can be quite severe, resulting in breathing problems, as in David's case, or loss of consciousness for some. There are many things we eat may cause our bodies to react badly if we have a food allergy . The most common food allergies seem to be related to milk, soy, eggs, wheat flour, peanuts, nuts, and seafood. In fact, these kinds of foods account for 90% of food allergies.
According to some studies, the number of children who have a food allergy is growing. But some people now argue that test results might not actually be accurate, so food allergies are not really as common as they may appear.
There are three typical ways that doctors test for food allergies. Probably the most accurate way is for a doctor to give a child a  food challenge"", For this, the doctor watches the child eat small amounts of certain foods to see if the child has an allergic reaction or not. This method is very time consuming so it is used less often than the other two methods: skin tests and blood tests. In a skin test, a doctor puts very small amounts of the parts of the foods that the child may be allergic to under the child's skin, then watches to see if the child's skin reacts to the allergens . In a blood test, doctors take some of the child's blood and add possible allergens to it and then look for chemicals in the blood that indicate a possible allergic reaction.
A problem with both the skin test and the blood test is that neither will show how severe an allergic reaction might be. If a test result is positive, the child may have a severe reaction by eating this food, but the child might just as likely only have a slight rash. The test will not show which of these might be the case.
Dr. Jennifer Chafen of Stanford University studied 10 years' worth of allergy research to check how accurate the tests are. She found a surprising fact. Skin tests or blood tests given to patients who visited their doctors for treatment of rashes or stomachaches showed that these patients were allergic to certain foods. However, later tests showed that although these patients tested positive, fewer than 50 percent of them actually had blood allergies. So were the results false and can we rely on these test results? 
The problem might be food intolerance rather than a food allergy. While foodallergies are mainly related to a person's immune system, food intolerance is related to a person's digestive system and the reaction is usually less severe. One of the most common kinds of food intolerance is related to people who have trouble digesting the sugar in products like milk, cheese, and ice cream.
Doctors are not sure why the number of cases of food allergies is rising. One factor that may explain part of the problem is our cleaner environment. Most children are exposed to fewer germs these days and some researchers think that for some people, their body's immune system makes work for itself by reacting as if certain foods are harmful.
While allergy test results may show false positive results, the tests are still useful and can save lives. Some children lose their food allergies as they get older, so even though doctors do not have a cure for food allergies, sometimes the body finds its own cure. 
 Question:We can be inferred from the passage that  _  . 
A. Doctors know clearly why the number of food allergies is increasing. 
B. Allergies affect the digestive system more than the immune system 
C. Allergy test in fact makes little sense 
D. The more children expose themselves to germs, the better their immune system works.

Context: Scientists from the University of East Anglia have identified four new man-made gases that are contributing to the damage to the ozone  layer. Two of the gases are accumulating at a rate that is causing concern among researchers.
     Worries over the growing ozone hole have seen the production of chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gases restricted since the mid 1980s. But the precise origin of these new, similar substances remains a mystery.
     Lying in the atmosphere, the ozone layer plays a critical role in blocking harmful UV rays, which cause cancers in humans and reproductive problems in animals.
      Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey were the first to discover a huge ""hole"" in the ozone over Antarctica in 1985. The evidence quickly pointed to CFC gases, which were invented in the 1920s, and were widely used in refrigeration. Extraordinarily, global action was rapidly agreed to deal with CFCs and the Montreal Protocol to limit these substances came into being in 1987. A total global ban on production came into force in 2010.
     Now, the newly discovered four new gases can destroy ozone and are getting into the atmosphere from as yet unidentified sources. Three of the gases are CFCs and one is a hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC), which can also damage ozone.
     The research has shown that four gases were not around in the atmosphere at all until the 1960s, which suggests they are man-made. The scientists discovered the gases by analyzing polar snow pack. Air from this snow is a natural archive of what was in the atmosphere up t0 100 years ago. The researchers also looked at modern air samples, collected at remote Cape Grim in Tasmania.
     They estimate that about 74,000 tonnes of these gases have been released into the atmosphere. Two of the gases are accumulating at significant rates. However, they don't know where the new gases are being released from and this should be investigated. Possible sources include chemicals  for insecticide  production and solvents   for cleaning electronic components. The three CFCs are being destroyed very slowly in the atmosphere - so even if emissions  were to stop immediately, they will still be around for many decades to come.
     Of the four species identified, CFC-113a seems the most worrying as there is a very small but growing emission source somewhere, maybe from agricultural insecticides. We should find it and take it out of production. 
 Question:What do we know about the newly discovered gases? 
A. Some are surely produced by the development of agriculture. 
B. The CFCs will have a long impact once they are released. 
C. They gather together in the atmosphere at a medium speed. 
D. Their amounts are not large enough to cause damage to us. 
 Answer: B

Context: Perhaps it is hard to imagine that a bad tooth could be deadly. But doctors in the Washington area say a twelveyearold boy died last month of a tooth infection that spread to his brain. They say it might have been prevented if the boy had received the dental care he needed.
Experts at the National Institutes of Health say good dental care should start at birth. They say breast milk is the best food for the healthy development of teeth. Breast milk can help slow bacterial growth and acid production in the mouth.
When baby's teeth begin to appear,you can clean them with a wet toothbrush. Dentists say it is important to find soft toothbrushes made especially for babies,and use them very gently.
The use of fluoride   to protect teeth is common in many parts of the world. This natural element is often added to drinking water supplies. The fluoride mixes with enamel ,the hard surface on teeth,to help prevent holes,or cavities from forming.
But the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry points out that young children often swallow toothpaste when they brush their teeth. The group notes that swallowing fluoridated toothpaste can cause problems. So young children should be carefully supervised when they brush their teeth. And only a small amount of fluoridated toothpaste,the size of a green pea,should be used.
Parents often wonder what effects sucking a thumb or sucking on a pacifier might have on their baby's teeth. Dental experts generally agree that this is fine early in life.
The American Academy of Family Physicians says most kids stop sucking their thumbs by the age of four. If it continues,the group advises parents to talk to their child's dentist or doctor. It could influence the correct development of permanent teeth. 
 Question:The boy with a bad tooth died because  _  . 
A. his tooth disease was very deadly 
B. the doctor refused to treat him properly 
C. he didn't receive timely treatment 
D. something was wrong with his brain 
 Answer: C

A week later the general heard that his teeth were being sold in curiosity shops as $ 5 each. On each of the teeth there was a label with the name of the general and words: ""Buy these teeth and show them to your friends at home."" The general got angry. He rushed to his office and ordered six officers to go around the city and buy all his teeth.
The officers went out and visited every curiosity shop in the capital. They were away from the office all day. In the evening they returned and put on the table in front of the general the teeth they had bought. They had collected 175 teeth.

Context: The iPhone, the iPad, each of Apple's products sounds cool and has become a fad . Apple has cleverly taken advantage of the power of the letter ""i"" - and many other brands are following suit. The BBC's iPlayer - which allows Web users to watch TV programs on the Internet -adopted the title in 2008. A lovely bear - popular in the US and UK - that plays music and video is called ""iTeddy"". A slimmed-down version of London's Independent newspaper was launched last week under the name ""i"".
In general, single-letter prefixes have been popular since the 1990s, when terms such as e-mail and e-commerce first came into use. 
Most ""i"" products are targeted at young people and considering the major readers of Independent's ""i"", it's no surprise that they've selected this fashionable name. 
But it's hard to see what's so special about the letter ""i"". Why not use ""a"", ""b"", or ""c"" instead? According to Tony Thorne, head of the Language Center at King's College, London, ""i"" works because its meaning has become ambiguous. When Apple uses ""i"", no one knows whether it means Internet, information, individual or interactive, Thorne told BBC Magazines. ""Even when Apple created the iPod, it seems it didn't have one clear definition,"" he says. 
""However, thanks to Apple, the term is now associated with portability."" adds Thorne.
Clearly the letter ""i"" also agrees with the idea that the Western World is centered on the individual. Each person believes they have their own needs, and we love personalized products for this reason. 
Along with ""Google"" and ""blog"", readers of BBC Magazines voted ""i"" as one of the top 20 words that have come to define the last decade. 
But as history shows, people grow tired of fads. From the 1900s to 1990s, products with ""2000"" in their names became fashionable as the year was associated with all things advanced and modern. However, as we entered the new century, the trend inevitably  disappeared. 
 Question:The writer suggests that   _  . 
A. the popularity of ""i"" products may not last long 
B. iTeddy is alive bear 
C. the letter ""b"" replaces letter ""i"" to name the products 
D. ""i"" products are often of high quality

Context: Scientists have recently discovered that mothers tend to hold their baby on the left.Of 255 right-handed mothers,83% held the baby on the left.And out of 32 left-handed women,78%held the baby on the left As a control( ),women were watched coming from supermarkets carrying baby-sized bags;the bags were held with no side preference.
Then,dental   patients were given a large rubber ball to hold during treatment.The majority held the ball to their left side,even when it was interrupted with the dentist's activities.
This suggested that in times of stress objects are held against the left side.
At that point,something clearly contrary was observed.A large number of mothers who brought their premature babies to a clinic were seen to hold their babies against their right side.
So,115 mothers who had been separated from their babies for 24 hours after birth were observed for holding response.The experimenters presented the baby directly to midline of the mother's body, and noted how she held the baby.53% placed the baby on the left and 47% on the right.And it was also noted that the mothers of the group who had held their baby on the left had already had a baby from which they had not been separated after birth.
Left-handed holding enables the baby to hear the heartbeat.In order to discover whether hearing the heart has a beneficial effect on the baby,the sound of a human heart-beat was played to 102 babies in a New York nursery for 4 days.A control group of babies was not exposed to heart-beats.The babies in the heart-beat group gained more weight and cried far less than the babies in the control group. 
 Question:The experiments proved that_. 
A. mothers have an instinct to hold their babies on the left immediately after birth 
B. mothers hold their babies on the left in times of stress 
C. mothers of premature babies do not have the instinct to hold their babies on the left 
D. mothers find it more comfortable to carry their babies on the left because the heart is on that side 
 Answer: C
Context: Hands play an important part in our daily life. But do you know which of your two hands you use more? Very few people use both hands _ well .Most of us are right-handed. Only about five people out of a hundred are left-handed.  New-born babies can take hold of things with either of their hands, but in about two years they usually use their right hands.  Scientists don't know why this happens.
Monkeys are our close relatives  in the animal world. Scientists have found that monkeys like to use one of their hands more than the other, but it can be either hand. There are as many right-handed monkeys as left-handed ones. Next time you visit a zoo, watch the monkeys carefully, you will see that some of them will use their right hands and others will use their left hands. But most of the people use their right hands better and this makes life difficult for those left-handed people. We live in a right-handed world. 
 Question:New-born babies can use  _  .. 
A. both of their hands 
B. neither of their hands 
C. their right hands 
D. their left hands

Context: Tui Na and Your Emotional Health
In Traditional Chinese Medicine the body, mind and spirit cannot be divided and so the unique whole-body treatment in Tui Na can also be a useful treatment correcting any imbalances in the body's energy before symptoms and disease can develop. It also works to restore emotional harmony as well as physical health. This is why after a Tui Na treatment many people ""feel good"". Many people in China use Tui Na regularly to keep healthy and to deal with some specific illnesses.
Tui Na is performed on the clothed body and the patient is either lying on a couch or sitting on a chair. Therapists using a variety of strokes or movements will control the intensity and direction of pressure in an exact way. The unique rolling movement in Tui Na is one of the most difficult strokes to learn and students have to practice sometimes for many months on a rice bag before they are allowed to practice on the human body.
Stress
Tui Na is of course very useful for treating stress.
It distributes the energy around the whole body. It is believed that Tui Na moves the strong energy in the tense muscles to the weaker areas, thus making a more balanced body. When your Qi (energy in the body) flow is balanced you feel relaxed and comfortable.  Tui Na is especially useful for stiff shoulders and tense neck muscles.
Emotions
In Traditional Chinese Medicine each major organ is linked to an emotion. By balancing the energy in the organ, the relevant emotion will be calmed. When your emotions are out of control, you would usually turn to your doctor or perhaps a psychotherapist. But perhaps some people would not like to be seeing a psychotherapist or feel nervous about discussing their problems with others. With Tui Na one does not need to tell the therapist anything one does not want to. The treatment of Tui Na can deal with the problem itself -- although if one does need to talk, then the safe space is there to do so. An active dialogue between the therapist and the patient will help to get a better effect.
How the major organs rule your emotions
Each major organ -- the heart, the stomach, the spleen, the liver, the bladder, the kidneys, the lungs, etc. -- is linked to a relevant emotion.
The heart is linked to joy, excitement and sadness. If the heart is out of balance, the patient may dream a lot at night and often forget something important in the day.
The stomach and spleen are connected with too much thinking or worrying -- over anxiety. When the stomach is out of balance there is often a lack of energy. The patient often feels very tired and has no interest in doing anything at all.
The liver and gall bladder are linked to anger. In Chinese Medicine the eyes are connected with the liver, and many people who suffer from anger often suffer from eye problems. The gall bladder rules decision-making and too much energy here can lead to rashness, while if there is too little it can bring about indecision. Where there is a history of depression, the therapist would look to the liver.
The bladder and kidneys are linked to fear of all kinds, from simple anxieties and phobias to vague fears and worries.
The lungs are connected with feelings of grief and sadness. When there is a history of grief, the therapist would look to the lungs.
Tui Na is used in almost all the hospitals in China and very popular among Chinese people. It is a useful and valuable method of restoring Qi balance, when emotional and physical health is out of balance. Tui Na is one of the remaining secrets of Chinese Medicine. 
 Question:When the stomach is out of balance,  _  . 
A. the patient will have a stomachache 
B. the patient will have a lot to worry about 
C. the patient will have nothing to do 
D. the patient will not feel like doing anything 
 Answer: D
Context: When most of us look at our hands, we might notice that we need to clean, or stop biting our fingernails, and that's about it. But if you ask a doctor, he can see a whole lot more. Everything from poor diet and stress to serious kidney   problems can be revealed by a glance at your fingernails.
There are about 30 different nail signs that can be associated with medical issues, though may indicate more than one problem, according to Dr.Amy Derick, a clinical instructor of dermatology at Northwestern University.
Here are five of the things a doctor can tell about your health based on your fingernails.
1. People who aren't eating well and lack vitamin or dietary may have thinner than normal nails, which are more likely to break.
2.Horizontal   lines are associated with serious physical stress. They frequently occur in people who have gone through chemotherapy .They can also occur after some illnesses, injuries, or with severe malnourishment .Interestingly, there may be an altitude connection too. They've also been found in people who dove 1,000 feet and others who participated in an Everest exploration.
3. Vertical  lines, however, are generally not such a big deal. Some people are more genetically prone to them than others, but they're commonly associated with aging.
4. When people lack iron, their nails can turn spoon-like. Instead of curving down and covering the finger normally, they 'll start to rise up on the sides and front, like the part of a spoon that holds liquid.
5. Kidney and liver problems can create ""half-and-half nails"", where one part of the nail is white and the other part dark or pink, according to Derick.
Doctors note that because disease diagnosis is complex and some symptoms can be associated with different diseases, you should always see a medical professional if you are concerned about something you notice. 
 Question:Who will have horizontal lines on the nails ? 
A. A cancer patient who has received normal treatment. 
B. Hungry African children suffering from severe malnourishment. 
C. An explorer who had reached Zhangjiajie in Hunan Province. 
D. A patient with serious illness, like kidney and liver problems.

Context: If your mother told you to eat carrots so you'd be able to see in the dark, she was right. It turns out that feeding kids carrots is just one of a number of things to keep eyes healthy. Other things include regular eye exams, and sunglasses or hats are also very helpful, experts say.
While eye disease is sometimes hereditary , some are still preventable , said Dr. Ron Weber, an Atlanta-based ophthalmologist. For example, nearsightedness, ""not only has a genetic  component but is also influenced by how kids use their eyes during childhood,"" he told Reuters Health by phone.
He said that extended close work, such as reading, has long been thought to cause nearsightedness. Recent support has come from a study in which people with a higher level of education were more likely to have nearsightedness, because they spend more time reading or working on computers. Another study showed that children who spend more time outdoors are less likely to become nearsighted.
But these findings don't mean kids should be stopped from reading or working on the computer. Instead, Weber suggests, make sure a child's environment is bright enough while they are doing close work. Parents should also help kids get into the habit of holding their reading material at the perfect distance - about 18 to 22 inches, he said. Finally, taking a break every five minutes or so, to let the eyes relax and focus on an object in the distance, will also help.
One of the most important things a parent can do to help _ eye disease and vision problems is to make sure their child gets regular eye exams, beginning early in life. ""The majority of vision problems in children are preventable and treatable,"" said Dr. Ida Chung.

Context: Every living cell contains genes. They are too small to be seen in a microscope, but they are very important. Each set of genes in the body contains all the instructions needed to make a human being. Some genes determine hair color. Some determine the shape of a nose. Some genes help determine your height and even your weight.
Genes are made of a chemical called DNA-the letters stand for deoxyribonucleic acid . In the early 1950's, two scientists, Francis Crick and James Watson, figured out how the parts of DNA fit together. Once scientists understood this structure, it became possible to take pieces of DNA apart and put them together in new ways. New kinds of genes could be made in this manner.
Scientists have studied the genes of many plants and animals. They have worked out which genes affect the color of a tomato and the thickness of its skin. Working out which genes determine which features is called genetic mapping, scientists have begun the Human Genome Project, an ambitious effort to map all the genes in the human body.
Some genes may be defective . For example, something might be wrong with the gene that makes blood clot . A baby born with this defective gene could suffer serious hemorrhages  or even bleed to death because his or her blood fails to clot. If scientists ever learn how to map all the genes in our bodies, they can determine whether or not an unborn child has any defective genes. They might even discover how to treat these genes before the child is born. 
 Question:What is the main idea of this passage? 
A. Defective genes can never be repaired. 
B. Genes are too small to be seen through a microscope. 
C. Genes help scientists understand how living things develop their characteristics. 
D. The Human Genome Project may explain the role of every gene in the body.

Context: Recently hand-foot-mouth disease has spread across China. In the past three months, there have been about 41,846 cases   in 30 provinces and regions. The number is increasing. Eighteen Chinese children have died of the disease so far this year.
What causes the disease and why is it dangerous?
Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common childhood illness. It mainly affects children under the age of 10. It gets its name from the rash   that develops on the hands and feet. It can also cause blisters   in your mouth.
A child who has the disease will usually have a fever, a runny nose and sore throat. He or she doesn't want to eat or drink because of pain in the mouth.
Hand-foot-mouth disease is mostly not serious. The fever and rash clear within a few days. But in some cases, the virus   affects the heart, lungs or brain. This puts the child's life in danger.
A virus causes hand-foot-mouth disease. The disease spreads easily where a lot of young children are together, such as in a child-care center. Sometimes it can also affect teenagers and adults.
In order not to pass on the virus, good hygiene   is important. We should wash our hands as often as possible. Especially we should wash our hands before meals and after going to the toilet. 
 Question:_   can help us to keep away from the hand-foot-mouth disease. 
A. Passing on the virus 
B. Taking children to the child-care center 
C. Keeping your hands clean 
D. Not going to public places 
 Answer: C

Context: It was unusually quiet in the emergency room on December 25.
I was nurse on duty that day. I didn't think there would be any patients, sighing about having to work on Christmas. Just then five bodies showed up at my desk, a pale woman and four small children.
""Are you all sick?"" I asked suspiciously.
""Yes,"" she said weakly and lowered her head.
But when it came to descriptions of their presenting problems, things got a little vague. Two of the children had headaches, but the headaches weren't accompanied by the normal body language of holding the head or trying to keep it still. Two children had earaches, but only one could tell me which ear was affected. The mother complained of a cough but seemed to work to produce it.
Something was wrong, but I didn't say anything but explained that it might be a little while before a doctor saw her. She responded, ""Take your time; it's warm here.""
On a hunch  , I checked the chart after the admitting clerk had finished registering the family. No address---they were homeless. The waiting room was warm.
I looked out at the family huddled by the Christmas tree. The little one was pointing at the television and exclaiming something to her mother. The oldest one was looking at an ornament on the Christmas tree.
I went back to the nurses' station and mentioned we had a homeless family in the waiting room. The nurses, grumbling about working Christmas, turned to compassion for a family just trying to get warm on Christmas. The team went into action, much as we do when there's a medical emergency. But this one was a Christmas emergency.
We were all offered a free meal in the hospital cafeteria on Christmas Day, so we claimed that meal and prepared a banquet for our Christmas guests. We needed presents. We put together oranges and apples in a basket. We collected from different departments candies, crayons and other things available that could be presents. As seriously as we met the physical needs of the patients that came to us that day, our team worked to meet the needs, and exceed the expectations, of a family who just wanted to be warm on Christmas Day.
Later, as the family walked to the door to leave, the four year old came running back, gave me a hug and whispered, ""Thanks for being our angels today."" 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? 
A. Something was wrong with one of the children's heads. 
B. The pale woman forgot to write the address. 
C. The author did not understand the truth. 
D. The children's mother told a lie.

Context: Most children have ever heard their parents yell ""sit up straight!"" or ""don't hang your head !"" when they eat dinner. Nowadays, it is also heard around another activity -- video games. Ten-year-old Owaish admits it takes him three to four hours a day to play games on his tablet computer. In addition, he plays for about two hours on the smart phone every day. As a result, he started suffering a serious pain in the neck around June or July. What's worse the pain has spread to the hand and back gradually, which makes his mother Mehzabin become concerned.
The doctors note the number of young children with the chronic pain  in their necks, arms and shoulders is on the increase sharp in recent years . They are not aging, they haven't had an accident, the blood reports are fine, their X-rays are fine, and their MRIs are fine. Facts have proved that the pain is from the poor posture  while they are playing video games on smart phones or other electronic devices. 19-year -old student Nida feels pain in the finger which holds the weight of her smart phone most of the day. Nida almost uses her smart phone 24/7, which means 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or all the time.
Health experts predict there will be not only physical but mental  problems resulting from the overuse of electronic devices. They encourage people to often take breaks and exercise from using computers, smart phones or other devices. Stand up! Stretch  the legs, back, shoulders and arms in all the possible directions. That's the most effective way and maybe the key to solving the problem completely. After all, the medication doesn't help sometimes.

Context: Every year, World Blood Day is celebrated by blood services worldwide on 14 June, the birthday of Nobel Prize winner Karl Landsteiner, the man who discovered the ABO blood group system. If you have every thought of becoming a blood donor, just register to do it. And you should never worry about the donation.
Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body.
It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients.
First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday.
Although most people are able to give blood, some people who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease are no tasked to be donors. Pregnant women or those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood.
Blood has a very short shelf life. Some blood components can be kept longer than others, for instance red blood cells will keep for 35 days but platelets for only five. Remember, you should wait at least 16 weeks before donating blood again. 
 Question:What component of blood is used to treat burned patients? 
A. Plasma 
B. Red blood cell 
C. Antibody

Context: It's impossible to determine how many people would have lost their lives without the contribution of African-American inventor Dr Charles Drew.
Charles Drew was born on June 3, 1904, in Washington, DC. His early interest was in education, but he was also an outstanding athlete. While in college, he was awarded as the man who contributed the most to sports during his four years in school. Drew's sister Elsie suffered from tuberculosis  and died in 1920. Her death influenced his decision to study medicine.
After becoming a doctor and working as a college instructor, Drew went to Columbia University, where he earned his Doctor of Medical Science degree. During this time he became involved in research on blood and blood transfusions.
At Columbia, he wrote a paper on ""banked blood"", in which he described a technique he developed for the long-term preservation of blood plasma. Before his discovery, blood could not be stored for more than two days because of the rapid breakdown of red blood cells. Drew had discovered that by separating the plasma from the whole blood and then refrigerating them separately, they could be combined a week later for a blood transfusion. Drew became the first African American to receive a PhD in medical science.
After World War II broke out, Drew was called upon to put his techniques into practice. He was named a project director for the American Red Cross but soon quit his post after the government issued an order that blood taken from white donors should be separated from that of black donors.
On April 1, 1950, after he attended the annual free clinic at the John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, he and other three physicians decided to drive back home. As he was tired from spending the night before in the operating room, he lost control of his car. Drew was badly injured and was taken to Alamance General Hospital in Burlington, North Carolina. He was pronounced dead half an hour after he first received medical attention. Drew's funeral was held on April 5, 1950, at the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church in Washington, DC.
But contrary to popular thought, he was not refused a blood transfusion by an all-white hospital. He indeed received a transfusion but was beyond the help of the doctors attending to him. As Dr. John Ford, one of the doctors who survived the accident, later explained, ""We all received the very best of care. The fact that he was a Black did not in any way limit the care that was given to him."" Over the years, Drew has been considered one of the most honored figures in the medical field. 
 Question:According to the passage,   _   might have contributed to the invention of blood banks. 
A. the combination of blood cells 
B. the rapid breakdown of red blood cells 
C. the development of refrigerating technique 
D. the technique of separating plasma from the whole blood

Context: The technology is great. Without it we wouldn't have been able to put a man on the moon, explore the ocean's depths or eat microwave sausages. Computers have revolutionized our lives and they have the power to educate and pass on knowledge. But sometimes this power can create more problems than it solves.
Every doctor has had to try their best to calm down patients who've come into their surgery waving an Internet print-out, convinced that they have some rare incurable disease, say, throat cancer. The truth is usually far more ordinary, though: they don't have throat cancer, and it's just that their throats are swollen. Being a graduate of the Internet ""school"" of medicine does not guarantee accurate self-health-checks.
One day Mrs. Almond came to my hospital after feeling faint at work. While I took her blood sample and tried to find out what was wrong, she said calmly, ""I know what's wrong;I've got throat cancer. I know there's nothing you doctors can do about it and I've just got to wait until the day comes.""
As a matter of routine I ordered a chest X-ray. I looked at it and the blood results an hour later. Something wasn't right. ""Did your local doctor do an X-ray?"" I asked. ""Oh, I haven't been to the doctor for years,"" she replied. ""I read about it on a website and the symptoms fitted, so I knew that's what I had.""
However, some of her symptoms, like the severe cough and weight loss, didn't fit with it--but she'd just ignored this.
I looked at the X-ray again, and more tests confirmed it wasn't the cancer but tuberculosis  --something that most certainly did need treating, and could be deadly. She was lucky we caught it when we did.
Mrs. Almond went pale when I explained she would have to be on treatment for the next six months to ensure that she was fully recovered. It was certainly a lesson for her. "" _ ,"" she said, shaking her head, as I explained that all the people she had come into close contact with would have to be found out and tested. She listed up to about 20, and then I went to my office to type up my notes. Unexpectedly, the computer was not working, so I had to wait until someone from the IT department came to fix it. Typical. Maybe I should have a microwave sausage while I waited?

A. to have contacted many friends 
B. to have recovered in a short time

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. ""

Context: One baby born with a defective windpipe   now has hope of breathing normally thanks to 3-D printing technology, NPR reported.
Garrett Peterson, now 18 months old, was born with tracheomalacia  , leaving him unable to breathe. The condition terrified his parents, who turned to specialist Dr. Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment.
Along with Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer who runs the university's 3-D printing lab, Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett's windpipe until it's strong enough to function independently. After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the ""splint"" with a 3-D printer.
""It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,"" Green told NPR.
On January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs?
Though he still remains in the hospital, Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery.  His parents are overjoyed, saying he's starting to act more interactive and alert.
As Garrett grows, the splint will expand and eventually dissolve in his body as his own windpipe strengthens enough to work independently.
3-D printing technology has allowed doctors to help patients in ways that they hope will continue to grow.
""We're talking about taking something like dust and converting it into body parts,"" Green said. ""And we're able to do things that were never possible before."" 
 Question:According to the passage, doctors' attitude toward 3-D printing technology in medical care is   _  . 
A. positive 
B. negative 
C. unknown 
D. indifferent

Context: I was in my first year of college, making friends and enjoying life, but then my whole world turned upside down. I had a heart attack. It felt like someone was stabbing   me in the chest with a knife over and over again.
After three months of rest I went back to college, but then things took a turn for the worse. I was staying at my Nana's house and woke up in the middle of the night with a terrible pain in my chest. I knew I was having a heart attack again.
I couldn't even shout for help. Luckily my grandpa was going to the toilet and heard me falling out of bed. If it wasn't for him, I probably wouldn't be here.
The two holes in my heart were causing the problems and I needed an operation immediately to repair them. Unfortunately, the surgery didn't go well and they only managed to repair one of the holes.
When I woke up from the operation, I had a really dry mouth and couldn't wait to have something to eat and drink. The biggest shock of all came when I was told that I needed a heart transplant and was put on the register. The doctors were stunned at how quickly heart failure came on - it usually takes years, but it took my heart less than six months to get to that stage. My whole world came crashing down, but I stayed strong. It was a choice between crying every day and getting on with my life.
As time went on, life became even harder. I hated feeling weak all the time and needing help with everything. It got to the point where I thought I would never get a new heart. I was diagnosed with depression.
Even though I thought that Christmas 2008 would be my last, I really enjoyed it and even had a good New Year. Everyone was crying for me when the clock struck midnight and they told me to keep fighting.
A week later, I got a call from the doctors saying they'd found a suitable donor  . My wish came true and thankfully the operation went well. I spent four hours in surgery where they took out my old heart and put a new one in. When I woke up I burst out crying. I had a second chance at life. 
 Question:When the author learned that he needed a heart transplant, he   _  . 
A. couldn't help crying every day 
B. chose to continue to fight for his life 
C. felt so depressed that he tried to kill himself 
D. was so anxious that his heart failure developed very quickly

Context: Smaller than your fist, your healthy heart just goes on and on. It will beat more than 60 times a minute for 70 years or more. That's something that most of us take for granted. But it's an amazing fact.
60 times a minute for 60 minutes is 3,600 times. What physical thing can most of us do 3,600 times in one hour? Blink? Maybe. Tap our fingers on the desk? No. Jump up and down? Certainly not! But our heart keeps beating, hour after hour. Every day, it pumps almost 2,000 gallons of blood through our blood vessels . It takes you about five years to drink 2,000 gallons of water.
And, unlike your knees or your back, your heart does all this work without ever complaining ! You never know that it's even there. Your heart is such a reliable ""silent partner"" that people forget to care for it. For many, the first indication that their heart isn't working properly is a serious heart illness! Over 650,000 Americans die of some kind of heart disease every year. Cancer kills 560,000, stroke kills 143,000, and accidents kill 118,000 Americans annually.
Like accidental deaths, many heart disease-related deaths can be avoided if people simply follow the advice of the experts. Unfortunately, most people seem to listen to a little voice in their head that says, ""It won't happen to me. "" So these people keep on smoking and drinking. They continue to eat too much meat. And their only ""exercise"" is getting off the sofa to get something out of the fridge. Please follow the following steps to keep your heart healthy.

Context: Many people have never heard of Mesothelioma and are unaware of its symptoms. Although considered a rare form of cancer, each year the number of cases grows. With the prevalence of this disease on the rise, it is critical to understand why and how Mesothelioma develops and what courses of action can be taken in the event of diagnosis. The following is a list of frequently asked questions and answers that will provide you with some information on Mesothelioma, and the legal issues surrounding it.
What is Mesothelioma?
Mesothelioma is the term used to describe a cancerous tumor found in the mesothelial cells of an organ. The organs where this form of cancer is most commonly found are the lungs, heart and abdominal organs. Pleural Mesothelioma is cancer of the lung lining(,)and is the most common form of Mesothelioma.
What causes Mesothelioma?
Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos . Asbestos is often found in building materials used before the mid 1970's. In addition, materials such as pipes, boiler insulation, floor, ceiling and roof tiles may contain asbestos.
How much asbestos exposure will cause Mesothelioma?
Generally, the probability of developing this form of cancer is in accordance with the length of time you are exposed to asbestos. Also, your health is at risk if your exposure to asbestos is intense. It should be noted that Mesothelioma has a latency period of 20 to 50 years. This means that you may develop the disease long after your exposure to asbestos. On average, people tend to develop Mesothelioma somewhere between 35 and 40 years after exposure.
How quickly does Mesothelioma progress?
The onset of Mesothelioma is quite slow. Patients will begin to experience symptoms such as lower back pain and chest pain. These symptoms may also be accompanied by weight loss, fever and difficulty breathing. Unfortunately, once Mesothelioma develops, it quickly becomes aggressive and treatment must be sought immediately.
Can Mesothelioma be treated?
Doctors are able to use several traditional methods of cancer treatment for Mesothelioma, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Like all forms of cancer, detecting the disease at the earliest stage possible greatly increases the patient's chances for survival. If you have worked in an industry such as construction or suspect that you may have been exposed to asbestos, be alert for symptoms and contact your doctor immediately.
What legal courses of action can be taken?
Anyone suffering from Mesothelioma is entitled to compensation from asbestos manufacturers. Additionally, if you are the spouse or child of someone who has died from Mesothelioma, you are entitled to file a claim and seek compensation. 
 Question:Which of the following would be the best title for the text? 
A. Terrible Mesothelioma 
B. Mesothelioma is around us 
C. Frequently Asked Questions About Mesothelioma 
D. Mesothelioma in on the rise

Context: The oldest forms of medicine are enjoying a comeback. Modern holistic  medicine is an approach that treats the whole patient, not just the disease. It is a way to maintain good health rather than cure illness. The most important influences on today's holistic medicine are ancient Chinese medicine and Indian Ayurvedic medicine, both of which promoted the whole body health.
Holistic medicine usually combines diet, physical exercise and meditation, together with other alternative techniques such as massage  and acupuncture . Herbal treatment ,a practice of treating illness by using plants, is influenced by the writings of Culpeper as well as Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine. Homeopathy is one of the forms of holistic medicine which is widely practiced in Europe and the USA. Homeopathy began in Germany in the early 1800s, when Samuel Hahnemann described how very tiny doses of a drug had an effect on his patients. According to Hahnemann, the more the drug was diluted , the stronger its effects. The substance selected would produce similar effects to the disease itself if given in large doses. In the UK homeopathy is regarded as a non-traditional but just about acceptable treatment.
Meditation and contemplation have an important role in holistic medicine. They were brought to Europe by Indian teachers who combined Indian Ayurvedic medicine with Western beliefs. Transcendental meditation is one of the best known of these techniques. People repeat words inside their head to reach a state of deep relaxation.
       The holistic movement has made many doctors look at the whole patient, not just the disease. Life-style, emotional problems and diet are just some of the factors that can affect a person's health. Holistic medicine emphasizes good diet, exercise and fresh air, all of which contribute to health. Some clinics now offer holistic medicine along with traditional treatments, so that their patients can choose a combination of treatments that suits them. One problem with holistic medicine is that it is difficult for people to be sure a doctor is reliable. To solve this, many countries want alternative doctors to form professional bodies. 
 Question:The principle of homeopathy is that   _  . 
A. the large doses of medicine will take better effect 
B. the disease will be cured sooner by taking larger doses of medicine 
C. a small thinner dose of medicine will be more effective 
D. the doses of medicine depend on how serious the illness is 
 Answer: C
Context: You might not know it, but there is something wonderful at your fingertips. You can make people happier, healthier and more hard-working just by touching their arms or holding their hands.
Doctors say that body contact is a kind of medicine that can work wonders. When people are touched, the quantity of hemoglobin  -a type of matter that produces the red color in blood increases greatly. This results in more oxygen reaching every part of the body and the whole body benefits. In experiments, bottle-fed baby monkeys were separated from their mothers for the first ten days of life. They became sad and negative. Studies showed the monkeys were more probable to become ill than other babies that were allowed to stay with their mothers.
Human babies react in much the same way. Some years ago, a scientist noticed that some well-fed babies in a clean nursery became weak. Yet babies in another nursery were growing healthily, even though they ate less well and were not kept as clean. The reason, he concluded, was that they often had touches from nurses.
Experiments show that most people like being touched. And nearly all doctors believe touch helps to reduce patients' fear of treatment. Of course there is time when a touch is not welcome. But even if we don't like being touched, a smile can make us feel better. Smiling increases blood flow and starts the production of ""happy brain"" chemicals. So let's have a big smile and don't forget to keep in touch. 
 Question:According to the passage   _  . 
A. human brains need oxygen and blood supply now and then 
B. touches from doctors and nurses have nothing to do with treatment 
C. new-born baby monkeys should stay away from their mothers 
D. not all the people like being touched 
 Answer: D
Context: People should go outside and absorb some sunshine to help increase their vitamin D levels, some experts say. Arthritis Research UK. which is a British medical research organization dedicated to curing arthritis  , says vitamin D deficiency can cause bone loss, muscle function problems and, in some cases, rickets   in children.
The government recommends vitamin D supplements   for pregnant women and children aged under five. But on sunny days, a few minutes outdoors should achieve the same results, Arthritis Research UK says.
Figures show that up to a quarter of the population has low levels of vitamin D in their blood and the majority of pregnant women do not take vitamin D supplements. People aged over 65, pregnant and breast-feeding women and children aged six months to five years old are thought to be most at risk.
Vitamin D is essential to help the body absorb calcium   from food. Low levels of vitamin D can result in serious problems.
Alan Silman, the medical director of Arthritis Research UK, said, ""When the days are sunny, go out for a few minutes and expose your face and arms to the sunshine."" But he also had a warning on overexposure. ""Don't allow your skin to go red, and take care not to burn, particularly in strong sunshine and if you have fair or sensitive skin. From June to August, just 15 minutes is generally enough time.""
""In less sunny months,"" Alan Silman added, ""we recommend that people add more vitamin D in their diet by eating more oily fish such as salmon, tuna, and foods rich in vitamin D, such as cereals  ."" 
 Question:Lack of vitamin D may cause the following problems EXCEPT   _  . 
A. bone loss 
B. muscle function problems 
C. rickets in children. 
D. high blood pressure 
 Answer: D
Context: Tui Na and Your Emotional Health
In Traditional Chinese Medicine the body, mind and spirit cannot be divided and so the unique whole-body treatment in Tui Na can also be a useful treatment correcting any imbalances in the body's energy before symptoms and disease can develop. It also works to restore emotional harmony as well as physical health. This is why after a Tui Na treatment many people ""feel good"". Many people in China use Tui Na regularly to keep healthy and to deal with some specific illnesses.
Tui Na is performed on the clothed body and the patient is either lying on a couch or sitting on a chair. Therapists using a variety of strokes or movements will control the intensity and direction of pressure in an exact way. The unique rolling movement in Tui Na is one of the most difficult strokes to learn and students have to practice sometimes for many months on a rice bag before they are allowed to practice on the human body.
Stress
Tui Na is of course very useful for treating stress.
It distributes the energy around the whole body. It is believed that Tui Na moves the strong energy in the tense muscles to the weaker areas, thus making a more balanced body. When your Qi (energy in the body) flow is balanced you feel relaxed and comfortable.  Tui Na is especially useful for stiff shoulders and tense neck muscles.
Emotions
In Traditional Chinese Medicine each major organ is linked to an emotion. By balancing the energy in the organ, the relevant emotion will be calmed. When your emotions are out of control, you would usually turn to your doctor or perhaps a psychotherapist. But perhaps some people would not like to be seeing a psychotherapist or feel nervous about discussing their problems with others. With Tui Na one does not need to tell the therapist anything one does not want to. The treatment of Tui Na can deal with the problem itself -- although if one does need to talk, then the safe space is there to do so. An active dialogue between the therapist and the patient will help to get a better effect.
How the major organs rule your emotions
Each major organ -- the heart, the stomach, the spleen, the liver, the bladder, the kidneys, the lungs, etc. -- is linked to a relevant emotion.
The heart is linked to joy, excitement and sadness. If the heart is out of balance, the patient may dream a lot at night and often forget something important in the day.
The stomach and spleen are connected with too much thinking or worrying -- over anxiety. When the stomach is out of balance there is often a lack of energy. The patient often feels very tired and has no interest in doing anything at all.
The liver and gall bladder are linked to anger. In Chinese Medicine the eyes are connected with the liver, and many people who suffer from anger often suffer from eye problems. The gall bladder rules decision-making and too much energy here can lead to rashness, while if there is too little it can bring about indecision. Where there is a history of depression, the therapist would look to the liver.
The bladder and kidneys are linked to fear of all kinds, from simple anxieties and phobias to vague fears and worries.
The lungs are connected with feelings of grief and sadness. When there is a history of grief, the therapist would look to the lungs.
Tui Na is used in almost all the hospitals in China and very popular among Chinese people. It is a useful and valuable method of restoring Qi balance, when emotional and physical health is out of balance. Tui Na is one of the remaining secrets of Chinese Medicine.

A. the patient will have a stomachache 
B. the patient will have a lot to worry about

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. "" 
 Question:Jennie gave her bone marrow to   _  . 
A. a close friend 
B. a stranger 
C. a classmate 
D. a 
 Answer: B
Context: Darek Fidyka, a 38-year-old Bulgarian, had been paralyzed   from the chest down for four years after a knife attack. Scientists from Britain and Poland took cells from his nose, transplanted   them into his back and re-grew his spinal cord  . Now he can walk and even drive a car. The doctors were delighted but said it was the first step in a long journey.
The breakthrough came after 40 years of research by Professor Geoff Raisman, who found that cells had the possibility to repair damage to nasal   nerves, the only part of the nervous system that constantly re-grows. ""The idea was to take something from an area where the nervous system can repair itself and put it into an area that doesn't repair itself,"" Professor Raisman said.
Polish doctors injected   the nasal cells into Mr Fidyka's spinal cord above the injury and used some nerves from his ankle to form a bridge across the damaged tissue. The nasal cells appear to have caused the spinal nerves to repair themselves.
Professor Raisman achieved this with rats in the late 1990's, but this is his greatest success. ""I think the moment of discovery for me was Christmas in 1997 when I first saw a rat, which couldn't control its hand, put its hand out to me. That was an exciting moment, because I realized then that my belief that the nervous system could be repaired was true.""
Doctors chose the easiest case for their first attempt--it might not work for others. But there is a real sense of hope that an idea once thought impossible has been realized.
David Nicholls, who helped provide money for the breakthrough, said information about the breakthrough would be made available to researchers across the globe.
""What you've got to understand is that for three million paralyzed people in the world today, the world looks a totally brighter place than it did yesterday,"" he said. 
 Question:What made Professor Geoff Raisman begin to believe the nervous system can be repaired? 
A. His former study with other people. 
B. His operation on a paralyzed patient. 
C. His sudden thought about Christmas. 
D. His unusual experience with a sick rat.

Context: It is the 22ndcentury  and it is very popular to change people's bodies.
Mr. Smith decided to change his body. He changed his big nose to a small one, and his old and gray hair to short and blond hair. He also bought new green eyes, new hands, new arms, new knees and new feet. Mrs. Smith was happy because Mr. Smith's new feet didn't smell as bad as his old feet.
However, something bad happened. One morning, Mr. Smith woke up and his new nose didn't work. The next morning he couldn't hear anything. Then his new blond hair went gray, and his new knees didn't move. And finally he could see nothing with his green eyes.
It was really terrible. Mr. Smith wanted his old body back. However, he had to pay 100,000 euro  for his old body.
It was expensive but Mr. Smith still got his own body back. He would never follow the fashion.

Context: Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do. 
 Question:Ray Birdwhistell believes that physical appearance   _  . 
A. has little to do with culture 
B. has much to do with culture 
C. is ever changing 
D. is different from place to place 
 Answer: B
Context: Dr.Michael Prager, a leading Botox expert, said that a growing number of women are developing something called ""computer face"".He also mentioned that professionals who worked long hours in front of a screen were ending up with saggy jowls , ""turkey neck"" and deep-set wrinkles on their forehead and around their eyes.
The Botox expert said that, of all his clients, office workers were most likely to show premature signs of ageing.""If you are one of the unfortunate people who frown while you are concentrating on the screen then, over time, you will inevitably end up with frown lines,"" Dr.Prager said.""What is perhaps more surprising is the number of women with saggy jowls because they are sitting in one position for so long.If you spend most of the time looking down then the neck muscles shorten and go saggy, eventually giving you a second neck.""
Dr.Prager, who has a practice near Harley Street in London, said he encourages his clients to put a mirror next to their computer so they can see if they are frowning at the screen.""When people are stressed or thinking hard about something, then they will often put on a 'grumpy face' without even knowing what they are doing.When my clients put a mirror next to their desk, they are often shocked by the angry, frowning face which stares back at them.""
He said, ""The women I am seeing at the moment have only been using computers at work for the last decade or so.But women in their 20s have grown up with them and use them for every single task.I think the problem is going to become much, much worse.In another ten years, they could be looking quite awful.""
Dr.Prager said there were several simple steps which could avoid ""computer face"" such as regular screen breaks and stretching the neck muscles.And, of course, there was always Botox.He said that, after a couple of sessions of Botox, the habit of ""grumpy face"" could be broken. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the following are signs of ageing?

Context: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog.
Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation.
""The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,"" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery.
The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are ""extremely difficult, if not impossible"" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said.
The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face.
The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants,
Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue.
Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality
There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers.
Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant. 
 Question:The best title for the passage would be   _  . 
A. French Woman has First Partial Face Transplant 
B. First Face Transplant Opens Debate 
C. Risks and Ethical Problems of a Face Transplant

Context: My mother fought cancer for almost a decade and died at 56. She held out long enough to meet the first of her grandchildren and to hold him in her arms. But my other children will never have the chance to know her and experience how loving and gracious she was.
We often speak of ""Mommy's mommy,"" and I find myself trying to explain the illness that took her away from us. They have asked if the same could happen to me. I have always told them not to worry, but the truth is that I carry a ""faulty"" gene, BRCA1, which sharply increases my risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian  cancer.
My doctors estimated that I had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman.
Once I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much as I could. I started with the breasts, as my risk of breast cancer is higher than my risk of ovarian cancer, and the surgery is more complex.
On April 27, I finished the three months of medical procedures. During that time I have been able to keep this private and to carry on with my work. But I am writing about it now because I hope that other women can benefit from my experience. Cancer is still a word that strikes fear into people's hearts, producing a deep sense of powerlessness. But today it is possible to find the way out through a blood test whether you are highly susceptible to breast and ovarian cancer, and then take action.
My own process began on February 2. The operation took eight hours. Then I woke up with tubes in my breasts. It did feel like a scene out of a science-fiction film. But days after surgery I can be back to a normal life. There have been many advances in this procedure in the last few years, and the results can be beautiful.
I wanted to write this to tell other women that the decision to have a surgery operation was not easy. But it is one I am very happy that I made. My chances of developing breast cancer have dropped from 87 percent to under 5 percent. I can tell my children that they don't need to fear they will lose me.
It is a comfort that they see nothing that makes them scared. They can see my small scars and that's it. Everything else is just Mommy, the same as she always was. And they know that I love them and I will do anything to be with them as long as I can. On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. 
For any woman reading this, I hope it helps you to know you have options. I want to encourage every woman, especially if you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, to seek out the information and medical experts who can help you through this aspect of your life, and to make your own informed choices.
I acknowledge that there are many wonderful holistic doctors working on alternatives to surgery. My own regimen  will be posted in due course on the Web site of the Pink Lotus Breast Center. I hope that this will be helpful to other women.
I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they can take measures.
Life comes with many challenges. The ones that should not scare us are the ones we can take on and take control of.

Context: The vitamins necessary for a healthy body are normally supplied by a good mixed diet, including a variety of fruits and green vegetables. It is only when people try to live on a very _ diet, say that when trying to lose weight, that it is necessary to make special provisions to supply the missing vitamins.
An example of the dangers of a restricted diet may be seen in the disease known as ""beri-beri"", which used to make large numbers of Eastern people who lived mainly on rice suffer. In the early years of last century, a Dutch scientist named Eijkman was trying to discover the cause of beri-beri. At first he thought it was transmitted by a germ   . He was working in a Japanese hospital, where the patients were fed on polished rice which had had the outer coverings removed from the grain, it was thought this would be easier for weak and sick people to digest.
Eijkman thought his germ theory was proved when he noticed the chickens in the hospital yard, which were fed on remains from the patients' plates, were also showing signs of the disease. He then tried to separate the germ, which he thought was causing the disease, but his experiments were interrupted by a hospital official, who ordered that the rice without coverings, even though left over by the patients, was too good for chickens. It should be recooked for the patients, and the chickens should be fed on cheap, rough rice with the outer coverings still on the grain.
Eijkman noticed that the chickens began to recover on the new diet. He began to consider the possibility that eating unmilled rice   somehow prevented or cured beri-beri--even that a lack of some ingredient   in the coverings may be the cause of the disease. Indeed this was the case. The element needed to prevent beri-beri was shortly afterwards separated from rice coverings and is now known as vitamin B. The milled rice, though more expensive, was in fact causing the disease the hospital was trying to cure. Nowadays, this terrible disease is much less common thanks to our knowledge of vitamins. 
 Question:What do we know about the disease beri-beri? 
A. It killed large numbers of people. 
B. It resulted from lack of vitamins. 
C. It was transmitted by milled rice. 
D. It was caused by diseased chickens.

Context: When should a child start learning to read and write? This is one of the questions I am most frequently asked. There is no hard and fast rule, for no two are alike, and it would be wrong to set a time when all should start being taught the intricacies of reading letters to form words.
If a three-year-old wants to read(or even a two-year-old for that matter), the child has the right to be given every encouragement. The fact that he or she might later be ""bored"" when joining a class of non-readers at child school is the teacher's affair. It is up to the teacher to see that such a child is given more advanced reading material.
Similarly, the child who still cannot read by the time he goes to junior school at the age of seven should be given every help by teachers and parents alike. They should make certain that he is not dyslexic(having difficulty in reading).
Although parents should be careful not to force youngsters aged two to five to learn to read( if badly done it could put them off reading for life ), there is no harm in preparing them for simple recognition of letters by labeling various items in their rooms. For instance, tie a nice piece of cardboard to their bed with BED written in neat, big letters.
Should the young child ask his parents to teach him to read, and if the parents are capable of doing so, such an attraction should not be ignored. But the task should never be made to look like a hard job and the child should never be forced to continue, or his interest should start to flag. 
 Question:The writer suggests that   _  . 
A. children should ask their parents to teach them to read 
B. children starting to read should ask specialists for help 
C. children should be taught with patience, care and a sense of humor. 
D. children should not feel bored if given advanced reading material 
 Answer: C
Context: When children learn a language, they learn the grammar as well as words or vocabulary. No one teaches them; children just "" _ "".
Before babies begin to produce words, they produce sounds. Some of these sounds will remain if they occur in the language being learned, and others will disappear. This is called the ""babbling stage"".
A child does not learn the language ""all at once"". The child first speaks only one-word ""sentences"". After a few months, the two-word stage arises. During this stage, the child puts two words together. These two-word sentences have definite patterns and express grammatical and meaningful relationships. Still later, in the telegraphic stage, the child will produce longer sentences. These longer sentences are mainly made up of content words. The child's early grammar lacks many of the rules of the adult grammar, but gradually it will become perfect.
All normal children everywhere learn language. This ability is not dependent on race, social class, geography, or even intelligence  . This ability is uniquely   for human. 
 Question:This passage is mainly about   _  . 
A. differences between a child's language and an adult's

Context: Watch a baby between six and nine months old,and you will observe the basic idea of geometry being learned.Once the baby has mastered the idea that space is three dimensional ,it reaches out and begins grasping various things,that the ideas of sets and numbers are formed.So far,so good.But now an _ development takes place.The nerver fibers in the brain separate themselves in such a way that the baby begins to hear sounds very exactly.Soon it picks up language.And it is then brought into direct communication with grown-ups.From this point on,it is usually downhill all the way for mathematics,because the child now becomes exposed to all the rubbish words and beliefs of the born.Nature,having done very well by the child to this point,having permitted it the luxury of thinking for itself for eighteen months,now gives it up to the unreasonable conventions and beliefs of society.But at least the child knows something of geometry and peaceful days,no matter what vicissitudes it may suffer later on.The main reservoir of mathematical ability in any society is thus possessed by children who are about two years old,children who have just learned to speak freely.

Context: Recently Cathy Hagner sadly finds that life for her and her three children is set to permanent fast-forward.
Their full school day and her job as a lawyer's assistant are busy enough. But Hanger also has to take the two boys to soccer or hockey or basketball while dropping off her daughter at piano lessons or Girl Scout Club.
Often, the exhausted family doesn't get home until 7 pm. There is just time for a quick supper before homework. In today's world, middle-class American and British parents treat their children as if they are competitors racing for some finishing line.
Parents take their children from activity to activity in order to make their future bright. It seems that raising a genius has become a more important goal than raising a happy and well-balanced child.
""Doctors across the country are reporting a growing number of children suffering from stomachaches and headaches due to exhaustion and stress,"" says child expert William Doherty of the University of Minnesota.
Teachers are dealing with exhausted kids in the classroom. It's a very serious problem. Many children attend after-school clubs by necessity. But competitive pressures also create an explosion of activities. They include sports, language, music and math classes for children as young as four.
""There is a new parenting trend under way which says that you have to tap all your child's potential at a young age; otherwise you will let him down,"" says Terry Apter, a Cambridge-based child and adolescent psychiatrist .
""It isn't entirely new: there have always been pushy parents. But what was previously seen as strange behavior is now well accepted.""

Context: Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do.

A. has little to do with culture 
B. has much to do with culture

Context: The big red American car was much too wide for an English country road. When Jack saw it running towards him, he stopped his own car at the side of the road to make room for it to pass. The American car went slowly past, so close that he could see the driver's face clearly.
""Where have I seen that face before?"" he though. ""Wait a minute! I remember now. It was in the newspaper!"" He took all the newspapers from his bag and turned quickly to the middle page. There was a picture of the face in it. Yes, it had a large mouth and small eyes, and his eyes were behind dark glasses.
""Wanted by the police,"" read by Jack. ""The city Bank will give a lot of money to anyone who helps the police to catch this man.""

Context: Fat on human body is distributed   in two different ways. Some fat people have a large chest and no waistline  , looking rather like apples. Others are fatter below the waist,  looking more like pears.
      Doctors in Cambridge, England have been examining the relationship between health and fat  distribution. They find that the pear-shaped fat people have fewer problems than the apple-shaped  people. What seems to be most important is not just how much fat you have but where you have it. The doctors measured the apple-shaped women and pear-shaped women and examined them  with X-ray scanners (X). Human beings have two types of fat, one is outside fat that is the fat below the skin and the other is inside fat that lies inside the body. Using the X-ray scanners, the doctors found that the ""apples"" have a large amount of inside fat. If this inside fat is  much more than outside fat, it will probably cause health problems such as obesity  . The best treatment for obesity is to reduce the inside fat. But unfortunately diet treatment  simply makes an apple-shaped person into a smaller apple and a pear-shaped person into a smaller pear. At the moment there is no effective way of reducing the inside fat. 
 Question:The basic reason why some people suffer from obesity is that 
A. they take very little exercise every day 
B. they eat too much 
C. they are examined by X-ray scanners quite often 
D. they have much more inside fat

Context: Women are friendly. But men are more competitive. Why? Researchers have found it's all down to the hormone oxytocin . Although known as the love hormone, it affects the sexes differently.
""Women tend to be social in their behavior. They often share with others. But men tend to be competitive. They are trying to improve their social status,"" said Professor Ryan.
Generally, people believe that the hormone exytocin is let out in our body in various social situations and our body creates a large amount of it during positive social interaction such as falling in love or giving birth.
But in a previous experiment Professor Ryan found that the hormone is also let out in our body during negative social interactions such as envy.
Further researches showed that in men the hormone oxytocin improves the ability to recognize competitive relationships, but in women it raises the ability to recognize friendship.
Professor Ryan's recent experiment used 62 men and women aged 20 to 37.
Half of the participants received oxytocin. The other half received placebo . [( )] [( :Love my Dog.)] 
After a week, the two groups switched with participants. They went through the same procedure with the other material.
Following each treatment, they were shown some video pictures with different social interactions. Then they were asked to analyze the relationships by answering some questions. The questions were about telling friendship from competition. And their answers should be based on gestures, body language and facial expressions.
The results indicated that, after treatment with oxytocin, men's ability to correctly recognize competitive relationships improved, but in women it was the ability to correctly recognize friendship that got better.
Professor Ryan thus concluded: ""Our experiment proves that the hormone oxytocin can raise people's abilities to better distinguish different social interactions. And the behavior differences between men and women are caused by biological factor that are mainly hormonal."" 
 Question:Why did Professor Ryan conduct the recent experiment? 
A. To test the effect of oxytocin on the ability to recognize social interactions. 
B. To know the differences between friendship and competition. 
C. To know people's different abilities to answer questions. 
D. To test people's understanding of body language.

Context: Since ancient times, people have known about its ability to reduce pain and high body temperature. More than 2000 years ago, the Greek doctor Hippocrates advised his patients to chew on the bark and leaves of the willow.
The tree contains a chemical called salicin . From salicin, researchers in the 1800s discovered how to make salicylic acid . And in 1897, a chemist named Felix Hoffmann at Friedrich Bayer and Company in Germany created acetyl salicylic acid. Later it became the active substance in a new medicine that Bayer called aspirin. The ""a"" came from acetyl. The ""spir"" came from the spirea plant, which also produces salicin. And the ""in"" Well, that is a common way to end medicine names.
In 1982, a British scientist shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in part for discovering how aspirin works. Sir John Vane found that aspirin blocks the body from making natural substances called prostaglandins .Prostaglandins have several effects on the body. Some cause pain and the expansion, or swelling( ; ), of damaged tissue. Others protect the lining of the stomach and small intestine. Prostaglandins also make the heart, kidneys and blood vessels  work well. But there is a problem. Aspirin works against all prostaglandins, good and bad. Scientists learned how aspirin interferes with an enzyme . One form of this enzyme makes the prostaglandin that causes pain and swelling. Another form of the enzyme creates a protective effect. So aspirin can reduce pain and swelling in damaged tissues. But it can also harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine . 
 Question:What can we know about aspirin according to the passage? 
A. Aspirin can treat almost diseases. 
B. Aspirin can create the protective enzyme. 
C. Aspirin can harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
D. Aspirin can protect the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
 Answer: C
Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle?

Context: The H1Nl virus has been spreading world-wide,it is important for us to know how to control it.Please pay attention to the following points:
1.Don't touch your face.Above all,keep your hands away from your eyes,mouth and nose,all of which serve pathways  for the viruses  to enter your body.
2.Wash your hands.If you have to touch your face,wash your hands,getting under the fingernails for 20 to 30 seconds with hot soap and water before.Soaps with surfactants  can deal with flu viruses.
3.Cover your nose and mouth.When someone sneezes or coughs,liquid  drops with flu viruses as far as three feet through the air and land on your nose and mouth,so it's best to keep at least an arm's length distance when talking to someone who shows signs of infection .In order to protect others,cover your mouth and nose with a tissue  when you cough or sneeze,and clean your hands afterward.Viruses can live for hours,or even longer when on the skin or other surfaces such as keyboards.
4.Consider buying a mask in case you need it in the future.Some research suggests that masks reduce the risk of getting the flu viruses by as much as 80%.But it also suggests that if you don't wash hands,the mask doesn't work well.So wash your hands and use the mask,especially wearing face masks in crowded places is also useful.

Context: Do you know you could get sick just by walking past a building? The bacteria  that cause Legionnaire's disease grow very fast in large modern buildings. They are carried by air through the buildings and outside. Legionnaire s disease is only one of the illnesses that are caused by ""sick buildings"".
Some buildings can make you ill because their heating and air-conditioning  are controlled . Air from outside cannot get in through the closed windows; This indoor air pollution is a growing problem.
Legionnaire's disease may be the most serious result of sick buildings, but other unpleasant illnesses can appear.People who work in some buildings suffer  from tiredness, feeling sick and headaches. Their offices look bright and clean, but invisible  and dangerous bacteria are in the air around them.
There is an answer to the problem. The air-conditioning and heating can be tested for bacteria. _ This is expensive to do, but the results are good. The people in the buildings no longer get sick, and everybody is happier. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE? 
A. Legionnaire's disease is only one of the results of ""sick buildings"". 
B. There is less and less indoor air pollution. 
C. The bacteria are not dangerous if the offices look bright and clean. 
D. If the tests for bacteria are expensive. the results are good. .

Context: Doctors fighting malaria---one of the deadliest diseases on the planet--- may soon have a new affordable weapon in their smart phones. Researchers have found a way to use the phone's camera to detect the microorganism in the patient's blood that causes the disease.
According to the World Health Organization, almost 600,000 people died of malaria in 2013, making this mosquito-borne disease one of the deadliest in the world.
The saddest aspect of this calamity  is that it affects mostly young children.
Early detection of the infection is important for successful treatment. But since the first symptoms resemble ordinary flu, a microbiologist must look at a drop of a patient's blood under a microscope for a proper diagnosis.
Scientists in Britain have now developed a smart phone attachment called Xrapid, that turns the phone into a 200-power microscope, while the attached app---based on facial recognition software - quickly detects the parasitic protozoa in the blood smear .
Jean Viry-Babel is the CEO of IanXen, the company that developed the app. He says it is cheap and works on the spot. ""So we take a high-definition picture of a sample of blood. We separate the red blood cells from the rest---the white blood cells, the platelets ---and we start looking at each of the red blood cells individually,"" said Viry-Babel.
Viry-Babel says the app is affordable, easy to use and provides reliability of up to 98 percent. The only additional equipment required is an ordinary glass lab slide - called a ""slate.""
""There's only one button, which is called ""Diagnose"". So you put it on the slate and you put it on the dried blood, and you press diagnose and it tells you yes or no,"" he said.
Researchers say the field-testing of the device will begin in January and February in Tanzania, Benin and Indonesia --- while commercial use is scheduled to start by the end of March.
They also plan to expand the versatility of the new device---teaching it to recognize other diseases, such as tuberculosis and Lyme Disease. 
 Question:What can we learn from Viry-Babel? 
A. The app is cheap but must work in the lab. 
B. The white cells and the platelets must be studied carefully. 
C. The accuracy of the app is nearly a hundred percent. 
D. The ""Diagnose"" button should function well with others.

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. ""

Context: It was something she had dreamed of since she was five. Finally, after years of training and intensive workouts, Deborah Duffey was going to compete in her first high school basketball game. The goals of becoming an outstanding player and playing college ball were never far from Deborah's mind.
The game was against Mills High School. With 1 minute and 42 seconds left in the game, Deborah's team led by one point. A player of Mills had possession of the ball,and Deborah ran to guard against her. As Deborah was running to block the player, her knee went out and she fell down on the court in burning pain. Just like that, Deborah's season was over.
After suffering the bad injury, Deborah found that, for the first time in her life, she was in a situation beyond her control. Game after game, she could do nothing but sit on the sidelines watching others play the game that she loved so much.
Injuries limited Deborah's time on the court as she hurt her knees three more times in the next five years. She had to spend countless hours in a physical clinic to receive treatment. Her frequent visits there gave her a passion and respect for the profession.  And Deborah began to see a new light in her life.
Currently as a senior in college, Deborah focuses on getting a degree in physical treatment. After she graduates, Deborah plans to use her knowledge to educate people how to best take care of their bodies and cope with the feelings of hopelessness that she remembers so well.

Context: My parents have certainly had their troubles, and as their child I'll never know how they made it to 38 years of marriage. They loved each other, but they didn't seem to like each other very much. Dad was too fond of his beer, and he talked down to Mom a lot. When she tried to stand up to him, a fight would unavoidably follow.
It was my dad's disease that began to change things. The year 1998 was the beginning of a remarkable transformation for my family. My father, Jim Dineen, the always healthy, weightlifting, never-missed-a-day-of-work kind of dad, discovered he had kidney  disease.
The decision to go ahead with a transplant for my father was a long and tough one, mostly because he had liver damage too. One physician's assistant told him, ""According to your file, you're supposed to be dead."" And for a while, doctors mistakenly thought that he would need not just a kidney transplant, but a liver transplant too. _ 
When the donor testing process finally began in the spring of 2003, numerous people, including me, my uncle Tom, and my mom, came back as matches of varying degree. But Mom was the one who insisted on going further. She decided to donate a kidney to my father. She said she was not scared, and it was the right thing to do. We all stepped back in amazement.
At last a date was chosen - November 11, 2003. All of a sudden, the only thing that seemed to matter Dad was telling the world what a wonderful thing Mom was doing for him. A month before the surgery, he sent her birthday flowers with a note that read, ""I love you and I love your kidney! Thank you!""
Financially, the disease was upsetting to them. So my sister and I were humbled and surprised when, shortly before his surgery day, Dad handed us a diamond jewelry that we were to give to Mom after the operation. He'd accumulated his spare dollars to buy it.
At the hospital on the day of the transplant, all our relatives and friends gathered in the waiting room and became involved in a mean euchre   tournament. My family has always handled things with a lot of laughter, and even though we were all tense, everybody was taking bets on how long this ""change of conduct"" would last in my parents.
We would inform Dad that if he chose to act like a real pain on any particular day after the operation, he wasn't allowed to blame it on PMS just because he'd now have a female kidney.
The surgeries went well, and not long afterward, my sister and I were allowed to go in to visit. Dad was in a great deal of pain but again, all he could talk about was Mom. Was she okay? How was she feeling? Then the nurses let us do something unconventional. As they were wheeling Mom out of recovery room, they rolled her into a separate position to visit Dad. It was strange to see both my parents hooked up to IVs and machines and trying to talk to each other through tears. The nurses allowed us to present the diamond jewelry to Mom so that Dad could watch her open it. Everyone was crying, even the nurses.
As I stood with digital camera in hand, I tried to keep the presence of mind to document the moment. My dad was having a hard time fighting back emotion, and suddenly my parents unexpectedly reached out to hold each other's hands.
In my nearly 35 years of existence, I'd never seen my parents do that, and I was spellbound. I snapped a picture and later rushed home to make sure I'd captured that enormous, life-defining moment. After so many years of disagreement, it was apparent to me that they finally understood how much each loved the other.

Context: Nuclear power's  danger to health, safety, and even life itself can be described in one word; radiation . Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery about it, partly because it cannot be detected   by human senses. It can't be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around us but we can't detect them, sense them, without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things. At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being completely by killing masses of cells   in important organs  . But even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no level of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be significant. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and if they are killed completely. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They reproduce themselves in an unusual way. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years.
This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the knowledge of the person at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiated  and feel fine, then die of cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. Or a child can be born weak or easy to get serious illness as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents. Radiation can hurt us. We must know the truth. 
 Question:Radiation can hurt us in the way that it can   _  . 
A. kill large numbers of cells in main organs so as to cause death immediately 
B. damage cells which may grow into cancer years later 
C. affect the healthy growth of our younger generation 
D. lead to all of the above results

Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery about it, partly because it cannot be detected by human senses. It can't be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around us but we can't detect them, sense them, without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things. 
At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being immediately by killing masses of cells in vital organs. But even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no levels of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be serious. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and if they are killed immediately. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years.
 This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the victim being aware at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiated and feel fine, then die for cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. Or a child can be born weak as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents.      
 Radiation can hurt us. We must know the truth. 
 Question:What is not the reason why nuclear radiation has a certain mystery? 
A. The hurt cells can stay in the body many years and then grow into cancer. 
B. It can do harm to a person while the victim isn't aware the damage has occurred. 
C. Nuclear radiation can kill a person very easily. 
D. Radiation can seldom kill a person immediately.

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle? 
 Answer: A
Context: _ (from How Do Animals Move?)
Many animals scurry up tree trunks to escape enemies or find food. Some live in the treetops. Many of these animals are not only expert climbers, but they also have found interesting ways to get from tree to tree.
   How Do Animals Adapt?andHow Do Animals Move? are comprehensive explorations of animal adaptations and movement for young readers. Both are part of a 21 book series,The Science of Living Things.
   InHow Do Animals Adapt?readers learn how animals adapt to survive with respect not only to climate, darkness, food and defenses but also to offspring and people. These adaptations are well explained in double page spreads   with examples clearly depicted   in photographs and diagrams and developed through their accompanying captions  .
   As the title suggests, movement is the focus ofHow Do Animals Move?Beginning with a description of the explanation of movement, the reader is exposed to the many different ways of animals movement in the air, on land, under ground and in the water. Several unconventional   variations (e.g. looping of inchworms, the rectilinear motion of snakes) are included. Once again, the photographs and diagrams plainly support the double page spread discussions of animal movement.
   The language of both titles is simple enough for young readers without talking down to them. In both books, terminology   is featured in  . Some of these words are explained in the basic glossary while the majority are explained clearly in the text. Many of these terms provide readers with some fascinating, uncommon words (e.g. brachiation, potassium, skein, and estimate). As do many of Kalman's book, both of these titles have a table of contents, glossary and index   which are all enough to introduce young readers to the nature of these tools.
   Both titles would make excellent additions to any science collection for young readers. 
 Question:What do we know about the two books? 
A. They are in high demand. 
B. They are easy to understand. 
C. They have got confusing titles. 
D. They are good choices for novel-readers.

Context: The World Health Organization reports a number of people have died of the Ebola virus in central  Africa during the last few months. Ebola, also known as Ebola hemorrhagic   fever or Ebola viral disease, is a rare and deadly illness with high death rates in humans and primates. The natural source of Ebola virus remains unknown, although bats seem to be the most likely source.
The Ebola virus began spreading after victims were discovered in northeastern Gabon. So far, it is the third time Ebola has spread through Gabon since 1994. Health officials believe people moving across the border spread the disease from Gabon to Congo. Ebola is highly infectious and kills up to 80% of its victims. Researchers do not know the method with which the virus first appears in humans, but they believe it is through infected animals. The disease then spreads from person to person through blood and other body liquids.
Ebola victims treated early have the base chance of survival. Signs of Ebola include a high temperature, diarrhea, muscle pains and bleeding inside the body, in severe cases, victims experience chest pains and death. There is no known cure for the disease and no way yet to prevent it.
Scientists at the American National institutes of Health are working to develop a vaccine  to prevent Ebola. Doctor Cary Nobel is leading the research effort at N-l-H testing center in the eastern state of Maryland. He says that during the past two years, the vaccine has been tested on small animals and monkeys for safety and effectiveness.
In the most recent study, four monkeys who had been given the vaccine were completely protected from a deadly injection of the Ebola virus. The study was described in November in Nature magazine. Doctor Nobel says the tests appear to have moved scientists one step closer to a vaccine for humans. 
 Question:What can we learn from the passage? 
A. Once infected with the Ebola virus, people can never survive. 
B. Half of the Ebola victims will lose their lives. 
C. No cure has been found for the disease. 
D. Scientists have succeeded in preventing Ebola. 
 Answer: C
Context: The current Ebola   outbreak in western and central Africa has infected at least 3,069 people, including 1,552 dead, making it the largest outbreak in history. Ebola is a deadly virus --about 60 percent of people infected with it have died.
How is Ebola doing its harm?
When a person becomes infected with Ebola, the virus damages the body's immune   cells, which defend against infection, said a researcher at Lancaster University. But if a person's immune system can stand up to this attack, then he is more likely to survive the disease.
The patients that survive it best are those who don't get such a bad disadvantage in immune system. But if the body isn't able to get rid of this attack, then the immune system becomes less able to regulate   itself. This means the immune system is more likely to run out of control, leading to a drop in blood pressure, multi-organ failure and eventually death.
What are the common symptoms of the disease?
Fever. Headache. Joint and muscle aches. Weakness. Diarrhea. Vomiting. Stomach pain. Lack of appetite. Chills. Rash. Redness in the eyes. Hiccups. Cough. Sore throat. Chest pain. Difficult breathing or swallowing. Bleeding inside and outside of the body.
How to prevent the spread of Ebola?
Ebola can be spread primarily via direct contact with patients, specifically the blood and fluids of an infected patient.
We should avoid contact with infected patients and objects such as clothing, bedding, and needles used by them. Avoid areas where infections have been reported. For now, the disease has only been confirmed in central and West Africa, four cases in America and Europe. Avoid eating wild-caught bush meat. Researchers have suspected that the disease came to humans via animals, probably through the meat of primates . If you're in an area where the disease has been reported, avoid purchasing, eating, or handling wild game to stay on the safe side.
Wear protective medical clothing if you're around infected patients. Extreme caution is necessary. Hospital workers must use masks, gloves, goggles, and gowns, which needed to be worn at all times if you're around infected patients.
How Do People Survive Ebola?
Doctors don't know for certain who will survive Ebola, and there is no specific treatment or cure for the disease. Although in the minority, some people do recover from infection.
Our suggestions include:
Maintain your electrolytes   and body liquid. Sports drinks can be used. Monitor your blood pressure and control it if necessary. Dropping blood pressure may be a serious sign of infection. Breathe in an oxygen-rich environment. Quickly address any symptoms of infection. Be honest about when and where you're feeling pain.

Context: As hand-held devices such as smartphones are becoming more common, users are reporting some new physical problems. Florida chiropractor Dean Fishman began noticing an increased number of patients talking about neck and shoulder pain. He discovered these symptoms were due to the overuse of hand-held devices, particularly the action of bending the neck, and then _ the term ""Text Neck."" As if the painful symptoms weren't bad enough, Fishman warns that an untreated case of Text Neck could lead to permanent spinal  damage.
Other doctors have warned about ""iPad Hand,"" a condition that occurs when people use tablets like the iPad for hours at a time. Most people use their left hand to support the tablet and their right hand to tap or scroll. Doing this for long periods without changing positions can result in severe joint pain.
In order to avoid or reduce the possibility of getting Text Neck or iPad Hand, use the following basic ergonomic  principles:
Avoid awkward positioning. Don't strain your neck, and stay aware of how you are positioned in relation to the device. Make sure that both your neck and shoulders are relaxed and that you aren't leaning over for a long period of time.
Take frequent breaks when using any kind of mobile device. Many doctors recommend that users change their position every 15 minutes.
When using a tablet, use a case that can support the device on a table or your lap at a comfortable viewing angle.
Along with a case, use a separate keyboard with your tablet. This will be more comfortable since you'll be resting both hands on the keyboard. And since you won't be holding the tablet, you'll be less likely to experience hand or arm pain. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? 
A. If you are holding an iPad for long periods, it could cause spinal damage. 
B. Text Neck symptoms include long-term damage in the back. 
C. You are advised to lean over in relation to the device. 
D. You should rest your hands on the keyboard at times. 
 Answer: B
Context: CANBERRA (Reuters Life!) - Think twice before eating those dropped crumbs off your computer keyboard -- you might as well be eating off a toilet seat, according to a new study on the amount of germs on keyboards.
A study by British ""Which? Computing"" asked a microbiologist to examine for bugs on 33 keyboards in a typical London office, a toilet seat and a toilet door handle.
Four keyboards were judged potential health hazards and the microbiologist recommended the removal of one keyboard as it had 150 times the pass limit of bacteria -- five times filthier than the swabbed toilet seat.
""Most people don't give much thought to the grime that builds up on their PC, but if you don't clean your computer, you might as well eat your lunch off the toilet,"" said Sarah Kidner, the consumer magazine editor of ""Which? Computing"" in a statement.
The study found that eating lunch at desks is the main cause of a bug-infested keyboard. Dropped crumbs and food encourages the growth of millions of bacteria.
Poor personal hygiene, such as not washing hands after going to the toilet, may also add to the dirtiness of keyboards.
But despite the health hazard of a dirty keyboard, a survey of 4,000 people by the magazine found one in 10 people ever cleaned their keyboard while another two in 10 never cleaned their mouse.
Almost half -- or 46 per cent -- cleaned their keyboard less than once a month.
To clear out bugs, the magazine recommends users unplug keyboards, turn them upside down and shake them. 
 Question:What do you think the expression ""Think twice before eating those dropped crumbs off your computer keyboard"" stands for? 
A. Think several times before eating beside your computer 
B. Don't drop foods onto the computer keyboard. 
C. Don't eat foods dropped onto the computer keyboard. 
D. Be careful when you are eating by the computer.

Context: Recently hand-foot-mouth disease has spread across China. In the past three months, there have been about 41,846 cases   in 30 provinces and regions. The number is increasing. Eighteen Chinese children have died of the disease so far this year.
What causes the disease and why is it dangerous?
Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common childhood illness. It mainly affects children under the age of 10. It gets its name from the rash   that develops on the hands and feet. It can also cause blisters   in your mouth.
A child who has the disease will usually have a fever, a runny nose and sore throat. He or she doesn't want to eat or drink because of pain in the mouth.
Hand-foot-mouth disease is mostly not serious. The fever and rash clear within a few days. But in some cases, the virus   affects the heart, lungs or brain. This puts the child's life in danger.
A virus causes hand-foot-mouth disease. The disease spreads easily where a lot of young children are together, such as in a child-care center. Sometimes it can also affect teenagers and adults.
In order not to pass on the virus, good hygiene   is important. We should wash our hands as often as possible. Especially we should wash our hands before meals and after going to the toilet. 
 Question:_   can help us to keep away from the hand-foot-mouth disease. 
A. Passing on the virus 
B. Taking children to the child-care center 
C. Keeping your hands clean 
D. Not going to public places

 Answer: B
Context: Nearly everyone agrees that money doesn't buy as much as it used to, no matter when you want to spend it. This is certainly true of the paper money that passes so quickly through one's hands. But what about coins that seem to do very little except stay in purses and pockets? Unlike notes, metal money becomes more valuable the longer it is held, especially if it is put away where it won't get scratched or worn. Why is this? One reason is that coins, being more durable, fall more readily into a category for collectors. Naturally, the rarer gold pieces must become more valuable as the price of this metal goes up.
But, curiously, one of the rarest coins in the world is not made of gold, but of the relatively cheaper silver. In 1840, the United States mint   struck 19570 silver dollars. That is what its records show. Today only six of this original number remain and these are unlikely ever to reach the auction   market. So what happened to some 19564 large silver coins, not the easiest sort of things to lose? One of the more romantic theories is that they were part of the payment to Napoleon for the American land then known as Louisiana. But they never reached France. Somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico, the ship transporting them was sunk, either by a storm or by pirates. The probable answer to the mystery is that they were melted down -- since the silver value was greater than the actual value of the coin. What really happened to the rest will probably always remain a mystery. What is known is that whoever can come up with one will find himself instantly rich. 
 Question:Coins become more valuable because   _  . 
A. they stay in purses and pockets 
B. the price of metal goes up 
C. they fall more readily into a category for collectors due to their duration 
D. Both B and C

Context: The World Health Organization (WHO) planned to study the relationship between the eating habits of the people and the disease. Two doctors were chosen to make the study. They flew to Africa south of the Sahara and during the next two months visited ten countries. They found that serious diseases of poor eating, often mistaken for other diseases, existed in all parts of Africa. The diseases were similar and could therefore all be named kwashiorkor. The diseased children are usually from one to four years old. As the illness progresses, the child's stomach becomes swollen by liquid collecting in the body. The skin changes color and may break out in open sores . The hair changes color and starts to fall out. The patient loses all interest in his surroundings and even in food, and becomes so weak that he wants to lie down all the time. Stomach liquids are no longer produced.
The doctors reasoned that kwashiorkor was found in the young children of this age in many parts of Africa because of lack of milk or meat. Their mothers, after stopping their breastfeeding, gave them foods full of starches instead of greatly needed proteins. They found that the addition of milk to the food of the children suffering from kwashiorkor saved many lives.
The unbelievable thing about kwashiorkor is that the very existence of the disease--which has been killing thousands of children for centuries--was not even recognized in Latin America as recently as ten years ago. The deaths of those children were mistakenly listed as due to other diseases. It was the WHO's work in Africa that led to the discovery of the problem in Central America. 
 Question:It is difficult to discover kwashiorkor because   _   . 
A. it has no symptoms at all 
B. it is hard to identify signs of it 
C. it doesn't last long enough for careful observation 
D. it is hardly different from other diseases 
 Answer: D

Context: In the book The Best Little Girl in the World, Kessa has a serious eating disorder   called anorexia nervosa. But she is not alone. Many people have this eating disorder.
In the beginning of her story, Kessa is a normal 15-year-old. She is good at many things, especially dancing. She has danced for many years and loves it. One day her dance teacher tells her to continue eating right, but maybe lose a few pounds. Once Kessa hears this, she takes things too far. Instead of cutting down on snacks and junk food, she decides not to eat at all. She does not eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner. She begins losing weight and becomes slimmer   and slimmer. But she loses weight to a point where she is unhealthy.
As her poor eating habits continue, her parents start getting as much help as possible to cure   their beautiful daughter. But it is just as hard for Kessa's parents to deal with her disorder as it is for her. Everyday she exercises to lose more pounds and plans what and when she will eat. Her parents try everything, but Kessa decides not to have any fat on her body.
Kessa's doctor and parents finally take her to the hospital. She is now so thin that she can hardly walk. There, she is given good care.
In the rest of the book, Kessa goes through a lot of trouble in order to cure her eating disorder. This book, I think, can help to prevent people from doing this to themselves. It shows the trouble that people go through just to be slimmer, and all the terrible things they must experience to be cured. It is a book I think every teenager should read.

Context: When Jason's parents saw him for the first time, they were shocked .This lovely little baby with shining blue eyes and curly hair was born disabled . But soon the young couple accepted this fact: Jason's arms are just half without hands and his legs aren't fully grown either. They even forgot to think of him as disabled.
At the age of six, he told his mother he wanted to get down from the prosthetics and play with other kids. This was the last time Jason had worn them. He now has an electric wheelchair , but he never uses it at home or when it is easy for him to move using only his body.
Jason learned handwriting and coloring at school, holding the pen between the ends of his arms. He also learned to eat with forks at home. When he was ten, he fell in love with football. He never had a pair of shoes in his life because of the shape of his feet. He only wore socks on the football field. He never won a match, but he refused to give up. His strong arms and body, as well as some fantastic ways made him a respected player on the school team. He went to a famous university after high school.
Now Jason still faces many _ in life, but he will make you believe that you can do what he has done. ""Never be afraid of any difficulty"", Jason often encourages others in his speeches.

A. Disabled but still able 
B. Playing football brings good luck 
C. Never wear prosthetics even disabled 
D. Walking hard at school and home

Context: Nowadays with the development of agriculture, farmers use more technology. However, they are being told more needs to be done to stop them injuring at work. One in five British workplace deaths happens in agriculture even though farmers are only a small part of the working population. During the year 2012/13 there were 1,061 injuries in total and it is thought many more go unreported.
Jim Chapman from Warwickshire had his arm torn off by farm machinery seven years ago when he was 23. ""You don't realize how much you rely on your second arm until it's gone,"" he said. He fell against a PTO shaft  , a spinning metal bar at the back of a tractor. ""It catapulted   me from one side of the machine to the other,"" he said. ""I landed on the floor, minus all my clothing. My left arm had been torn off."" He admits that the machinery was missing part of its proper safety guard. ""But again,"" he added, ""it was a rushed day. There were a few machines that didn't work. Also, I was getting behind with the jobs.""
Over the last 10 years, other industries that you'd think of as dangerous, like building or quarrying  , have lowered the number of workplace deaths and injures. In the farming industry though, deaths remain high with 34 deaths in 2012/13. 
Judith Hackett, the chair of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says it is ""not acceptable"" that the accident statistics for farming are still high. ""People in farming don't have minor   injuries. When they get injured, it's bad."" She said. ""When I said to the National Farmers' Union (NFU) that if I had sons I would not want them to work in agriculture, it really made them sit up and take notice."" There's a whole host of reasons why farming is as dangerous as it is. It is a very rough industry. Also, it's often because people are left alone. They could be young and inexperienced, or older people, who would have retired maybe 5 or 10 years ago in other industries.
Jim wants others to learn from his experience. ""Look at what you're doing before you go running in,"" he said. ""You could make a mistake that you'll live with for the rest of your life."" 
 Question:What happened to Jim Chapman when he was 23? 
A. He lost his job. 
B. He lost one of his arms. 
C. He lost both of his arms. 
D. His farm machine broke down. 
 Answer: B
Context: Hospital emergency rooms treat injured fingers all the time. Without treatment, a bad cut can lead to permanent damage. But how should a person know when a bleeding cut is serious enough to require medical attention? We asked Dr Martin Brown, chairman of the department of emergency medicine at Inova Alexandria Hospital in Virginia.
First, the medical term for a cut or tear in the skin is a laceration(,). Dr Brown says the length is usually not as important as the depth. He says a long cut on a finger can likely be treated without a visit to a doctor if the wound is not very deep. ""If you have a short but deep laceration where there's been a structure underneath that's been damaged - a tendon, a nerve, a blood vessel,"" says Martin, ""it may, in fact, need professional attention.""
Some injuries - like a fingertip that gets cut off - might even require surgery to repair. That requires a specialist to either file  down the bone or _ the fingertip. More often, filing down the bone is what is done because reattaching a fingertip is often not successful.
How a wound bleeds can be a sign of how serious it is. Minor cuts usually produce what is known as venous   bleeding. This means the blood flows steadily from the injury. The bleeding will often stop when pressure is put on the wound. Dr Brown says in most cases holding direct pressure with clean gauze or a cloth for four to five minutes should stop the bleeding. With a cut finger, holding the hand above the heart can reduce the loss of blood. But if a cut appears to be pumping blood out with some force, this may be a sign of arterial  bleeding. This kind of injury should be treated by a medical professional as soon as possible.
Even a cut that does not require medical attention must be kept clean to prevent infection. Small cuts should be cleaned gently with clean water. Use a washcloth to clean the area if the wound is dirty. Dr Brown says cuts should be covered with a clean, dry bandage. 
 Question:.The best title of this passage should be  _  . 
A. Hospital Emergency Treatments For Injured Fingers 
B. When a Cut Finger Is More Serious Than It Might Seem 
C. Serious Finger Cut That Requires Medical Attention 
D. Keep Finger Cuts Clean to Prevent Serious Infection 
 Answer: B
Context: On Nov.18,1995,Itzhak Perlman,the violinist,came on stage to give a concert at Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center in New York City.
If you have ever been to a Perlman concert, _ him.He was stricken with polio as a child,and so he has braces on both legs and walks with the aid of two crutches .
He walks painfully, yet majestically, until he reaches his chair.Then he sits down,slowly, puts his crutches on the floor, undoes the clasps on his legs,tucks one foot back and extends the other foot forward.Then he bends down and picks up the violin, puts it under his chin,nods to the conductor and proceeds to play.
But this time,something went wrong.Just as he fmished the first few bars ,one of the strings on his violin broke.You could hear it snap ---it went off like gunfire across the room.There was no mistaking what that meant.There was no mistaking what he had to do.
We figured that he would have to get up,put on the clasps again,pick up the crutches and limp his way off stage-to either find another violin or else find another string for this one.But he didn't.Instead.he waited a moment,closed his eyes and then signaled the conductor to begin again.
The orchestra began,and he played from where he had left off.And he played with such passion and such power and such purity as they had never heard before.
When he finished, there was an awesome silence in the room.And then people rose and cheered.He smiled,wiped the sweat from this brow, raised his bow to quit us,and then he said in a quiet tone.""You know, sometimes it is the artist's task to find out how much music you can still make with what you have left.'' 
 Question:When one of the strings broke,people thought Itzhak Perlman would  _  . 
A. go on playing with the remaining three strings 
B. give up playing 
C. change or repair his violin 
D. get off the stage with shame

Context: Book into the new prefix = st1 /AucklandHospitalat a typical hour, say 11 on a Saturday night, and you will notice changes in the way you are treated.
Let's start with the blood sample taken from your arm as you are wheeled in the door. 
By the time you are through the security doors and into the emergency area, that sample could have been sent through to the lab by vacuum tube and analysed by a machine which automatically feeds a preparative result into the clinical database. 
Less than a minute after the sample is processed, the doctors can see the results through the monitors beside every position in the emergency suites. 
As you are being wheeled in, you may notice cameras in the ceiling. The hospital has spent $4 million on its camera security system to protect staff and patients. 
When you come to in the neighbouring Admission and Planning Unit, the clinician  may be looking at all your records, x-rays and even documents sent in by your GP on a Compaq tablet PC wirelessly connected to the network by an 802.11 ""WiFi"" card. 
It's not ideal for viewing images, but it should be good enough for a bedside consultation . 
If the clinician needs to consult a specialist or your GP, the other party can see the same records from home or office through a secure internet connection. 
Dr Nigel Murray, general manager of the hospital building programme, said about $30 million of the $500 million budget for the project had been spent on information technology.

D. Doctors in this hospital also use computer and the network to look at your case history. 
 Answer: C
Context: People who are worried about bad breath often reach for a toothbrush or a gun. But in the future, personal breath monitoring may include far more than fresh breath.
In face, breath is so rich in chemical compounds that fully understanding it has proved challenging. Each breath contains gases like carbon dioxide, the volatile remains of recent snacks, medicines and even compounds taken in from things like carpeting or various kinds of air pollution. But breath detectors  can sort out these substances with increasing sensitivity . 
Scientists are building electronic sniffers that examine the exhaled air for signs of cancer, asthma , and other diseases.
""There are clear signatures in the breath for liver disease, kidney disease and heart disease. Breath is a rich mixture that can reflect out state of health and disease."" said Dr. Raed Dweik, director of the Cleveland Clinic, adding ""Breath analysis is the future of medical testing.""
He and his partners are testing a desktop system called BreathLink for use in rapid identification of diseases. The system is designed to work wherever there is an Internet connection. To use BreathLink, a person breathes into a long tube, and a breath sample is collected and analyzed within the system. Then it can detail chemical concentrations of the breath in graphics. Dr. Raed Dweik said, ""If you examine patients of asthma, you will find they have higher levels of nitric oxide  in their exhaled air. It reflects their abnormal symptoms in the lungs."" His tests have reached 85 percent accuracy so far in spotting people with some illness.
But some trained dogs, he pointed out, can sniff out cancer with 99 percent accuracy--although without the ability to identify particular compounds the way some detectors can.
""We are getting better and better,"" he said. ""But whether we will ever approach the accuracy of the dog--we don't know."" 
 Question:It can be inferred that  _ 
A. brushing teeth can improve one's bad breath 
B. there are leftovers like snacks and medicines in one's breath 
C. one can know exactly about his physical state through the breath 
D. breath analysis can be helpful in medical diagnosis 
 Answer: D
Context: Every year, World Blood Day is celebrated by blood services worldwide on 14 June, the birthday of Nobel Prize winner Karl Landsteiner, the man who discovered the ABO blood group system. If you have every thought of becoming a blood donor, just register to do it. And you should never worry about the donation.
Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body.
It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients.
First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday.
Although most people are able to give blood, some people who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease are no tasked to be donors. Pregnant women or those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood.
Blood has a very short shelf life. Some blood components can be kept longer than others, for instance red blood cells will keep for 35 days but platelets for only five. Remember, you should wait at least 16 weeks before donating blood again. 
 Question:What component of blood is used to treat burned patients? 
A. Plasma 
B. Red blood cell 
C. Antibody 
D. White blood cell 
 Answer: A
Context: Every year, World Blood Day is celebrated by blood services worldwide on 14 June, the birthday of Nobel Prize winner Karl Landsteiner, the man who discovered the ABO blood group system. If you have every thought of becoming a blood donor, just register to do it. And you should never worry about the donation.
Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body.
It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients.
First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday.

Context: Since ancient times, people have known about its ability to reduce pain and high body temperature. More than 2000 years ago, the Greek doctor Hippocrates advised his patients to chew on the bark and leaves of the willow.
The tree contains a chemical called salicin . From salicin, researchers in the 1800s discovered how to make salicylic acid . And in 1897, a chemist named Felix Hoffmann at Friedrich Bayer and Company in Germany created acetyl salicylic acid. Later it became the active substance in a new medicine that Bayer called aspirin. The ""a"" came from acetyl. The ""spir"" came from the spirea plant, which also produces salicin. And the ""in"" Well, that is a common way to end medicine names.
In 1982, a British scientist shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in part for discovering how aspirin works. Sir John Vane found that aspirin blocks the body from making natural substances called prostaglandins .Prostaglandins have several effects on the body. Some cause pain and the expansion, or swelling( ; ), of damaged tissue. Others protect the lining of the stomach and small intestine. Prostaglandins also make the heart, kidneys and blood vessels  work well. But there is a problem. Aspirin works against all prostaglandins, good and bad. Scientists learned how aspirin interferes with an enzyme . One form of this enzyme makes the prostaglandin that causes pain and swelling. Another form of the enzyme creates a protective effect. So aspirin can reduce pain and swelling in damaged tissues. But it can also harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine . 
 Question:What can we know about aspirin according to the passage? 
A. Aspirin can treat almost diseases. 
B. Aspirin can create the protective enzyme. 
C. Aspirin can harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
D. Aspirin can protect the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
 Answer: C

Context: One Monday morning, Paul and his classmates were in science laboratory for their practical chemistry lesson. The students were going to work in pairs to do an experiment. Before they began, the teacher gave them this description of the different stages of the experiment.
Stage 1: Prepare the equipment: a test tube, a crucible, a Bunsen burner and tongs.
Stage 2: Weigh 5 grams of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and put it in a crucible.
Stage 3: Heat 10 ml of hydrochloric acid   in a test tube.
Stage 4: Pour the warm acid onto the baking soda and continue to heat the mixture.
Result: The acid reacts with the bicarbonate to form water, carbon dioxide gas and salt. The hotter the mixture, the quicker the reaction. Continue to heat the mixture until the water evaporates, leaving the salt in the crucible.
Paul and his partner followed the instructions and set up their equipment. Paul went to the cupboard to get a bottle of hydrochloric acid. He found that there was only one bottle in the cupboard so he took that. There was no label on the bottle and Paul didn't check with the teacher if it was the right solution.
He measured the liquid and poured it into a test tube. Using tongs to hold the test tube, he heated it over the Bunsen burner. That's when things started to go wrong. The liquid in the test tube was not hydrochloric acid. When it was heated, it formed a thick cloud of white gas. Soon the room was full of this strong smelling white gas.
All the students started coughing and their eyes hurt. The teacher immediately opened the windows and ordered the students to leave the laboratory at once. She realized that the liquid was a crylamide   and that it is poisonous.
Fortunately, nobody was injured in the incident. However, it taught the students and the teacher a good lesson. 
 Question:What substance were the students making in the experiment? 
A. Water 
B. Carbon dioxide gas 
C. Salt 
D. Poisonous gas

Context: A Concussion  happens when the brain is shaken, often in a car crash or a fall or a strike on; the head in sports.Concussions can be mild, but doctors may order a CT scan to look for a more serious injury.But a recent study warned that more children than necessary are being exposed  to radiation this way.
A national team led by two doctors at the University of California, Davis, studied hospital records from thousands of children with head injuries. They found that in many cases, the risk of developing cancer from the radiation outweighed the risk of a serious brain injury.
The study found that one in five children over age two had a low risk of serious injury but received CT scans anyway. The same was true of almost one in four children under two years of age.
The researchers have developed rules to predict if a head injury is serious enough for a scan. For children under two, doctors are advised against it if there is:
*Normal mental activity.
*No swelling in the back of the head.
*No feeling of a broken bone in the skull.  
*And no loss of consciousness for more than five seconds.
Doctors should also consider how the child was injured and whether the parents say the child is acting normally.
For patients from two to eighteen, the guidelines are similar ---- except there should be no l vomiting and no severe headache.
Earlier this year, the British Journal of Sports Medicine published new guidelines for concussions in children and teens. International experts said they should not return to sports or school until fully recovered. The brain also needs a ""cognitive rest,"" they say, by restricting activities like video games, texting and watching TV.
It often take longer than adults to recover from a concussion than adults. The experts say individual progress and not a set time period should always guide a decision to return to play.

Context: At age 61, identical twins Jeanne and Susan no longer look exactly alike. Susan smoked for many years and is an admitted sun worshipper, whose habits Jeanne does not share. A new study of twins suggests you can blame those coarse wrinkles, brown or pink spots on too much time in the sun, smoking, and being overweight.
Because twins share genes, but may have different exposures to environmental factors, studying twins allows an ""opportunity to control for genetic susceptibility ,"" Dr. Elma D. Baron, at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio, and his colleagues explain in the latest issue of Archives of Dermatology.
Their analysis of environmental skin-damaging factors in 65 pairs of twins hints that skin aging is related more to environment and lifestyle than genetic factors.
But when it comes to skin cancer, the researchers say their findings support previous reports that both environment and genes affect skin cancer risk.
Baron's team examined facial skin of 130 twins, 18 to 77 years old, who lived mostly in the northem Midwest and Eastern regions of the US, who were attending the Twins Days Festival in Ohio in August 2002. At this time, each of the twins also separately reported how their skin burned or tanned without sunscreen, their weight, and their history of skin cancer, smoking, and alcohol drinking. The study group consisted of 52 fraternal and 10 identical twin pairs, plus 3 pairs who were unsure of their twin status.
From these data, the researchers noted strong ties, outside of twin status, between smoking, older age, and being overweight, and having facial skin with evidence of environmental damage. By contrast, sunscreen use and drinking alcohol appeared related to less skin damage.
Baron and his colleagues say the current findings, which highlight ties between facial aging and potentially avoidable environmental factors--such as smoking, being overweight, and unprotected overexposure to the sun's damaging rays--may help motivate people to minimize these risky behaviors. 
 Question:Why did Baron's team do the research on twins? 
A. Twins are more likely to suffer from skin cancer. 
B. It may guarantee the research is not influenced by genetic factors. 
C. It gives others an opportunity to control twins' genes. 
D. It helps find twins are exposed to different environments. 
 Answer: B
Context: Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery, partly because it cannot be detected  by human senses. It can't be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around but we can't detect them or sense them without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things.
At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being outright by killing masses of cells in important organs. Even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no level of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be serious. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and when they are killed outright. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They reproduce themselves in an unusual way. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years.
This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the knowledge of the person at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiated and feel fine, then die of cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. A child can be born weak or easy to get serious illness as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents. 
 Question:Radiation can lead to serious trouble even at the lowest level   _  .

Context: Nuclear power's danger to health, safety, and even life itself can be summed up in one word: radiation.
Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery about it, partly because it cannot be detected by human senses. It can't be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around us but we can't detect them, sense them, without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things. 
At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being immediately by killing masses of cells in vital organs. But even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no levels of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be serious. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and if they are killed immediately. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years.
 This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the victim being aware at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiated and feel fine, then die for cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. Or a child can be born weak as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents.      
 Radiation can hurt us. We must know the truth. 
 Question:What is not the reason why nuclear radiation has a certain mystery? 
A. The hurt cells can stay in the body many years and then grow into cancer. 
B. It can do harm to a person while the victim isn't aware the damage has occurred. 
C. Nuclear radiation can kill a person very easily. 
D. Radiation can seldom kill a person immediately.

Context: In the rush to get to school, you drop a piece of toast on the floor. Do you throw it away or dec ide it' s still OK to eat? If you're like most people, you eat it. Maybe you follow the ""5-second rule"", which claims foods are safe to eat if you pick them up within 5 seconds after dropping them. But you might want to think again. Scientists now say that 5 seconds is all it takes for foods to become polluted with enough bacteria  to make you sick.
Bacteria can cause many kinds of illnesses. Some kinds of bacteria can grow on food. If you eat foods on which these bacteria are growing, you can become sick.
One of these food-borne bacteria is Salmonella. It makes 1.4 million people sick every year. Salmonella is often found in raw eggs and chicken. Cooking kills these bacteria, which is why it is so important to cook eggs, chicken, and other foods thoroughly.
But how long does it take these bacteria to pollute food? A team of scientists in South Carolina did an experiment. First, they placed an amount of Salmonella on three surfaces; wood, tile  , and carpet. They placed a piece of bread and a piece of bologna  on each surface for 5,30, or 60 seconds. After just 5 seconds, both the bread and the bologna picked up enough bacteria to make you sick.
So forget the 5-second rule. If your toast drops on the floor, throw it away and get another piece of clean toast. This time, be careful not to drop it! 
 Question:The scientists in South Carolina did the experiment to 
A. see how quickly bacteria can pollute food 
B. show that the 5-second rule a correct 
C. see how harmful bacteria are to people' health 
D. show that bacteria grow at different speeds on different foods 
 Answer: A
Context: Health experts have long worried about the increasing rate of obesity in kids. It's an important concern: Being weight or obese during childhood can lead to serious problems normally seen in adults, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Poor diets and a lack of exercise are usually the causes. But would you ever have imagined there might be a connection between the bacteria that lived in your guts  when you were a baby and the chance that you would become overweight?
Scientists in Finland recently found just such a link. In a recent study, they showed that overweight kids had different species of bacteria living in their guts.
You probably think of bacteria only as germs that can make you sick. While it's true that some bacteria can make people ill, your body actually depends on some types of bacteria to help you digest food and extract nutrients from it. These ""good"" bacteria live in your guts, where they process the food you eat.
Human babies get these bacterial helpers from their moms. When a baby is born, some of the bacteria in the mother move into the baby's body. Growing babies get additional ""good"" bacteria from the milk their mothers produce. And it turns out the bacteria might play an important role in regulating weight just six years later.
So how could these bacteria affect weight? The researchers still haven't tested that question, but future tests might lead to an answer. 
 Question:The purpose of writing this passage is to   _  . 
A. introduce the role of bacteria in children's weight 
B. analyze the influence of obesity on kids 
C. give advice on how to lose weight quickly 
D. explain the function of bacteria in foods 
 Answer: A
Context: Doctors in hospital emergency rooms often see accidental poisonings . A frightened parent arrives with a child who swallowed a cleaning liquid. Or perhaps the harmful substance is a medicine. Or it might be a chemical product meant to kill insects. These are common causes of accidental poisoning.
In cases like this, look for medical help as soon as possible. Save the container of whatever caused the poisoning. And look on the container for information about anything that stops the effects of the poison. Save anything expelled   from the mouth of the victim. That way, doctors can examine it.
In the past, some people forced poisoning victims to empty the stomach. They used a liquid syrup of ipecac   to do this. But an organization of children's doctors no longer advises parents to keep syrup of ipecac. The American Academy of Pediatrics says some poisons can cause additional damage when they come back up the throat.
Millions of people know a way to save a person who is choking on something trapped in the throat. The method is commonly known as the Heimlich Maneuver or abdominal thrusts. The American Red Cross says a rescuer should first hit the person on the back five times between the shoulder bones. These back blows may ease the choking. If the airway is still blocked, the Red Cross suggests pushing hard five times along the victim's abdomen. The abdomen is the area between the chest and the hip   bones. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the text? 
A. Learning the basics of first aid

Context: CANBERRA (Reuters Life!) - Think twice before eating those dropped crumbs off your computer keyboard -- you might as well be eating off a toilet seat, according to a new study on the amount of germs on keyboards.
A study by British ""Which? Computing"" asked a microbiologist to examine for bugs on 33 keyboards in a typical London office, a toilet seat and a toilet door handle.
Four keyboards were judged potential health hazards and the microbiologist recommended the removal of one keyboard as it had 150 times the pass limit of bacteria -- five times filthier than the swabbed toilet seat.
""Most people don't give much thought to the grime that builds up on their PC, but if you don't clean your computer, you might as well eat your lunch off the toilet,"" said Sarah Kidner, the consumer magazine editor of ""Which? Computing"" in a statement.
The study found that eating lunch at desks is the main cause of a bug-infested keyboard. Dropped crumbs and food encourages the growth of millions of bacteria.
Poor personal hygiene, such as not washing hands after going to the toilet, may also add to the dirtiness of keyboards.
But despite the health hazard of a dirty keyboard, a survey of 4,000 people by the magazine found one in 10 people ever cleaned their keyboard while another two in 10 never cleaned their mouse.
Almost half -- or 46 per cent -- cleaned their keyboard less than once a month.
To clear out bugs, the magazine recommends users unplug keyboards, turn them upside down and shake them. 
 Question:What do you think the expression ""Think twice before eating those dropped crumbs off your computer keyboard"" stands for? 
A. Think several times before eating beside your computer 
B. Don't drop foods onto the computer keyboard. 
C. Don't eat foods dropped onto the computer keyboard. 
D. Be careful when you are eating by the computer.

Context: The morning had been a disaster. My tooth was aching,and I'd been in an argument with a friend. Her words still hurt:""The trouble with you is that you won't put yourself in my place. Can't you see things from my point of view?""I shook my head stubbornly-and felt the ache in my tooth. I'd thought I could hold out till my dentist came back from holiday,but the pain was really unbearable. I started calling the dentists in the phone book,but no one could see me immediately.

Context: In some parts of the United States, farming is easy. But farming has always been difficult in the northeastern corner of the country, which is called New England.
    New England has many trees and thin, rocky soil. Anyone who has wanted to start a new farm there has had to work very hard. The first job has been cutting down trees. The next job has been digging the stumps of the trees out of the soil. Then the farmer has had the difficult job of removing stones from his land.
    This work of removing stones never really ends, because every winter more stones appear. They come up through the thin soil from the rocks below. Farmers have to keep removing stones from the fields. Even today, farms which have been worked on for 200 years keep producing more stones.
    That is why stone walls are used instead of fences around New England fields. The stone walls are not high; a man can easily climb over them. But they keep the farmer's cows from joining his neighbor's cows. 
 Question:In New England, stone walls are used   _  . 
A. to protect the farmer's fields from thieves 
B. to keep the farmer's cattle from wandering away 
C. to provide privacy for the farmer's family 
D. to prevent the wind from blowing away the earth

Context: After years of hearing drivers complain about scratches on their cars, Japan's Nissan Motor Company has officially announced the next big thing---a paint that not only resists scratches and scrapes, but actually repairs itself within a few days.
The new material, developed by Nippon Paint Company, contains an elastic rubbery-like resin  that is able to heal minor marks caused by car wash equipment, parking lot encounters, road debris   or even on-purpose destruction. The automaker admits its results vary depending on the temperature and the depth of the damage, but adds this is the only paint like it in the world, and tests prove it works. Minor scratches, the most common type, are said to slowly fade over about a week. And once they're gone, there is no trace that they were ever there. The special paint is said to last for at least three years after it is first applied, but there is no word yet on whether more can be added after that period.
Nissan claims car washes are the worst offenders for this type of damage, accounting for at least 80 percent of all incidents. But the complete auto-healing won't come without scratching your wallet. The vehicle maker notes the special paint adds about $ 100 U.S. to the price of a car. It plans to use its new chemical mixture only on its X - Trail SUVs in Japan for now, as it looks for a more widespread presentation. And while plans to offer the feature overseas haven't been made yet, if it's a hit there, you can be almost sure market forces will drive it to these shores, as well. 
 Question:The paint used on cars can  _  . 
A. last 3 years before it is re-applied again 
B. fade only in a few days 
C. help to protect cars from minor paint damage 
D. reduce car scrape incidents to 20 percent 
 Answer: C
Context: Some people like modern art, while others say that is rubbish. But a cleaner who works in the Tate Gallery in London isn't able to tell the difference. The woman, whose name isn't known, mistook a work of art by the German painter Gustav Metzger for a bag of rubbish, and threw it out with other bags. The plastic bad, which contained pieces of paper and cardboard, was later recovered outside the gallery, but the artist thought that it was too damaged to be put on show again. 78-year-old Mr Metzger explained that the exhibit, which he said was a copy of a similar work he had created in 1960, was meant to show that all art is temporary and ""finite"" .
Embarrassed officials at the museum said that they had had to call a meeting with cleaners to explain which things should not be touched. They would not say whether Mr Metzger would be paid any compensation for the incident. However, to make absolutely sure the same thing would not happen again, they decided to cover Mr Metzger's work every evening with a colored cloth. In this way the cleaners arriving after the gallery had closed to the general public would realize they should not touch it.
This is not the first time that museum cleaners have had trouble distinguishing exhibits from rubbish. In 2001, in another London gallery, a cleaner threw away a work by the well-known British artist Damien Hirst. It was an arrangement  of empty beer bottles, coffee cups, and overflowing ashtrays, which were meant to indicate the chaos in the life of an artist.
However, cleaners don't always throw things away--sometimes they clean them! This was the case with a dirty asking what the bath was doing in the gallery, the cleaners simply scrubbed it clean. 
 Question:What's the best title of the passage? 
A. Cleaners mistake modern art for rubbish 
B. Modern art shouldn't be cleaned 
C. What makes a great work of art 
D. Cleaners don't always throw things away

Context: Plants need green leaves to make food. A plant needs sunlight and carbon dioxide  from the air for making food and it also needs water and salts from the soil to make food too. There are certain cells   in the leaves which change carbon dioxide and water into sugar. To do this the cells needs energy, which they get from the sunlight.
Green leaves make food for the whole plant. A red leaf can make food too because under the red color1ing of the leaf there are food----making cells. There are no leaves which are completely yellow, for they can't make food.
The plant makes sugar for its food. In sunlight green leaves make a lot of sugar. The veins   can't carry all this sugar away, so the leaves change the sugar into starch  , which is kept and so stored in the leaves. At night, the starch changes back to sugar. It is then carried away from the leaves. Some of the sugar is used as food by the plant while the rest is stored as starch. In some plants, food is stored in the roots, in others it is stored in the stem   and in leaves, fruits and seeds. 
 Question:Sugar is made for its food by   _  . 
A. sunlight 
B. veins 
C. stems 
D. green leaves

Context: Malaria, the world's most widespread parasitic  disease, kills as many as three million people every year--almost all of whom are under five, very poor, and African. In most years, more than five hundred million cases of illness result from the disease, although exact numbers are difficult to assess because many people don't (or can't) seek care. It is not unusual for a family earning less than two hundred dollars a year to spend a quarter of its income on malaria treatment, and what they often get no longer works. In countries like Tanzania, Mozambique, and the Gambia, no family, village, hospital, or workplace can remain unaffected for long.
Malaria starts suddenly, with violent chills, which are soon followed by an intense fever and, often, headaches. As the parasites multiply, they take over the entire body. Malaria parasites live by eating the red blood cells they infect. They can also attach themselves to blood vessels in the brain. If it doesn't kill you, malaria can happen again and again for years. The disease passed on to humans by female mosquitoes infected with one of four species of parasite. Together, the mosquito and the parasite are the most deadly couple in the history of the earth--and one of the most successful. Malaria has five thousand genes, and its ability to change rapidly to defend itself and resist new drugs has made it nearly impossible to control. Studies show that mosquitoes are passing on the virus more frequently, and there are more outbreaks in cities with large populations. Some of the disease's spread is due to global warming.
For decades, the first-choice treatment for malaria parasites in Africa has been chloroquine, a chemical which is very cheap and easy to make. Unfortunately, in most parts of the world, malaria parasites have become resistant to it. Successful alternatives that help prevent resistance are already available, but they have been in short supply and are very expensive. If these drugs should fail, nobody knows what would come next.

D. nobody knows what will be the drug to treat the disease 
 Answer: B
Context: Doctors fighting malaria---one of the deadliest diseases on the planet--- may soon have a new affordable weapon in their smart phones. Researchers have found a way to use the phone's camera to detect the microorganism in the patient's blood that causes the disease.
According to the World Health Organization, almost 600,000 people died of malaria in 2013, making this mosquito-borne disease one of the deadliest in the world.
The saddest aspect of this calamity  is that it affects mostly young children.
Early detection of the infection is important for successful treatment. But since the first symptoms resemble ordinary flu, a microbiologist must look at a drop of a patient's blood under a microscope for a proper diagnosis.
Scientists in Britain have now developed a smart phone attachment called Xrapid, that turns the phone into a 200-power microscope, while the attached app---based on facial recognition software - quickly detects the parasitic protozoa in the blood smear .
Jean Viry-Babel is the CEO of IanXen, the company that developed the app. He says it is cheap and works on the spot. ""So we take a high-definition picture of a sample of blood. We separate the red blood cells from the rest---the white blood cells, the platelets ---and we start looking at each of the red blood cells individually,"" said Viry-Babel.
Viry-Babel says the app is affordable, easy to use and provides reliability of up to 98 percent. The only additional equipment required is an ordinary glass lab slide - called a ""slate.""
""There's only one button, which is called ""Diagnose"". So you put it on the slate and you put it on the dried blood, and you press diagnose and it tells you yes or no,"" he said.
Researchers say the field-testing of the device will begin in January and February in Tanzania, Benin and Indonesia --- while commercial use is scheduled to start by the end of March.
They also plan to expand the versatility of the new device---teaching it to recognize other diseases, such as tuberculosis and Lyme Disease. 
 Question:What can we learn from Viry-Babel? 
A. The app is cheap but must work in the lab. 
B. The white cells and the platelets must be studied carefully. 
C. The accuracy of the app is nearly a hundred percent. 
D. The ""Diagnose"" button should function well with others.

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle?

Context: They survive in some of the coldest environments in the world--but even penguins  appreciate a warm woolly jumper once in a while.
    The mini knitted garments have helped save hundreds of flightless birds caught in oil spills, providing protection from the elements and stopping them from eating poisonous pollution.
    Knits tor Nature,a program run by The Penguin Foundation,which protects the little penguin population of Phillip Island,140km south-east of Melbourne,has created up to 300 different designs over the years--and it's all thanks to talented volunteers.
    ""There's a lot of hidden creativity out there,""said Lyn Blom,of the Phillip Island Nature Park.""People love to know that they're helping the penguins because they're so cute and small and they waddle up the beach and they're so strong and determined.But they need to be,they 1ive in a pretty tough sort of environment.''
    A thumbnail--sized patch of oil can kill a little penguin,the smallest of the species,measuring just l3 inches and weighing l kg.The oil separates and mats their feathers,breaking natural waterproofing and heating functions.
Ms Blom estimates she has knitted between 200 and 300 penguin jumpers over the years.
A staff member read an article in an English women's magazine about knitting for guillemot birds and decided to adapt the designs.
    ""There's a lot of ladies out there who used to knit for their children and grandchildren.These ladies have spare wool and idle hands,and they love to feel loved and needed and we love and need them,""said Ms Blom.
    The Pengu in Foundation recently staged a competition for the most creative jumper,which received an enthusiastic response.
    The Penguin Foundation rescues approximately 20 birds a year.They even have a stockpile of jumpers in case of emergency-such as the large oil spill Phillip Island in 2001. In that instance,453 little penguins were affected,96 percent of which were saved-most thanks to the jumpers. 
 Question:What can we learn from the text? 
A. Only Ms Blom was glad to knit penguin jumpers. 
B. It's Ms Blom that created the penguin jumper designs. 
C. Few people competed for the most creative jumper. 
D. The jumpers have proved effective for penguins. 
 Answer: D
Context: When the swim season began, my 11-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, and I cut a deal. She would go to practice three times a week and try really hard, and I wouldn't make her compete in the swim meets because on the day of a meet, she would be nervous all day. Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down.
Recently, they had a T-shirt relay, which works like this: one person from each relay team puts on a T-shirt and a pair of socks, swims 50 meters, and gets out of the pool. She takes off the clothes and puts them on the next person, who then swims 50 meters. This continues until everyone on the team has completed a lap.
By the last leg, Elizabeth's team had built up a moderate lead. Then it was Elizabeth's turn to swim. She seemed to swim faster in the T-shirt and socks than when she wasn't wearing them.
Approaching the halfway mark, she was still in the lead. Then one of Elizabeth's socks fell off and was floating in the pool. ""She has to get that sock on before the end of the race,"" a swimming official told her team, ""or you will be disqualified.""
Everybody on her team started screaming, ""Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Stop! Get the sock!"" But she couldn't hear them. As she started her last 25 meters, a girl in Lane 2 was gaining on Elizabeth. It was time for desperate measures. A girl on my daughter's team jumped in the pool, grabbed the sock, and swam after Elizabeth. She grabbed Elizabeth's foot. ""You have to put the sock on,"" the girl screamed. Elizabeth continued swimming while her teammate put on the sock.
By now, the girl in Lane 2 was about to pass Elizabeth. With the sock finally on, Elizabeth swam her heart out for the last 15 meters. It was close, but Elizabeth beat the other girl to the wall for the victory.
On the ride home, she relived her moment of glory again and again. She told me that if the T-shirt relay was an Olympic event, her team would win the gold medal. I told her that in my professional opinion, she was absolutely right. 
 Question:Elizabeth was nervous about swim meets because she   _  . 
A. was afraid of disappointing everyone 
B. didn't expect to lose the swim match 
C. didn't want to compete against other girls 
D. was worried about making errors in public

Context: Have you ever walked down a city street and suddenly seen a bright garden full of vegetables and flowers?
It may be a community garden. The community gardens are planted by the people in the community. They are not just pretty places. They improve the neighborhoods.
People first started planting these gardens during the 1970s. At that time, the price of vegetables and fruits was rising. In many city neighborhoods, crime  was increasing. There were also many other problems. People decided to get together to plant gardens to fight against these problems. The gardeners thought they might make the area more beautiful and improve people's life.
These gardeners were right! Community gardens have many benefits. They improve their neighbourhoods. They also make people feel they belong to the community. When people work together in a garden, they feel they are connected with each other. People work on a small area within the garden. They grow vegetables or fruits. Each person decides what he or she is going to grow. However, they also work together to help each other. Some members have gardening experience. They can help those who are just learning how to grow vegetables and fruits.
Sometimes, garden members pay for supplies. The supplies usually include small plants and tools. Many community gardens have sponsors . They pay for the supplies for the gardens. It helps to keep the gardens going every year. Sponsors may be parks, schools and local companies. Some groups want to be a part of the community. They help clean up and beautify a neighborhood. They also pay for the supplies.
Community gardens give people a chance to work together. They can make the community stable . There are many programs of community gardens. Some gardens provide programs for children and elder people. They may provide classes. They may give the vegetables and fruits to poor people. Community gardens also improve air.
Today there are about 10,000 community gardens in cities in the US. They have become popular because of their benefits. People enjoy having vegetables and flowers in their neighborhoods.

A. it was a good way to learn gardening 
B. they liked fresh vegetables and flowers 
C. it helped them get more experience 
D. they wanted to solve the problems 
 Answer: D
Context: Dan Bebber is a senior research fellow at the University of Exeter in Britain. He says research has shown that wild plants and animals are moving toward Earth's North and South poles as the planet warms.
Mr Bebber wanted to know if the same thing was happening with organisms that attack agricultural crops. He examined reports of first sightings of new insects and diseases around the world. The records came from CABI - the Centre for Agricultural Bioscience International. He says the group began collecting information from developing and industrialized countries years ago.
Dan Bebber and his research team studied 612 different organisms - from viruses and bacteria to insects like beetles and butterflies. They found that since 1960, crop pests and diseases have been moving toward the poles at an average rate of about 3 kilometers each year. Mr Bebber says this puts the most productive farmland in the world in danger.
""As new species of pests and diseases evolve and potentially the environment for them becomes more _ at higher latitudes, the pressure on the breadbaskets of the world is going to increase.""
Farmers face other threats. Invasive species passed through trade are also causing problems. Gene Kritsky is an Entomologist at the College of Mount St. Joseph in Ohio. He specialises in the study of insects. He says climate change may improve conditions for some invasive species.
""It means that species in other parts of the world that might do well in warmer temperatures can now do well in the breadbasket of America.""
Another Entomologist Christian Krupke of Purdue University says the effects of these changes will depend very much on the crop, the insect and the disease. But he says the research is a warning sign that people should care about climate change and do something about it. 
 Question:Which of the following is not a threat that farmers have to face? 
A. Climate change helps crop pests to adapt to new environment. 
B. Foreign species are brought in by trade. 
C. Invasive species doing well in warmer places might do well in America. 
D. The impacts of the climate and species changes on crops are not easy to determine. 
 Answer: D

Context: Hospital emergency rooms treat injured fingers all the time. Without treatment, a bad cut can lead to permanent damage. But how should a person know when a bleeding cut is serious enough to require medical attention? We asked Dr Martin Brown, chairman of the department of emergency medicine at Inova Alexandria Hospital in Virginia.
First, the medical term for a cut or tear in the skin is a laceration(,). Dr Brown says the length is usually not as important as the depth. He says a long cut on a finger can likely be treated without a visit to a doctor if the wound is not very deep. ""If you have a short but deep laceration where there's been a structure underneath that's been damaged - a tendon, a nerve, a blood vessel,"" says Martin, ""it may, in fact, need professional attention.""
Some injuries - like a fingertip that gets cut off - might even require surgery to repair. That requires a specialist to either file  down the bone or _ the fingertip. More often, filing down the bone is what is done because reattaching a fingertip is often not successful.
How a wound bleeds can be a sign of how serious it is. Minor cuts usually produce what is known as venous   bleeding. This means the blood flows steadily from the injury. The bleeding will often stop when pressure is put on the wound. Dr Brown says in most cases holding direct pressure with clean gauze or a cloth for four to five minutes should stop the bleeding. With a cut finger, holding the hand above the heart can reduce the loss of blood. But if a cut appears to be pumping blood out with some force, this may be a sign of arterial  bleeding. This kind of injury should be treated by a medical professional as soon as possible.
Even a cut that does not require medical attention must be kept clean to prevent infection. Small cuts should be cleaned gently with clean water. Use a washcloth to clean the area if the wound is dirty. Dr Brown says cuts should be covered with a clean, dry bandage. 
 Question:.The best title of this passage should be  _  . 
A. Hospital Emergency Treatments For Injured Fingers 
B. When a Cut Finger Is More Serious Than It Might Seem 
C. Serious Finger Cut That Requires Medical Attention 
D. Keep Finger Cuts Clean to Prevent Serious Infection 
 Answer: B
Context: A Concussion  happens when the brain is shaken, often in a car crash or a fall or a strike on; the head in sports.Concussions can be mild, but doctors may order a CT scan to look for a more serious injury.But a recent study warned that more children than necessary are being exposed  to radiation this way.
A national team led by two doctors at the University of California, Davis, studied hospital records from thousands of children with head injuries. They found that in many cases, the risk of developing cancer from the radiation outweighed the risk of a serious brain injury.
The study found that one in five children over age two had a low risk of serious injury but received CT scans anyway. The same was true of almost one in four children under two years of age.
The researchers have developed rules to predict if a head injury is serious enough for a scan. For children under two, doctors are advised against it if there is:
*Normal mental activity.
*No swelling in the back of the head.
*No feeling of a broken bone in the skull.  
*And no loss of consciousness for more than five seconds.
Doctors should also consider how the child was injured and whether the parents say the child is acting normally.
For patients from two to eighteen, the guidelines are similar ---- except there should be no l vomiting and no severe headache.
Earlier this year, the British Journal of Sports Medicine published new guidelines for concussions in children and teens. International experts said they should not return to sports or school until fully recovered. The brain also needs a ""cognitive rest,"" they say, by restricting activities like video games, texting and watching TV.
It often take longer than adults to recover from a concussion than adults. The experts say individual progress and not a set time period should always guide a decision to return to play.

A. Four. 
B. Six. 
C. Seven. 
D. Nine.

Context: Driving home from work one evening in the heavy rain, I found a very wet, injured cat on the side of the road. He looked up at me, meowing pitifully. A car must have hit it so it wasn't able to move. I stopped my car and carried the cat in and went on driving.
At the nearest vet clinic, the vet gently examined it. ""He's about eight months old and has two broken legs, but I would need X-rays to know how serious the damage is,"" he told me. ""As he's not your cat, I don't know if you want to go ahead with this. It could be rather expensive.""
I knew it would cost me hundreds of dollars, but I agreed with his advice. The following morning the vet rang to say the X-rays confirmed two bad breaks in his legs. ""I'll operate on his legs and put metal pins in them to keep them fixed."" he told me.
That afternoon I went to pick up my little friend. There I could hardly recognize him. His previously dirty fur was now a beautiful silver grey. His front legs were in two casts and he lay there looking at me, purring  happily.
I thanked the doctor and went out to pay the bill. ""I think you've given me the wrong account,"" I said to the clerk. ""This is only $85. He's had X-rays and an operation on his legs."" ""No, that's right,"" she replied. ""The vet has only charged you for the medication. There's a message on the bottom.""
Written under the total were the words ""SPECIAL RATE FOR ADOPTIONS."" I was speechless at his kind and generous gesture. I paid the account and under his message I wrote ""WITH GRATEFUL THANKS, CAT AND MUM.""

Context: Darek Fidyka, a 38-year-old Bulgarian, had been paralyzed   from the chest down for four years after a knife attack. Scientists from Britain and Poland took cells from his nose, transplanted   them into his back and re-grew his spinal cord  . Now he can walk and even drive a car. The doctors were delighted but said it was the first step in a long journey.
The breakthrough came after 40 years of research by Professor Geoff Raisman, who found that cells had the possibility to repair damage to nasal   nerves, the only part of the nervous system that constantly re-grows. ""The idea was to take something from an area where the nervous system can repair itself and put it into an area that doesn't repair itself,"" Professor Raisman said.
Polish doctors injected   the nasal cells into Mr Fidyka's spinal cord above the injury and used some nerves from his ankle to form a bridge across the damaged tissue. The nasal cells appear to have caused the spinal nerves to repair themselves.
Professor Raisman achieved this with rats in the late 1990's, but this is his greatest success. ""I think the moment of discovery for me was Christmas in 1997 when I first saw a rat, which couldn't control its hand, put its hand out to me. That was an exciting moment, because I realized then that my belief that the nervous system could be repaired was true.""
Doctors chose the easiest case for their first attempt--it might not work for others. But there is a real sense of hope that an idea once thought impossible has been realized.
David Nicholls, who helped provide money for the breakthrough, said information about the breakthrough would be made available to researchers across the globe.
""What you've got to understand is that for three million paralyzed people in the world today, the world looks a totally brighter place than it did yesterday,"" he said. 
 Question:What made Professor Geoff Raisman begin to believe the nervous system can be repaired? 
A. His former study with other people. 
B. His operation on a paralyzed patient. 
C. His sudden thought about Christmas. 
D. His unusual experience with a sick rat. 
 Answer: D
Context: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog.
Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation.
""The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,"" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery.
The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are ""extremely difficult, if not impossible"" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said.
The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face.
The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants,
Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue.
Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality
There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers.
Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant. 
 Question:The best title for the passage would be   _  . 
A. French Woman has First Partial Face Transplant 
B. First Face Transplant Opens Debate 
C. Risks and Ethical Problems of a Face Transplant 
D. A Complete Face Transplant of a French Woman

Context: Imagine you're in a dark room, running your fingers over a smooth surface in search of a single dot the size of this period, How high do you think the dot must be for your finger to feel it?
Scientists have determined that the human finger is so sensitive it can detect a surface bump just one micron(l0-6m)""high. The human eye, by contrast, can't tell anything much smaller than100 microns.No wonder we rely on touch rather than eyesight when faced with a new roll of toilet paper.
Biologically, touch is the mother of all sensory  systems.It is an ancient sense in evolution: even the simplest single-celled living things can feel when something brushes up against them and will respond by moving closer or pulling away. It is the first sense aroused during a baby's development and the last to weaken at life's peak. Patients in a deep coma  who seem otherwise lost to the world will show skin reaction when touched by a nurse.
""Touch ,is so central to what we are that we almost cannot imagine ourselves without it,"" said Chris Dijkerman.""It's 'not like eyesight, where you close your eyes and you don't see anything. _ .It's always there.""
Long ignored in favor of the sensory heavyweights of eyesight and hearing, the study of touch lately:: has been gaining new concern among scientists.They're exploring the effects of recently reported false touch impressions, of people being made to feel as though they had three arms, for example, with the hope of gaining the true understanding of how the mind works.
Others are turning to touch for more practical purposes: to build better touch screen instruments and robot hands, a more well-rounded virtual life.. ""There's a fair amount of research into new ways of offloading information onto our sense of touch,"" said Lynette Jones. ""To have your cell phone buzzing (making a low sound) as opposed to ringing turned out to have a lot of advantages in.some situations.""
Touch is our most active sense, our means of seizing the world and experiencing it 'first hand. Dr.Susan Lederman pointed out that while we can become aware of something by seeing or hear,ing7;-.from a distance and without really trying, if we want to learn about something by means of touch, we must make a move.We must rub the cloth, or pet the cat. Touching is a two-way street, and that's not true for seeing or hearing. If you have a soft object and you squeeze it, you change its shape. The physical world reacts back.""
Our hands are smart and can do many tasks automatically - button a shirt, fit a key in a lock, play the; piano for others.Dr.Lederman and her colleagues have shown that blindfolded subjects can easily recognize a wide range of common -objects placed.in their hands.But on some feeling tasks, touch is all thumbs (very clumsy). When people are given a raised line drawing of a common object, they're puzzled.""If all we've got is outline information;"" Dr.Lederman said,.""no weight, no texture, no temperature information, well, we're very, very bad with that.""
Touch also turns out to be easy to fool, Among the sensory tricks now being investigated is something called the Pinocchio illusion. Researchers have found that if they shake the band of the biceps , many people report feeling that their forearm is getting 'longer, their hand floating ever further from their elbow . And if they are told to touch the forefinger of the shaken arm to the tip of their nose, they feel as though their nose was lengthening, too.

A. sight 
B. taste 
C. hearing 
D. touch

Context: Air is an odorless  , invisible   gas that surrounds the earth. It is everywhere on the planet. An ""empty"" drinking glass and an ""empty"" room, to give two examples, are not really empty. Each is filled with air. When the glass is filled with water, the water pushes the air out of the glass.
Air, as a gas, has no definite   shape, but, because it is matter, it takes up space. It is easy to prove that air is something that takes up space. _ a dry handkerchief into the bottom  of a glass so that it will not fall out when the glass is turned upside-down. Push the upside-down glass; hold it straight into a jar of water till the glass is completely covered. When the glass is taken out of water, the handkerchief will be dry.

Context: The Namib Desert in Africa is one of the driest places on earth.With half an inch of rain falling every year,humans call barely survive there for a week with no water.But the Namib beetle does just fine.It collects morning dew that condenses on its back.
Inspired by this little creature,27--year--old Edward Linacre,a former student from Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne,Australia,has designed a new""Airdrop"" irrigation system which can pull water from even the driest desert air.His invention won the 2011 James Dyson Award,an international design award.Hopes are high that the system will be able to solve the problems of growing plants on dry land,according to the may Mail. 
Linacre studied the Namib beetle and found that it had hydrophilic   skin on its back,which helped catch water molecules passing in the air.These water molecules accumulated into small drops of liquid water.He realized that as long as the air temperature was low enough,even the driest air contains water molecules that can be extracted  .
Following this principle,he designed the new system which works by pumping air through a network of underground pipes to cool it to the point at which water condenses.The water is then delivered directly to the roots of plants.
According to the research,about 11.5 milliliters of water could be collected from every cubic meter of air in the driest desert.Further development could raise that number even higher .
The idea of getting water from the air is not new.However,the Airdrop has certain advantages compared with its competitors.Similar systems often require great amounts of energy because they use refrigeration equipment to lower the temperature.But Airdrop simply uses the temperature difference between the air and the cool earth underground

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle? 
 Answer: A
Context: Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to connect the brain with computers. Braincomputer interface(BCI) technology could help people with disabilities send commands to machines.
Recently, two scientists, Jose Millan and Michele Tavella from the Federal Polytehnic School in Lausanne, Switzerland, show a small robotic wheelchair directed by a person's thoughts.
In the laboratory, Tavella operated the wheelchair just by thinking about moving his left or right hand. He could even talk as he watched the vehicle and guided it with his thoughts.
""Our brain has billions of body cells . These send signals through the spinal cord  to the body part to give us the ability to move. But spinal cord injuries  or other conditions can prevent these weak electrical signals from reaching the body part."" Tavella says. ""Our system allows disabled people to communicate with outer world and also to control machines.""
The scientists designed a special cap for the user. This head cover picks up the signals from the scalp  and sends them to a computer. The computer finds meanings of the signals and commands the wheelchair with an engine. The wheelchair also has two cameras that tell objects in its path. They help the computer react to commands from the brain.
Prof. Millan , the team leader, says scientists keep improving the computer software that finds meanings of brain signals and turns them into simple commands."" The practical possibilities that BCI technology offers to disabled people can be grouped in two kinds: communication, and controlling objects. One example is this wheelchair.""
He says his team has set two goals. One is testing with real patients, so as to prove that this is a technology they can get advantages from. And the other is sure that they can use the technology for long. 
 Question:The team will test with real patients to  _  . 
A. make money from them 
B. prove the technology useful to them 
C. make them live longer 
D. learn about their physical condition 
 Answer: B
Context: What do Napoleon, Clinton and Wang Nan have in common? They are all left-handed. Today about 15% of the people are left-handed. But why are people left-handed? The answer is the way the brain   works. The brain has two halves---the right half and the left half. The right half controls   the left side of the body, and the left half controls the right side of the body. So right-handed people have a strong left brain, and the left -handed people have a strong right brain.
The two halves of the brain are about the same size. But each side controls different things. The left side controls language, Maths and logic  . When you remember new words, or when you put things in order, you use your left side.
The right side of the brain controls colour and music. It is also good at recognizing   faces. This does not mean that all artists are left-handed and all accountants   are right-handed. Some right-handers have a strong right brain, and some left-handers have a strong left brain. 
 Question:Whether people are right-handed or left-handed is mostly decided by   _  . 
A. their parents 
B. their minds 
C. the way the brain works 
D. the way the head works

Context: French doctors and American scientists have reported doing an operation in which the doctor was outside the operating room. This kind of operation is known as robotic operation.
Doctor Marescaux did the operation in an office in New York City last month, while a sixty-eight-year-old woman patient was in a hospital in Strasbourg, France.
A doctor in Strasbourg got the patient ready. He placed medical tools and a small video camera in her stomach area. Doctor Marescaux in New York watched the patient on a video screen. Then he used the computer to send messages to the robot machine. The robot moved the tools that cut the woman's gallbladder away. The woman got well soon after the operation and left the hospital two days later.
Experts say the main problem with such a robotic operation is based on high-speed telecommunications between the doctor and the robot. Technology must be able to send a doctor's order to a robot to move the tools quickly.
Experts also say a successful robotic operation will improve an operation. For example, the robot can make much smaller movements than a person can. A robot machine can turn tools in ways that a doctor's hand cannot.
Doctors say such a robotic operation will make possible safer and better operations in the future. They say it will improve doctor training. It will also mean that doctors could do an operation on people in dangerous places far away. And it could mean that people could have operations done by top doctors without having to travel to the city where doctors work. 
 Question:We use the robot in the operation because   _  . 
A. it can send messages at a high speed 
B. even a top doctor can't do the operation himself 
C. it can make the operation safer and better 
D. operations can be done without any doctors

Context: Recently I spoke to some of my students about what they wanted to do after they graduated, and what kind of job prospects they thought they had.
Given that I teach students who are training to be doctors, I was surprised to find that most thought that they would not be able to get the jobs they wanted without ""outside help"". ""What kind of help is that?"" I asked, expecting them to tell me that they would need a relative or family friend to help them out.
""Surgery "", one replied. I was pretty alarmed by that response. It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job. One girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. ""They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it regrows, you can get at least 5cm taller!""
At that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony  just to be a few centimeters taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!
It seems to me that there is a trend toward wanting ""perfection"", and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.
No one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that ""perfection"" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his chosen career.

Context: Hospital emergency rooms treat injured fingers all the time. Without treatment, a bad cut can lead to permanent damage. But how should a person know when a bleeding cut is serious enough to require medical attention? We asked Dr Martin Brown, chairman of the department of emergency medicine at Inova Alexandria Hospital in Virginia.
First, the medical term for a cut or tear in the skin is a laceration(,). Dr Brown says the length is usually not as important as the depth. He says a long cut on a finger can likely be treated without a visit to a doctor if the wound is not very deep. ""If you have a short but deep laceration where there's been a structure underneath that's been damaged - a tendon, a nerve, a blood vessel,"" says Martin, ""it may, in fact, need professional attention.""
Some injuries - like a fingertip that gets cut off - might even require surgery to repair. That requires a specialist to either file  down the bone or _ the fingertip. More often, filing down the bone is what is done because reattaching a fingertip is often not successful.
How a wound bleeds can be a sign of how serious it is. Minor cuts usually produce what is known as venous   bleeding. This means the blood flows steadily from the injury. The bleeding will often stop when pressure is put on the wound. Dr Brown says in most cases holding direct pressure with clean gauze or a cloth for four to five minutes should stop the bleeding. With a cut finger, holding the hand above the heart can reduce the loss of blood. But if a cut appears to be pumping blood out with some force, this may be a sign of arterial  bleeding. This kind of injury should be treated by a medical professional as soon as possible.
Even a cut that does not require medical attention must be kept clean to prevent infection. Small cuts should be cleaned gently with clean water. Use a washcloth to clean the area if the wound is dirty. Dr Brown says cuts should be covered with a clean, dry bandage. 
 Question:.The best title of this passage should be  _  . 
A. Hospital Emergency Treatments For Injured Fingers 
B. When a Cut Finger Is More Serious Than It Might Seem 
C. Serious Finger Cut That Requires Medical Attention 
D. Keep Finger Cuts Clean to Prevent Serious Infection

Context: They said highly anxious rats which were kept had very low levels of a brain chemical called fibroblast growth factor 2 or FGF2, compared with rats that were more relaxed. But when they improved the anxious rats' living conditions -- giving them new toys to explore and a bigger cage to live in -- levels of this brain chemical increased and they became less anxious.
  ""The levels of this brain chemical increased in response to the experiences that the rats were exposed to. It also decreased their anxiety"". Javier Perez of the University of Michigan said in a telephone interview. ""It made them behave the same way as the rats that were relaxed"", he said.
  In a former study of people who were severely depressed before they died, the team found the gene that makes FGF2 was producing very low levels of the growth factor, which is known primarily for organizing the brain during development and repairing it after injury.
  Perez thinks the brain chemical may be a marker for genetic vulnerability   to anxiety and depression. But it can also respond to changes in the environment in a positive way, possibly by preserving new brain cells.
  While both the calm and anxious rats produced the same number of new brain cells, these cells were less likely to survive in the high-anxiety rats, the team found. Giving the rats better living conditions or injecting them with FGF2 helped improve cell survival.
  ""This discovery may pave the way for new, more specific treatments for anxiety that will not be based on sedation , but will instead fight the real cause of the disease,"" Dr. Pier Vincenzo Piazza from France said in a statement. 
 Question:What's the better way to increase the levels of FGF2? 
A. Introducing more companions to the anxious rats. 
B. Improving the living conditions of the anxious rats. 
C. Injecting the anxious rats with some special medicine. 
D. Giving the anxious rats more time to relax.

Context: If you were asked what your body is made of, probably you would say that it is made of flesh  and bones and covered with skin. You also know something about the blood which flows through it, and that there is a very important part which we call the brain.
But the flesh and the bones make up the largest part of the body, and there is a good deal to be learned about them. You know the general appearance of both flesh and bone from the parts of animals which you see in the butcher's shop.
Bone is hard, and of a white color; indeed, it looks more like a piece of wood or stone than a part of a living animal. But bone is a real part of the living body, and it grows and is nourished  just as the body is. If a man breaks the bone of his arm or his leg, it is firmly bound up, to prevent the broken parts from moving out of the proper places, and in time then bone grows together again and becomes quite strong.
The bones are fastened together by various kinds of joints . They form the framework of the body, and give it strength to retain its proper shape. This framework is called the skeleton . Some animals, such as worms and slugs, have no skeleton; and others, such as shellfish, have a kind of hard covering or skeleton outside.
The most important part of the skeleton is the backbone. It is so important that naturalists divide all animals into two classes,--- those which have a backbone and those which have none. All the higher animals, including man, have a backbone, or vertebral column as it is called. They are therefore called vertebrate  animals. The others are called invertebrate animals. 
 Question:From the passage, we know higher animals are called  _  . 
A. backbone 
B. human beings 
C. vertebrate animals 
D. skeleton

Glass is used to make eyeglasses, microscopes, telescopes, and many other extremely useful and necessary objects.
Until the Second World War, most of the glass used for optical  instruments was imported from Europe. However, during the war Americans could not get European glass, and they were forced to make their own. Therefore, new kinds of glasses were developed that had been previously unknown. These new effects were achieved by mixing other chemical elements with the sand. Some of these new glasses are very strong and can resist many kinds of shocks. Legend has it that a very hard glass was invented by a Roman who showed his discovery to the Emperor. When the Emperor saw the glass he feared that it would become more valuable than gold and sliver, making his treasure worthless. Therefore, he had the glassmaker killed, and the secret was not discovered again for hundreds of years.
In the present century, safety glass was invented for use in modern cars and planes. Safety glass is made by placing a layer of plastic between two layers of plate glass. When the outside layer of glass is broken, the pieces do not scatter  and injure people. Some glass of the type is strong enough to resist bullets .
Although nowadays plastics have replaced glass under conditions where glass might be easily broken, there are new uses being developed, for the greatest advantage of glass is that its component  parts are inexpensive and can be found all over the world. 
 Question:Why did Americans make their own glass during the Second World War? 
A. The war blocked the way of glass import. 
B. The glass made in Europe was out of date. 
C. They refused to use the European glass. 
D. They were able to make a new kind of glass.

Context: Though ""nanometer"" is now a fashionable term all over the world,few people know exactly what it is.It has become a new favorite of manufacturers and sellers in recent years.Many ""high-tech"" products bearing the name ""nano"" have entered the market,bringing more mysterious feeling to surprised consumers.
Nanometer is a very small length unit of measure,and is very small.One millimeter is 1000 micrometers,and one micrometer is 1000 nanometers.That is,one nanometer is one billionth of a meter.Nano materials are solid materials composed of particles or crystallites of less than 100 nanometer in size.Then,is a cup made of nano material really any different from an ordinary cup in function as far as how it works?
Are nano cups really so wonderful?A reporter went to the Institute of Nanomedicine,which is the first such institute of such a sort in the world and the only one in China,specializing in researching the investigation  of the application of nano technology into medicine.
Ji(director Institute of Nanomedicine):
A water molecule is composed of 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom.It can be alterchanged only by special manipulation of the atoms.The material constituting the cup can have a nanometer particles size of the nano level.But it cannot change the chemical and physical properties of the water contained in it.The water in the cup is still water.When people drink it,it will produce no special effect on human body.
Prof.Ji told the reporter,so far,the investigation of nano materials is still confined in the laboratory.No commercial micro products can be produced yet.With the present level of science and technology,the time of everyday goods age of daily use articles made of nanometer materials is still years away.
The commodities labeled with nano marks in the market now are only traditional products coated with a thin layer of nanometer material,which makes them _ .
Prof.Ji explained that nano cup is a real cup.It can also be included in the list of nano products in a certain sense.But the nano cup has not changed its property and function as a cup.It is not a magical medicine for curing and health care. 
 Question:Which of the following shows the right relationship? 
A. nanometer<millimeter<micrometer<meter 
B. nanometer<micrometer<millimeter<meter 
C. micrometer<millimeter<nanometer<meter 
D. millimeter<micrometer<nanometer<meter

Context: In March 2012, researchers in the United States announce that they have developed the first wirelessly controlled device that can supply a drug directly into the body. A small chip is implanted under the skin. It contains the medicine, which it releases at preset times.
The developers say the device could improve the lives of millions of people who take medicine for long-term illnesses.
A company called MicroCHIPS began developing the device about fifteen years ago. Last month, the company released the results of its first successful tests in humans. The tests took place in Denmark with seven women with osteoporosis. 
Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak and break easily. The disorder is common among older people, especially women. Many patients have to give themselves daily injections of medicine. One type of treatment requires injections for two years.
Robert farra is the president of MicroCHIPS. He says many patients stop taking the medicine because of the pain and stress of the injections and that only twenty-five percent of the patients will go through the entire twenty-four months of treatment.
The microchip is a few centimeters long. It has small sections that each hold a single dose of medicine. Mr. Farra says the device has to be programmed with the times to release the drug and that doctors will be able to reprogram the device from a computer or even a cell phone. 
The seven women in the study were aged sixty-five to seventy. The researchers say the implants were just as effective as daily injections. And they say the dosage amounts were more exact than patients often give themselves.
The microchips in the study held only twenty doses of medicine. Mr. Farra and his team are now designing a version that could hold a full year's worth of medicine.
Robert Farra says, ""The new version may take us two years, and then we may be required to do two additional trials, taking about four years before the device is available on the commercial scale."" 
 Question:Which is NOT the advantage of the device? 
A. It can release exact amount of medicine. 
B. It can free patients the pain and stress of injections. 
C. it held only twenty doses of medicine. 
D. It is as effective as daily injections.

Context: Recently hand-foot-mouth disease has spread across China. In the past three months, there have been about 41,846 cases   in 30 provinces and regions. The number is increasing. Eighteen Chinese children have died of the disease so far this year.
What causes the disease and why is it dangerous?
Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common childhood illness. It mainly affects children under the age of 10. It gets its name from the rash   that develops on the hands and feet. It can also cause blisters   in your mouth.
A child who has the disease will usually have a fever, a runny nose and sore throat. He or she doesn't want to eat or drink because of pain in the mouth.
Hand-foot-mouth disease is mostly not serious. The fever and rash clear within a few days. But in some cases, the virus   affects the heart, lungs or brain. This puts the child's life in danger.
A virus causes hand-foot-mouth disease. The disease spreads easily where a lot of young children are together, such as in a child-care center. Sometimes it can also affect teenagers and adults.
In order not to pass on the virus, good hygiene   is important. We should wash our hands as often as possible. Especially we should wash our hands before meals and after going to the toilet.

Context: Scientists say they have discovered a promising treatment for sleeping sickness, a killer disease that infects  about 60,000 people in Africa a year.
British and Canadian experts say drugs could attack the parasite  causing the illness needs to survive. They say the drug could be ready for human medical test in about 18 months.
The disease, spread by the bite of a fly, is caused by a parasite attacking the central nervous system. It has similar symptoms  to malaria , making it difficult to diagnose. Left untreated, it moves to the brain, resulting in mental confusion and final death
The ""breakthrough"" came at the University of Dundee in Scotland, where scientists were offered money to research diseases ignored by major drugs companies.
Professor Paul Wyatt, director of the programme, said: ""This is one of the most significant findings made in recent years in terms of drug discovery and development for ignored diseases.""
He said the research, published in the journal Nature, represented ""significant progress"" in the development of a full blown drug against the disease.
The World Health Organization said there are between 50,000 and 70,000 cases of the disease a year, with a further 60 million people at risk of infection.
The research in Dundee was _ by partners at the University of York in England and the Structural Genomics Consortium in Toronto, Canada. The two drugs currently available to treat sleeping sickness both have problems. One is with side effects that kill one in 20 patients and the other is costly, only partially effective and requires long-time hospital treatment, the scientists said. 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that  _   .

Context: When most of us look at our hands, we might notice that we need to clean, or stop biting our fingernails, and that's about it. But if you ask a doctor, he can see a whole lot more. Everything from poor diet and stress to serious kidney   problems can be revealed by a glance at your fingernails.
There are about 30 different nail signs that can be associated with medical issues, though may indicate more than one problem, according to Dr.Amy Derick, a clinical instructor of dermatology at Northwestern University.
Here are five of the things a doctor can tell about your health based on your fingernails.
1. People who aren't eating well and lack vitamin or dietary may have thinner than normal nails, which are more likely to break.
2.Horizontal   lines are associated with serious physical stress. They frequently occur in people who have gone through chemotherapy .They can also occur after some illnesses, injuries, or with severe malnourishment .Interestingly, there may be an altitude connection too. They've also been found in people who dove 1,000 feet and others who participated in an Everest exploration.
3. Vertical  lines, however, are generally not such a big deal. Some people are more genetically prone to them than others, but they're commonly associated with aging.
4. When people lack iron, their nails can turn spoon-like. Instead of curving down and covering the finger normally, they 'll start to rise up on the sides and front, like the part of a spoon that holds liquid.
5. Kidney and liver problems can create ""half-and-half nails"", where one part of the nail is white and the other part dark or pink, according to Derick.
Doctors note that because disease diagnosis is complex and some symptoms can be associated with different diseases, you should always see a medical professional if you are concerned about something you notice. 
 Question:Who will have horizontal lines on the nails ? 
A. A cancer patient who has received normal treatment. 
B. Hungry African children suffering from severe malnourishment. 
C. An explorer who had reached Zhangjiajie in Hunan Province. 
D. A patient with serious illness, like kidney and liver problems.

Context: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog.
Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation.
""The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,"" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery.
The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are ""extremely difficult, if not impossible"" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said.
The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face.
The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants,
Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue.
Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality
There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers.
Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant. 
 Question:The best title for the passage would be   _  . 
A. French Woman has First Partial Face Transplant 
B. First Face Transplant Opens Debate 
C. Risks and Ethical Problems of a Face Transplant 
D. A Complete Face Transplant of a French Woman

Context: At age 61, identical twins Jeanne and Susan no longer look exactly alike. Susan smoked for many years and is an admitted sun worshipper, whose habits Jeanne does not share. A new study of twins suggests you can blame those coarse wrinkles, brown or pink spots on too much time in the sun, smoking, and being overweight.
Because twins share genes, but may have different exposures to environmental factors, studying twins allows an ""opportunity to control for genetic susceptibility ,"" Dr. Elma D. Baron, at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio, and his colleagues explain in the latest issue of Archives of Dermatology.
Their analysis of environmental skin-damaging factors in 65 pairs of twins hints that skin aging is related more to environment and lifestyle than genetic factors.
But when it comes to skin cancer, the researchers say their findings support previous reports that both environment and genes affect skin cancer risk.
Baron's team examined facial skin of 130 twins, 18 to 77 years old, who lived mostly in the northem Midwest and Eastern regions of the US, who were attending the Twins Days Festival in Ohio in August 2002. At this time, each of the twins also separately reported how their skin burned or tanned without sunscreen, their weight, and their history of skin cancer, smoking, and alcohol drinking. The study group consisted of 52 fraternal and 10 identical twin pairs, plus 3 pairs who were unsure of their twin status.
From these data, the researchers noted strong ties, outside of twin status, between smoking, older age, and being overweight, and having facial skin with evidence of environmental damage. By contrast, sunscreen use and drinking alcohol appeared related to less skin damage.
Baron and his colleagues say the current findings, which highlight ties between facial aging and potentially avoidable environmental factors--such as smoking, being overweight, and unprotected overexposure to the sun's damaging rays--may help motivate people to minimize these risky behaviors. 
 Question:Why did Baron's team do the research on twins? 
A. Twins are more likely to suffer from skin cancer. 
B. It may guarantee the research is not influenced by genetic factors. 
C. It gives others an opportunity to control twins' genes. 
D. It helps find twins are exposed to different environments. 
 Answer: B
Context: The Peales were a famous family of American artists. Charles Willson Peale is best remembered for his portraits of leading figures of the American Revolution. He painted portraits of Franklin and Jefferson and over a dozen of George Washington. His life-size portrait of his sons Raphaelle and Titian was so realistic that George Washington reportedly once tipped his hat to the figures in the picture.
Charles Willson Peale gave up painting in his middle age and devoted his life to the Peale museum, which he founded in Philadelphia. The world's first popular museum of art and natural science mainly covered paintings by Peale and his family as well as displays of animals in their natural settings. Peale found the animals himself and found a method to make the exhibits more lifelike. The museum's most popular display was the skeleton   of a huge, extinct elephant, which Peale _ on a New York farm in 1801.
Three of Peale's seventeen children were also famous artists. Paphaelle Peale often painted still lives of flowers, fruit, and cheese. His brother Rembrandt studied under his father and painted portraits of many noted people, including one of George Washington. Another brother, Rubens Peale, painted mostly landscapes and portraits.
James Peale, the brother of Charles Willson Peale, specialized in miniatures  . His daughter Sarah Miriam Peale was probably the first professional female portrait painter in America.

A. The life of Charles Willson Peale. 
B. Portraits in the 18th century. 
C. The Peale Museum.

Context: A normal conversation between strangers involves more than talk. It also involves the dynamics of space interaction. If one person gets too close, the other person will back up. If the first person invades the other's space again, the other person will back up again. The person who finds himself or herself backing up is trying to increase the distance of the comfort zone. The person closing in is trying to decrease that distance. Most likely neither person is fully aware of what is going on.
In the 1960s, American anthropologist Edward T. Hall was a pioneer in the study of human behavioral use of space. His field of study became known as proxemics.Hall said that personal space for people in the United States can be defined as having four distinct zones: the intimate zone within 18 inches of your body, for whispering and embracing; the personal zone of 18 inches to four feet, for talking with close friends; the social zone of four to 10 feet, for conversing with acquaintances; and the public zone of 10 to 25 feet, for interacting with strangers or talking to a group.
Historians say that our standards of personal space began with the Industrial Revolution in the 18thcentury. In cities such as London and New York, people of different social and economic classes were suddenly crammed together, so they unconsciously developed a commonly understood code of courtesy to restrict the space around them.
People exhibit nonverbal messages of discomfort when their zones are violated. Invaded people might tap their toes, pull at their hair, become completely rigid, or even become angry. As hall noted in his landmark work, a comfortable conversation needs to include the parameters of human personal space. 
 Question:Edward T. Hall identified   _  . 
A. interactions between strangers 
B. angry people 
C. four zones of personal space 
D. the Industrial Revolution

Let followers pass.""If someone's driving after you,get out of his way,""Clark advises.""You're better of being safe than right.""
Expect the worst.In a study,the Federal Highway Administration found that 68 percent of drivers do not come to a complete stop at stop signs.When you're driving and see someone come near to a stop sing,assume the person's not going to stop.
And when you stop at a crossing and another car comes near with its turn signal on,don't take it true that the driver will turn.Instead,wait until he turns.He may have had the signal on for miles.
Stay outside.In crowd,multilane  traffic,drive in either the outside--left or outside--right lane.""That allows you somewhere to go if a problem develops,""traffic expert Francis Kenel says.""If you're in the middle,all you can do is to pause from time to time.""

A. wear seat belt 
B. take some additional measures 
C. at least take 5 steps

Context: Recently hand-foot-mouth disease has spread across China. In the past three months, there have been about 41,846 cases   in 30 provinces and regions. The number is increasing. Eighteen Chinese children have died of the disease so far this year.
What causes the disease and why is it dangerous?
Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common childhood illness. It mainly affects children under the age of 10. It gets its name from the rash   that develops on the hands and feet. It can also cause blisters   in your mouth.
A child who has the disease will usually have a fever, a runny nose and sore throat. He or she doesn't want to eat or drink because of pain in the mouth.
Hand-foot-mouth disease is mostly not serious. The fever and rash clear within a few days. But in some cases, the virus   affects the heart, lungs or brain. This puts the child's life in danger.
A virus causes hand-foot-mouth disease. The disease spreads easily where a lot of young children are together, such as in a child-care center. Sometimes it can also affect teenagers and adults.
In order not to pass on the virus, good hygiene   is important. We should wash our hands as often as possible. Especially we should wash our hands before meals and after going to the toilet. 
 Question:_   can help us to keep away from the hand-foot-mouth disease. 
A. Passing on the virus 
B. Taking children to the child-care center 
C. Keeping your hands clean 
D. Not going to public places

Context: Most children have ever heard their parents yell ""sit up straight!"" or ""don't hang your head !"" when they eat dinner. Nowadays, it is also heard around another activity -- video games. Ten-year-old Owaish admits it takes him three to four hours a day to play games on his tablet computer. In addition, he plays for about two hours on the smart phone every day. As a result, he started suffering a serious pain in the neck around June or July. What's worse the pain has spread to the hand and back gradually, which makes his mother Mehzabin become concerned.
The doctors note the number of young children with the chronic pain  in their necks, arms and shoulders is on the increase sharp in recent years . They are not aging, they haven't had an accident, the blood reports are fine, their X-rays are fine, and their MRIs are fine. Facts have proved that the pain is from the poor posture  while they are playing video games on smart phones or other electronic devices. 19-year -old student Nida feels pain in the finger which holds the weight of her smart phone most of the day. Nida almost uses her smart phone 24/7, which means 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or all the time.
Health experts predict there will be not only physical but mental  problems resulting from the overuse of electronic devices. They encourage people to often take breaks and exercise from using computers, smart phones or other devices. Stand up! Stretch  the legs, back, shoulders and arms in all the possible directions. That's the most effective way and maybe the key to solving the problem completely. After all, the medication doesn't help sometimes.

Context: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog.
Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation.
""The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,"" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery.
The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are ""extremely difficult, if not impossible"" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said.
The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face.
The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants,
Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue.
Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality
There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers.
Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant. 
 Question:The best title for the passage would be   _  . 
A. French Woman has First Partial Face Transplant 
B. First Face Transplant Opens Debate 
C. Risks and Ethical Problems of a Face Transplant 
D. A Complete Face Transplant of a French Woman

Context: A previously unknown kind of human group disappeared from the world so completely that it has left behind the merest piece of evidence that it ever existed -- a single bone from the little finger of a child, buried in a cave in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia. 
    Researchers removed DNA from the bone and reported that it differed obviously from that of both modern humans and of Neanderthals , living in Europe until the arrival of modern humans on the continent some 44,000 years ago. 
    The child carrying the DNA line was probably 5 to 7 years old, but it is not yet known if it was a boy or a girl. The finger bone was unearthed in 2008 from a place known as the Denisova cave. 
    Researchers are careful not to call the Denisova child a new human species, though it may prove to be so, because the evidence is initial. 
    But the genetic material removed from the bone, found in a layer laid down on the cave floor between 48,000 and 30,000 years ago, belonged to a distinct human line that traveled out of Africa at a different time from the two known ancient human species. Homo erectus , found in East Asia, left Africa two million years ago, and the ancestor of Neanderthals moved away some 500,000 years ago. The numbers of differences found in the child's DNA indicate that its ancestors left Africa about one million years ago. 
    The region was inhabited by both Neanderthals and modern humans at that time. Counting the new human line, three human species may have lived together. 
The standard view has long been that there were three human resettlements out of Africa -- those of Homo erectus; of the ancestor of Neanderthals; and finally, some 50,000 years ago, of modern humans. But in 2004, archaeologists reported that they had found the bones of small humans who lived on the Indonesian island of Flores until 13,000 years ago, causing a serious problem to this view. The new line is the second such challenge. 
If the nuclear DNA of the Denisova child should differ as much as its mitochondrial  DNA does from that of Neanderthals and modern humans, the case for declaring it a new species would be strengthened. But it would be unusual for a new species to be recognized on the basis of DNA alone. 
In new diggings starting this summer, archaeologists will look for remains more analytical than the finger bone. Researchers will also begin re-examining the fossil collections in museums to see if any wrongly assigned bones might belong instead to the new line. 
 Question:Which human line is the first challenge to the standard view of human resettlement? 
A. Neanderthals. 
B. Modern humans. 
C. Homo erectus. 
D. Small humans in Indonesia.

Context: In some children who go blind, certain parts of the brain that normally control vision appear to switch jobs and focus instead on sound, a new study has found. 
The study, by researchers at the University of Montreal, involved 7 adults who could see and 12 adults who had lost their vision when they were children. Each participant sat in a room with 16 loudspeakers at different locations. The room was designed so that there were no echoes  During the experiment, the speakers irregularly produced sounds. Participants had to point to where the sounds were coming from. Meanwhile, the researchers monitored blood flow in the brains of the participants to see which brain structures were working during the task. 
The results showed that five of the blind participants were very good at pointing to where sounds were coming from. In these people, blood flow increased in the visual cortex --- an area at the back of the right side of the brain. This part of the brain is usually associated with vision. 
The other seven blind participants showed no increase in activity in the visual cortex. These people didn't do very well at picking out where sounds were coming from. Now, the researchers are looking at whether these people have gained an enhanced  sense of touch instead of sound to replace their lost vision. 
The scientists say that their study shows how adaptable parts of the brain can be. 
 Question:The participants of the experiment were asked   _  . 
A. to identify the direction the sound came from 
B. to take down the time each sound lasted 
C. to tell the difference between 16 sounds

Context: TOKYO -- The number of domestic infections cases of influenza A/H1N1 in Japan hits 42 on Sunday after a total of 34 people in Osaka and Hyogo counties were confirmed to have been infected, local media reported.
The total number of the infection in the country now stands at 46, including the first four cases contracted abroad.
The country is now facing the risk of grass-root outbreak which could lead the WHO to raise its new flu pandemic alert to the highest level of 6 from the current 5, experts has warned.
The 34 newly confirmed domestic cases, 11 in Osaka and 23 in Hyogo, included high school students, college students and teachers, the health ministry and local governments said Sunday.
Japan on Saturday confirmed the first eight cases of domestic infection on students of a Kobe high school. The later confirmed cases in Osaka are said to have contacted the Kobe students in a volleyball match. Osaka and Hyogo are neighboring in the Kansai region.
All of the 42 people had no record of overseas travel.
Meanwhile, a total of 143 students at the Kansai Okura Senior High School where many infections in Osaka were found, have shown symptoms of influenza since around Monday, according to local media reports.
The privately run school said it will be closed from Monday through Saturday.
More than 1,000 educational facilities -- kindergartens, and elementary, junior and senior high schools -- in Osaka and Hyogo counties have decided to suspend classes for certain periods following the confirmation of new flu infections in the counties, Kyodo News reported.
The two counties have requested private schools to follow suit.
Osaka Governor Toru Hashimoto held a meeting of a new flu task force on Sunday and decided to ask facilities such as movie theaters to suspend operations to prevent the spread of the flu.
TV clips showed people in Kansai region started to wear masks in public spaces and rushed to drug stores for buying medicines.
The Japanese government on Saturday shifted the stage of its new-flu action program from ""a period of overseas outbreak"" to ""a period of domestic outbreak"" and called for companies and schools in the areas concerned to allow individuals to avoid commuting  during rush hours.
The Kyodo News quoted Masato Tashiro, a member of the World Health Organization's emergency committee, as saying that several hundred people in Japan already may have been infected with the new flu. 
 Question:Which of the following is one of the measures already taken by the Japanese government? 
A. Raising the new flu pandemic alert to the highest level. 
B. Holding a meeting to ask some facilities in the country to stop their operations. 
C. Calling for individuals in the whole country to avoid commuting during rush hours.

Don't be afraid ----- it's not easy to be infected with the virus. Here are some suggestions to help you protect yourself when it comes.
Wash your hands. You need to wash your hands with soap and hot water before you eat, after you use the toilet, and after you touch animals, because your hands may carry viruses.
Cover your nose and mouth.. When someone sneezes or coughs, flu viruses can travel as far as one meter through the air, so you'd better stand a proper distance while talking to someone who has a cold. And always cover your mouth and nose with a piece of paper when you sneeze or cough, and then clean your hands.
Wear a mask. Some doctors say that masks can stop the flu as much as 80%, but if you don't wash your hands often, it's no use wearing a mask. And it's necessary to wear the mask in the groups of people.
Do sports often. Exercises will help make your body strong enough to
the virus.

Context: Do you know you could get sick just by walking past a building? The bacteria  that cause Legionnaire's disease grow very fast in large modern buildings. They are carried by air through the buildings and outside. Legionnaire s disease is only one of the illnesses that are caused by ""sick buildings"".
Some buildings can make you ill because their heating and air-conditioning  are controlled . Air from outside cannot get in through the closed windows; This indoor air pollution is a growing problem.
Legionnaire's disease may be the most serious result of sick buildings, but other unpleasant illnesses can appear.People who work in some buildings suffer  from tiredness, feeling sick and headaches. Their offices look bright and clean, but invisible  and dangerous bacteria are in the air around them.
There is an answer to the problem. The air-conditioning and heating can be tested for bacteria. _ This is expensive to do, but the results are good. The people in the buildings no longer get sick, and everybody is happier. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE? 
A. Legionnaire's disease is only one of the results of ""sick buildings"". 
B. There is less and less indoor air pollution. 
C. The bacteria are not dangerous if the offices look bright and clean. 
D. If the tests for bacteria are expensive. the results are good. .

Context: For centuries, medical pioneers have refined a variety of methods and medicines to treat sickness, injury, and disability, enabling people to live longer and healthier lives.
""A salamander (a small lizard-like animal) can grow back its leg. Why can't a human do the same?"" asked Peruvian-born surgeon Dr. Anthony Atala in a recent interview. The question, a reference to work aiming to grow new limbs for wounded soldiers, captures the inventive spirit of regenerative medicine. This innovative field seeks to provide patients with replacement body parts.
These parts are not made of steel; they are the real things --- living cells, tissue, and even organs.
Regenerative medicine is still mostly experimental, with clinical applications limited to procedures such as growing sheets of skin on burns and wounds. One of its most significant advances took place in 1999,when a research group at North Carolina's Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine conducted a successful organ replacement with a laboratory-grown bladder. Since then, the team, led by Dr. Atala, has continued to generate a variety of other tissues and organs  from kidneys to ears.
The field of regenerative medicine builds on work conducted in the early twentieth century with the first successful transplants of donated human soft tissue and bone. However, donor organs are not always the best option. First of all, they are in short supply, and many people die while waiting for an available organ; in the United States alone, more than 100,000 people are waiting for organ transplants. Secondly, a patient's body may ultimately reject the transplanted donor organ. An advantage of regenerative medicine is that the tissues are grown from a patient's own cells and will not be rejected by the body's immune system.
Today, several labs are working to create bioartificial body parts. Scientists at Columbia and Yale Universities have grown a jawbone and a lung. At the University of Minnesota, Doris Taylor has created a beating bioartificial rat heart. Dr. Atala's medical team has reported long-term success with bioengineered bladders implanted into young patients with spina bifida (a birth defect that involves the incomplete development of the spinal cord). And at the University of Michigan, H. David Humes has created an artificial kidney.
So far, the kidney procedure has only been used successfully with sheep, but there is hope that one day similar kidney will be implantable in a human patient. The continuing research of scientists such as these may eventually make donor organs unnecessary and, as a result, significantly increase individuals' chances of survival.

Context: One baby born with a defective windpipe   now has hope of breathing normally thanks to 3-D printing technology, NPR reported.
Garrett Peterson, now 18 months old, was born with tracheomalacia  , leaving him unable to breathe. The condition terrified his parents, who turned to specialist Dr. Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment.
Along with Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer who runs the university's 3-D printing lab, Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett's windpipe until it's strong enough to function independently. After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the ""splint"" with a 3-D printer.
""It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,"" Green told NPR.
On January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs?
Though he still remains in the hospital, Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery.  His parents are overjoyed, saying he's starting to act more interactive and alert.
As Garrett grows, the splint will expand and eventually dissolve in his body as his own windpipe strengthens enough to work independently.
3-D printing technology has allowed doctors to help patients in ways that they hope will continue to grow.
""We're talking about taking something like dust and converting it into body parts,"" Green said. ""And we're able to do things that were never possible before."" 
 Question:According to the passage, doctors' attitude toward 3-D printing technology in medical care is   _  . 
A. positive 
B. negative 
C. unknown 
D. indifferent

Context: At Denver there was an crowd of passengers into the coaches  on the eastbound B. & M. express. In one coach there sat a very pretty young woman dressed in elegant taste and surrounded by all the luxurious comforts of an experienced traveler. Among the newcomers were two young men, one of handsome presence with a bold, frank face expression and manner; the other a ruffled, glum-faced person, heavily built and roughly dressed. The two were handcuffed  together.
As they passed down the aisle of the coach the only available seat offered was a reversed one facing the attractive young woman. Here the linked couple seated themselves. The young woman's glance fell upon them with a distant, swift disinterest; then with a lovely smile brightening her face and a tender pink tingeing(,) her rounded cheeks, she held out a little gray-gloved hand. When she spoke her voice, full, sweet, and deliberate, proclaimed that its owner was accustomed to speak and be heard.
""Well, Mr. Easton, if you will make me speak first, I suppose I must. Don't you ever recognize old friends when you meet them in the West?""
The younger man aroused himself sharply at the sound of her voice, seemed to struggle with a slight embarrassment which he threw off instantly, and then clasped her fingers with his left hand.
""It's Miss Fairchild,"" he said, with a smile. ""I'll ask you to excuse the other hand; ""it's otherwise engaged just at present.""
He slightly raised his right hand, bound at the wrist by the shining ""bracelet"" to the left one of his companion. The glad look in the girl's eyes slowly changed to a bewildered horror. The glow faded from her cheeks. Her lips parted in a vague(,), relaxing distress. Easton, with a little laugh, as if amused, was about to speak again when the other forestalled him. The glum-faced man had been watching the girl's face expression with veiled glances from his keen, shrewd eyes.
""You'll excuse me for speaking, miss, but, I see you're acquainted with(,) the officer here. If you'll ask him to speak a word for me when we get to the pen(,) he'll do it, and it'll make things easier for me there. He's taking me to Leavenworth prison. It's seven years for cheating.""
""Oh!"" said the girl, with a deep breath and returning color. ""So that is what you are doing out here? An officer!""
""My dear Miss Fairchild,"" said Easton, calmly, ""I had to do something. Money has a way of taking wings with itself, and you know it takes money to keep step with our crowd in Washington. I saw this opening  in the West,
and
well, an officer isn't quite as high a position as that of ambassador, but--""
""The ambassador,"" said the girl, warmly, ""doesn't call any more. I needn't ever have done so. You ought to know that. And so now you are one of these brave Western heroes, and you ride and shoot and go into all kinds of dangers. That's different from the Washington life. You have been missed from the old crowd.""
The girl's eyes, fascinated, went back, widening a little, to rest upon the glittering handcuffs.
""Don't you worry about them, miss,"" said the other man. ""All officers handcuff themselves to their prisoners to keep them from getting away. Mr. Easton knows his business.""
""Will we see you again soon in Washington?"" asked the girl.
""Not soon, I think,"" said Easton.
.""
""I love the West,"" said the girl irrelevantly. Her eyes were shining softly. She looked away out the car window. She began to speak truly and simply without the gloss of style and manner: ""Mamma and I spent the summer in Denver. She went home a week ago because father was slightly ill. I could live and be happy in the West. I think the air here agrees with me. Money isn't everything. But people always misunderstand things and remain stupid--""
""Say, officer,"" shouted the glum-faced man. ""This isn't quite fair. I'm needing a drink, and haven't had a smoke all day. Haven't you talked long enough? Take me in the smoker now, won't you? I'm half dead for a pipe.""
The bound travelers rose to their feet, Easton with the same slow smile on his face.
""I can't deny a require for tobacco,"" he said, lightly. ""It's the one friend of the unfortunate. Good-bye, Miss Fairchild. Duty calls, you know."" He held out his hand for a farewell.
""It's too bad you are not going East,"" she said, reclothing herself with manner and style. ""But you must go on to Leavenworth, I suppose?""
""Yes,"" said Easton, ""I must go on to Leavenworth.""
The two men sidled down the aisle into the smoker.
The two passengers in a seat near by had heard most of the conversation. Said one of them: ""That officer is a good sort of man. Some of these Western fellows are all right.""
""Pretty young to hold an office like that, isn't he?"" asked the other.
""Young!"" exclaimed the first speaker, ""why--Oh! Didn't you catch on? Say--did you ever know an officer to handcuff a prisoner to his right hand?"" 
 Question:Why did the glum-faced man urge Easton to the smoker? 
A. Because he needed a drink and tobacco badly. 
B. Because he was angry that Miss Fairchild did not say any good words for him 
C. Because he was bored and tired with Miss Fairchild and Easton's talk. 
D. Because he was afraid Miss Fairchild would find the truth.

Context: Learning disabilities are very common. They affect perhaps 10 percent of all children .Four times as many boys as girls have learning disabilities.
       Since about 1970, new research has helped brain scientists understand these problems better. Scientists now know there are many different kinds of learning disabilities and that they are caused by many different things. There is no longer any question that all learning disabilities result from differences in the way the brain is organized.
       You cannot look at a child and tell if he or she has a learning disability .There is no outward sign of the disorder .So some researchers began looking at the brain itself to learn what might be wrong.
       In one study ,researchers examined the brain of the learning-disabled person who had died in an accident .They found two unusual things. One has something to do with cells on the left side of the brain ,which control language. These cells normally are white .In the learning-disabled person, however ,these cells were gray. The researchers also found that many of the nerve cells were not in a line the way they should have been .The nerve cells were mixed together.
       The study was carried out under the guidance of Norman Geschwind, an early expert on learning disabilities. Doctor Geschwind thought that learning disabilities resulted mainly from problems on the left side of the brain .He believed this side of the brain failed to develop normally .Probably ,he said ,nerve cells there did not connect as they should .So the brain was like an electrical device in which the wires were crossed.
       Frank Duffy experimented with this technique at Children's Hospital Medical Center inprefix = st1 /Boston. Doctor Duffy found large differences in the brain activity of normal children and those with reading problems. The differences appeared throughout the brain. Doctor Duffy said his research proves that reading disabilities result from damage to a wide area of the brain, not just the left side. 
 Question:According to the passage we can conclude that further researches should be made to_. 
A. study possible influences on brain development and organization 
B. study how children learn to read and write ,and use numbers 
C. help learning-disabled children to develop their intelligence 
D. explore how the left side of the brain works in language learning

Context: There are various reasons why cancers appear to be on the increase. For one thing, though their sufferers are to be found in all age groups, cancers are particularly likely to attack persons in their middle and advanced years. Naturally, since people live longer these years, there are more cancer sufferers than before. Again, with better methods of diagnosis  , doctors can more easily recognize cancerous growths that would formerly have passed unnoticed or that would have been wrongly diagnosed. It is also believed that certain habits and conditions of modern living, including heavy smoking and the pollution of the air, may leave people living in more cancer-causing conditions than before.
We all look forward to the day when a simple medical test can find cancer while it is still small. Researchers around the world are working on _ . Most of their work deals with the examination of the blood.
Researchers in Boston have found something in the blood of cancer patients that does not appear in healthy persons. The test showed which persons had cancer and which did not. It was correct more than 90 percent of the time.
The researchers believe the test may be able to show cancer very clearly in its development. Cancers discovered early usually can be treated successfully.
The test examines very small bits of fat in the blood called lipids  . Cancers seem to change lipids although doctors do not know why. The test showed differences between the lipids of the persons with cancer and the lipids of those without cancer.
The researchers say the new test could be a step to develop a simple way to check patients for cancer before the disease shows on an X-ray. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. A simple way to cancer 
B. Cancers can be cured 
C. How to find cancer 
D. Early discovery of cancer

Context: Right in the middle of the town are some long ponds . They are only about half a foot deep. The men of Symi dug out the earth to make the ponds.
Over each pond is a low cover. It is made of glass that you can see through.
At night, sea water is taken into the ponds. The next day, the hot sun shines through the covers. The sun light turns the water into vapor  and the vapor goes up from the ponds. The salt is left behind.
As it goes, the vapor became mist. On the inside of each cover, the little drops of mist run together to make big drops. These drops run down the sides of the cover, filling other ponds with fresh water.
The salt left in the ponds is washed out each night. Then more sea water is taken in. The factory is ready for the next day's work. The covers and other parts of the factory cost very little. Sea water and sun cost nothing. Most people of Symi are poor. So to them this new way of getting fresh water seems wonderful.

 Answer: D
Context: In Sonoma County, California, growers are planting grapevines in a new way. As they plant the vines, they add a package of water called DRiWATER. This method of planting grapevines along with the water supply saves time and work. It gives the plant enough water to keep growing. The workers can go on to other chores.
DRiWATER is a package of jelled   water. It melts slowly, watering the plant for two or three months. DRiWATER is a 100% natural, non-poisonous product used for the long-term watering of plants. It was invented by a well-known food chemist who recognized the potential of a filler product he was using to thicken peanut butter. He tested and applied his theory that water could be released over time as naturally occurring microbes   in the soil fed on the filler and released the water into the soil.
The inventor, Harold Jensen, tried for a long time to get the right recipe. He and his family worked nights and weekends testing different formulas. Jensen finally found the right formula and patented it.
What are the ingredients in DRiWATER? It is made up of 97.85% water, 2% vegetable gum, and 0.15% aluminum sulfate. When the DRiWATER is planted in the soil, the water is released as bacteria eat the jell.
Buchanan Vineyard Services has bought ten thousand packages of DRiWATER. They will plant the jelled water with their new grapevines.
What about countries like Egypt that have large deserts? Maybe DRiWATER will help grow trees in the desert. Two million trees have been planted near a town in the Sahara Desert. Two quarts were planted with each tree. The tree must live on the water for months until its roots touch ground water. Harold Jensen hopes to see forests spring up in the deserts. This is the reason that he invented DRiWATER. Seedlings, DRiWATER, and desert may be the perfect fit. 
 Question:What is the best title for the passage? 
A. How to plant grapevines well. 
B. A unique method to supply water to plants. 
C. Harold Jensen: a great inventor. 
D. DRiWATER and the Sahara Desert. 
 Answer: B
Context: Besides providing an ideal environment for sea plants and animals to live in, seawater has other values, one of which is that it constantly moves, and its movements produce energy.
The most obvious movements are waves and the tides. Winds causes the waves, and the gravitational pull of the moon and the son causes tides. In places like the Bay of Fundy in Canada, the difference between the high and low tide level can be as much as 40 feet.
France and Britain are now trying to use energy in the tides to produce electricity. Waves can produce electricity and some experiments are taking place to learn more about this. One of the most encouraging areas of research uses the difference between the temperature of seawater at the surface and deep down to produce electricity. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the following is not true? 
A. The temperature difference of seawater can produce electricity. 
B. The energy in the tides can produce electricity. 
C. Waves can produce electricity. 
D. The plants and animals in the ocean can produce electricity.

Context: Scientists have discovered a gene  that plays a role in violence  in men ill-treated in childhood.The discovery could explain why some experience unhappy childhoods and go on to normal lives, while others turn to violence, crime of antisocial deeds. But it will also restart another argument.
Terrie Moffitt and Avshalom Caspi report in Science today that one common form of a gene in the brain makes men more likely to be violent--but only if they have experienced cruelty or rejection in childhood . The researchers followed up the life histories of 442 boys born in New Zealand in 1972. Of these, 154 had been ill-treated in the first 10 years, 33 of them badly. They had either experienced sexual attack, beatings or rejection by mother or stepparents. Of the 154 children , 55 had a less active variant  of a gene called MAOA, and 99 had the more active variant . The 55 boys were more than twice as likely to have been in trouble as the other ill-treated group . They made up 12% of the total, but were responsible for 44% of all crimes from among the 442 boys.
Prof Moffitt thought a ""violence"" gene had not been discovered. Boys with the less active form who were not ill-treated during childhood lived normal lives. ""It is very common in the population. One third of us have it."" she said, ""So the gene doesn't do much of anything, it doesn't cause any trouble in any way, unless we are also ill -treated"".
The gene might also show the ability to bear mental stress. The army or the police might examine the applicants  to see if they have the more active form . But the discovery also raises the argument that people with the less active form of the gene could be social dangers, to be treated with medicine. ""This research can easily lead people to fix social problems through medical treatment,"" said David King of the UK Gene Alert Group. 
 Question:According to the passage, the less active variant of the gene_. 
A. will totally determine men's character and behavior 
B. always leads to trouble-making 
C. might be responsible for boys' bad deeds 
D. plays no role in children's development

Context: Here is a story told about an American general who was a very important figure in the American army during the First World War. Everybody in the United States knew him and many people wished to have a picture or something of his in their homes.
Soon after the war the general returned to Washington. One day he went to a dentist and had six teeth pulled out. A week later the general heard that his teeth were being sold in curiosity shops as $ 5 each. On each of the teeth there was a label with the name of the general and words: ""Buy these teeth and show them to your friends at home."" The general got angry. He rushed to his office and ordered six officers to go around the city and buy all his teeth.
The officers went out and visited every curiosity shop in the capital. They were away from the office all day. In the evening they returned and put on the table in front of the general the teeth they had bought. They had collected 175 teeth.

 Answer: B
Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle?

The second man is very strong. He says, ""I don't think so. Soldiers use guns. So the soldier is the strongest."" The third man says, ""Soldiers use guns, but our general gives orders. So I think our general is the strongest."" The fourth man is the oldest. He says, ""Love is the strongest. For love, people don't use guns."" The general says nothing. He takes out a medal and gives it to him.

Context: The vitamins necessary for a healthy body are normally supplied by a good mixed diet, including a variety of fruits and green vegetables. It is only when people try to live on a very _ diet, say that when trying to lose weight, that it is necessary to make special provisions to supply the missing vitamins.
An example of the dangers of a restricted diet may be seen in the disease known as ""beri-beri"", which used to make large numbers of Eastern people who lived mainly on rice suffer. In the early years of last century, a Dutch scientist named Eijkman was trying to discover the cause of beri-beri. At first he thought it was transmitted by a germ   . He was working in a Japanese hospital, where the patients were fed on polished rice which had had the outer coverings removed from the grain, it was thought this would be easier for weak and sick people to digest.
Eijkman thought his germ theory was proved when he noticed the chickens in the hospital yard, which were fed on remains from the patients' plates, were also showing signs of the disease. He then tried to separate the germ, which he thought was causing the disease, but his experiments were interrupted by a hospital official, who ordered that the rice without coverings, even though left over by the patients, was too good for chickens. It should be recooked for the patients, and the chickens should be fed on cheap, rough rice with the outer coverings still on the grain.
Eijkman noticed that the chickens began to recover on the new diet. He began to consider the possibility that eating unmilled rice   somehow prevented or cured beri-beri--even that a lack of some ingredient   in the coverings may be the cause of the disease. Indeed this was the case. The element needed to prevent beri-beri was shortly afterwards separated from rice coverings and is now known as vitamin B. The milled rice, though more expensive, was in fact causing the disease the hospital was trying to cure. Nowadays, this terrible disease is much less common thanks to our knowledge of vitamins. 
 Question:What do we know about the disease beri-beri? 
A. It killed large numbers of people. 
B. It resulted from lack of vitamins. 
C. It was transmitted by milled rice. 
D. It was caused by diseased chickens.

Context: Celia was shocked. She had always been in good shape during high school, but now, in her first year of college, she was suddenly ten pounds heavier. ""My friends and I often had pizza or ice cream when we studied late at night,"" she said, ""and I was always drinking Coke to stay awake.""
Celia's experience is common. Many students enter college and find it so different that they cannot deal with changes properly. They're away from their parents and in a new stressful environment. Pressures together with freedom to sleep and eat however they please cause many students to experience the ""Freshman 15"": gaining weight suddenly in their freshman year of college.
Most students do not realize that the ""Freshman 15"" can cause some serious health problems. Of course, college-age adults are still developing bone mass, so gaining some weight is normal. Sudden weight gain, however, puts too much strain on the heart and lungs, resulting in little energy and some difficulty thinking and remembering. In later life, it can lead to heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and possibly cancer.
The solution to the ""Freshman 15"" is simple--pay attention to developing good habits! In general:
* Eat normal-sized meals at regular times. Eat slowly and enjoy it, so you don't need to go back for more.
* Keep only healthy snacks in your room--and don't snack too often!
* Control drinking and smoking. Alcohol has a lot of calories, and smoking too much makes exercise difficult.
* Exercise regularly! Even just 30 minutes a day--such as walking quickly to class from your dorm--will make a big difference! 
 Question:What are students advised to do? 
A. Eat slowly and exercise regularly. 
B. Eat all foods slowly and regularly. 
C. Keep enough healthy snacks in the room. 
D. Eat healthy snacks as much as possible.

Context: Quickly ask yourself: What did you eat today? Now tell me how you actually feel. If you're complaining of stress, anxiety, depression, aches and pains, foggy thinking, or just a general lack of energy, a new medical theory will blow your mind. The chances are that those disease-like symptoms are all the result of what's called hidden food allergies .
This is what Ken Drew found out when he was lucky enough to be recommended to medical practitioner Dr. Patel. Patel is considered something of a genius, and has been called a modern day Louis Pasteur. You've heard of him, of course--Pasteur figured out how to keep milk from getting spoiled. Dr. Patel is like a Louis Pasteur for keeping your body from getting spoiled from chronic  diseases.
""Foggy thinking, slightly constipated , heart pain,...you name it. It's part of getting old,"" you say. ""It's just stress."" Most of the body's immune defenses are all located in your stomach, so when you have a hidden food allergy and you expose yourself to harmful foods, your defenses malfunction  and disease-carrying bacteria take over. Had you not eaten that one food you were allergic to for breakfast, you would never have got sick.
Together, Dr Patel and Ken Drew have developed the Reverse My Disease program, which claims it can _ your body against diseases like arthritis , Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease and cancers. You won't need a prescription and there isn't any kind of medical procedure involved. There's no medical jargon, no complicated diet to do. What it does do is claim to tell you how to hack your body's natural defense system.

Context: Women are friendly. But men are more competitive. Why? Researchers have found it's all down to the hormone oxytocin . Although known as the love hormone, it affects the sexes differently.
""Women tend to be social in their behavior. They often share with others. But men tend to be competitive. They are trying to improve their social status,"" said Professor Ryan.
Generally, people believe that the hormone exytocin is let out in our body in various social situations and our body creates a large amount of it during positive social interaction such as falling in love or giving birth.
But in a previous experiment Professor Ryan found that the hormone is also let out in our body during negative social interactions such as envy.
Further researches showed that in men the hormone oxytocin improves the ability to recognize competitive relationships, but in women it raises the ability to recognize friendship.
Professor Ryan's recent experiment used 62 men and women aged 20 to 37.
Half of the participants received oxytocin. The other half received placebo . [( )] [( :Love my Dog.)] 
After a week, the two groups switched with participants. They went through the same procedure with the other material.
Following each treatment, they were shown some video pictures with different social interactions. Then they were asked to analyze the relationships by answering some questions. The questions were about telling friendship from competition. And their answers should be based on gestures, body language and facial expressions.
The results indicated that, after treatment with oxytocin, men's ability to correctly recognize competitive relationships improved, but in women it was the ability to correctly recognize friendship that got better.
Professor Ryan thus concluded: ""Our experiment proves that the hormone oxytocin can raise people's abilities to better distinguish different social interactions. And the behavior differences between men and women are caused by biological factor that are mainly hormonal."" 
 Question:Why did Professor Ryan conduct the recent experiment? 
A. To test the effect of oxytocin on the ability to recognize social interactions. 
B. To know the differences between friendship and competition. 
C. To know people's different abilities to answer questions. 
D. To test people's understanding of body language. 
 Answer: A
Context: Sex prejudices are based on and justified by the ideology  that biology is destiny. According to this ideology, basic biological and psychological differences exist between the sexes. These differences require each sex to play a separate role in social life. Women are the weaker sex both physically and emotionally. Thus, they are naturally suited, much more so than men, to the performance of domestic  duties. A woman's place, under normal circumstances, is within the protective environment of the home. Nature has determined that women play caretaker roles, such as wife and mother and homemaker. On the other hand, men are best suited to go out into the competitive world of work and politics, where serious responsibilities must be taken on. Men are to be the providers; women and children are ""dependents"".
The ideology also holds that women who wish to work outside the household should naturally fill these jobs that are in line with the special capabilities of their sex. It is appropriate for women, not men, to be employed as nurses, social workers, elementary school teachers, house-hold helpers, clerks and secretaries. These positions are simply an extension of women's domestic role. Informal distinctions between ""women's work"" and ""men's work"" in the labor force, according to the ideology, are simply a functional reflection of the basic differences between the sexes.
Finally, the ideology suggests that nature has worked her will in another significant way. For the human species to survive over time, its members must regularly reproduce. Thus, women must, whether at home or in the labor force, make the most of their physical appearances.
So goes the ideology. It is, of course, not true that basic biological and psychological differences between the sexes require each to play sex-defined roles in social life. There is enough evidence that sex roles vary from society to society, and _ 
But to the degree people actually believe that biology is destiny and that nature intended for men and women to make different contributions to society, sex-defined roles will be seen as totally acceptable. 
 Question:According to the biology-is-destiny ideology, women  _  . 
A. cannot compete with men in any field 
B. are suited more to domestic jobs than men 
C. are sensitive enough to be a good caretaker 
D. are too weak to do any agricultural work at all 
 Answer: B
Context: Do women's minds work the same as men's? Absolutely not. At least, that is what most men are convinced of. Psychologists view the subject either as a matter or frustration or a joke. Now the biologists have moved into this minefield, and some of them have found that there are real differences between the brains of men and women. But being different, they point out hurriedly, is not the same as being better or worse.
There is, however, a definite structural variation between the male and female brain. The difference is in a part of the brain that is used in the most complex intellectual processes-the link between the two halves of the brain.
The two halves are linked by a trunkline of between 200 and 300 million nerves, the corpus callosum. Scientists have found quite recently that the corpus callosum in women is always larger and probably richer in nerve fibres than it is in men. This is the first time that a structural difference has been found between the brains of women and men and it must have some significance. The question is ""What?"", and, if this difference exists, are there others? Research shows that present-day women think differently and behave differently from men. Are some of these differences biological and inborn, a result of evolution? We tend to think that is the influence of society that produces these differences. But could we be wrong?
Research showed that these two halves of the brain had different functions, and that the corpus callosum enabled them to work together. For most people, the left half is used for word handing, analytical and logical activities; the right half works on pictures, patterns and forms. We need both halves working together. And the better the connections, the more harmoniously the two halves work. And, according to research findings, women have the better connections.
But it isn't all that easy to explain the actual differences between skills of men and women on this basis. In schools throughout the world girls tend to be better than boys at ""language subjects"" and boys better at maths and physics. If these differences correspond with the differences in the hemispheric trunkline, here is an unalterable distinction between the sexes.
We shan't know for a while, partly because we don't know of any precise relationship between abilities in school subject and the functioning of the two halves of the brain, and we cannot understand how the two halves interact via the corpus callosum. But this striking difference must have some effect and, because the difference is in the parts of the brain involved in intellect, we should be looking for differences in intellectual processing. 
 Question:At the end of the passage the author proposes more work on   _  . 
A. the brain structure as a whole 
B. the functioning of part of the brain 
C. the distinction between the sexes 
D. the effects of the corpus callosum

Context: Depression is much higher amongst female bosses than male bosses,a new US survey finds.Dr Tetyana Pudrovska,the study's first author,explained:""Women with job authority-the ability to hire,fire,and influence pay-have greatly more symptoms of depression than women without this power.But men with job authority have fewer symptoms of depression than men without such power.""
The study followed 1,500 middle-aged women and 1,300 middle-aged men who all graduated from high schools in Wisconsin.The men and women were surveyed in 1993 and 2004 to look at the connection between how much authority they had at work and symptoms of depression.
The results showed that amongst men and women with lower levels of authority at work,women had slightly higher levels of depression.This is normal since overall women suffer from depression slightly more than men.Amongst men and women with higher levels of authority at work,however,it was women who had many more symptoms of depression than men.Men in authority actually had a 10% lower risk of depression,while authority increased the risk of women having depressive symptoms by 9%.
Dr Pudrovska continued:""What shocked us is that women with job authority in our study are advantaged in terms of most characteristics that are strong signs of positive mental health.These women have more education,higher incomes,better jobs,and higher levels of job satisfaction than women without job authority.Yet,they have worse mental health than lower-status women.""
The cause of this _ is not known,but Dr Pudrovska says:""Years of social science research suggests that women in authority positions deal with interpersonal anxiety,negative social interactions,negative stereotypes,prejudice,social isolation ,as well as resistance from colleagues.Women in authority positions are viewed as lacking in the assertiveness and confidence of strong leaders.But when these women display such characteristics,they are judged negatively for being unfeminine .This causes mental stress.""
Men,on the other hand,do not have to face these kinds of negative stereotypes about their abilities. 
 Question:Which of the following might be the best title of the passage? 
A. Female bosses get less stress from work than male bosses. 
B. Female bosses get the same stress from work as male bosses. 
C. Female bosses get the same stress from work as employees. 
D. Female bosses get more stress from work than male bosses.

Context: Today, the biggest killers stem as much from our lifestyles as from bacteria and viruses.  One of the worst of these is heart disease, and specifically high blood pressure. It's a slow, but efficient killer that robs many people of what should be the last 10, 20 or 30 years of their lives.
Scientists are claiming that they have now separated unusual ingredients in a rare seaweed discovered by fishermen off the coast of Korea that offer incredible health benefits--including the ability to restore blood pressure to normal levels.
Dr. Haengwoo Lee, a famous biochemist conducted a clinical study on these two ingredients. The first is Seanol, an extremely rare seaweed extract  from Ecklonia Cava that's proven to be 100 times more powerful than any land-based antioxidant . That's because it stays working in your body for 12 hours, compared to land-based antioxidants that work for 30 minutes.  ""Its secret is its make-up of special chemicals that are a huge 40% fat soluble( ),"" Dr. Lee explains. ""Unlike nearly all land-based antioxidants that are water soluble, Seanol's protective compounds can get into things like the fatty tissues of your brain and penetrate  all three layers of your cells, including the outside, the oil-based cell membranes , and your DNA."" Indeed, Seanol is so powerful, it's the only FDA-approved Ecklonia Cava marine-algae    extract in existence.
The second ingredient is Calamarine, a deep-sea omega-3 discovery that delivers 85% more DHA omega-3s to your heart, brain, joints, and eyes. It's known to reduce the problems from tiredness and poor memory, joint pain, mood swings and depression.
With that research in mind, Dr. Lee combined Seanol and Calamarine with a high dose of vitamin D to form  Marine-D3, the newest supplement in the fight against age-related illnesses and high blood pressure.
Dr. Lee found that Calamarine delivers some of the greatest concentration of omega-3s known to science. Combined with Seanol's ability to reduce body inflammation , as well as help cells get the nutrients they need to thrive, stay healthy and protected, Marine-D3 is able to boost a body's entire well being.
The makers of Marine-D3 are so confident that you'll see fast dramatic results from this product, that if you aren't happy after two full months, simply return the unused portion and they'll buy it back. They'll even give you ten dollars extra just for giving it an honest try! That kind of faith, combined with Dr. Lee's exhaustive research, shows that Marine-D3 really is a one-of-a-kind product. 
 Question:What's the makers' attitude toward Marine-D3? 
A. pessimistic 
B. indifferent 
C. doubtful 
D. Optimistic 
 Answer: D
Context: Plants need green leaves to make food. A plant needs sunlight and carbon dioxide  from the air for making food and it also needs water and salts from the soil to make food too. There are certain cells   in the leaves which change carbon dioxide and water into sugar. To do this the cells needs energy, which they get from the sunlight.
Green leaves make food for the whole plant. A red leaf can make food too because under the red color1ing of the leaf there are food----making cells. There are no leaves which are completely yellow, for they can't make food.
The plant makes sugar for its food. In sunlight green leaves make a lot of sugar. The veins   can't carry all this sugar away, so the leaves change the sugar into starch  , which is kept and so stored in the leaves. At night, the starch changes back to sugar. It is then carried away from the leaves. Some of the sugar is used as food by the plant while the rest is stored as starch. In some plants, food is stored in the roots, in others it is stored in the stem   and in leaves, fruits and seeds. 
 Question:Sugar is made for its food by   _  . 
A. sunlight 
B. veins 
C. stems 
D. green leaves

Context: One Monday morning, Paul and his classmates were in science laboratory for their practical chemistry lesson. The students were going to work in pairs to do an experiment. Before they began, the teacher gave them this description of the different stages of the experiment.
Stage 1: Prepare the equipment: a test tube, a crucible, a Bunsen burner and tongs.
Stage 2: Weigh 5 grams of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and put it in a crucible.
Stage 3: Heat 10 ml of hydrochloric acid   in a test tube.
Stage 4: Pour the warm acid onto the baking soda and continue to heat the mixture.
Result: The acid reacts with the bicarbonate to form water, carbon dioxide gas and salt. The hotter the mixture, the quicker the reaction. Continue to heat the mixture until the water evaporates, leaving the salt in the crucible.
Paul and his partner followed the instructions and set up their equipment. Paul went to the cupboard to get a bottle of hydrochloric acid. He found that there was only one bottle in the cupboard so he took that. There was no label on the bottle and Paul didn't check with the teacher if it was the right solution.
He measured the liquid and poured it into a test tube. Using tongs to hold the test tube, he heated it over the Bunsen burner. That's when things started to go wrong. The liquid in the test tube was not hydrochloric acid. When it was heated, it formed a thick cloud of white gas. Soon the room was full of this strong smelling white gas.
All the students started coughing and their eyes hurt. The teacher immediately opened the windows and ordered the students to leave the laboratory at once. She realized that the liquid was a crylamide   and that it is poisonous.
Fortunately, nobody was injured in the incident. However, it taught the students and the teacher a good lesson. 
 Question:Why did the teacher send the students out of the classroom? 
A. Becausethe room was full of this strong smelling white gas. 
B. Because all the students started coughing and their eyes hurt. 
C. Becausethe liquid was a crylamide and that it is poisonous. 
D. Because someone was injured in the incident.

Context: Have you ever noticed that people have thinner arms and legs as they get older? As we age it becomes harder to keep our muscles healthy. They get smaller, which reduces strength and increases the possibility of falls and fractures  . New research is showing how this happens and what to do about it.
A team of Nottingham researchers has already shown that when older people eat, they cannot make muscle as fast as the young. Now they've found that the ability to prevent muscle breakdown is reduced with age.
When older people eat, they don't build enough muscle with the protein in food; also, the insulin   fails to shut down the muscle breakdown that rises between meals and overnight. Normally, in young people, insulin acts to slow muscle breakdown.
The research just published compared one group of people in their late 60s to a group of 25-year-olds, with equal numbers of men and women. ""We studied our subjects first -- before breakfast -- and then after giving them a small amount of insulin to raise the hormone  to what they would be if they had eaten breakfast,"" Professor Rennie said.
"" The results were clear. The younger people's muscles were able to use insulin we gave to stop the muscle breakdown, which had increased during the night. The muscles in the older people could not. In the course of our tests, we also noticed that the blood flow in the leg was greater in the younger people than the older ones,"" added Professor Rennie. 
However, scientists think that weight training may reactivate muscle blood flow and help retain   muscles for older people. ""In fact, doing exercise three times a week over 20 weeks reactivates the leg blood flow responses of older people. They became identical to those in the young,"" said Professor Rennie. 
 Question:The researchers seemed to believe that   _  . 
A. older people can't make muscles any more 
B. eating fast will help make more muscles 
C. young people make muscles more quickly when eating 
D. older people are not able to stop muscles breakdown

Context: Since ancient times, people have known about its ability to reduce pain and high body temperature. More than 2000 years ago, the Greek doctor Hippocrates advised his patients to chew on the bark and leaves of the willow.
The tree contains a chemical called salicin . From salicin, researchers in the 1800s discovered how to make salicylic acid . And in 1897, a chemist named Felix Hoffmann at Friedrich Bayer and Company in Germany created acetyl salicylic acid. Later it became the active substance in a new medicine that Bayer called aspirin. The ""a"" came from acetyl. The ""spir"" came from the spirea plant, which also produces salicin. And the ""in"" Well, that is a common way to end medicine names.
In 1982, a British scientist shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in part for discovering how aspirin works. Sir John Vane found that aspirin blocks the body from making natural substances called prostaglandins .Prostaglandins have several effects on the body. Some cause pain and the expansion, or swelling( ; ), of damaged tissue. Others protect the lining of the stomach and small intestine. Prostaglandins also make the heart, kidneys and blood vessels  work well. But there is a problem. Aspirin works against all prostaglandins, good and bad. Scientists learned how aspirin interferes with an enzyme . One form of this enzyme makes the prostaglandin that causes pain and swelling. Another form of the enzyme creates a protective effect. So aspirin can reduce pain and swelling in damaged tissues. But it can also harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine . 
 Question:What can we know about aspirin according to the passage? 
A. Aspirin can treat almost diseases. 
B. Aspirin can create the protective enzyme. 
C. Aspirin can harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
D. Aspirin can protect the inside of the stomach and small intestine.

Context: Did you ever wonder who invented products like Liquid Paper, Kevlar or paper bags? Most would think a man invented these items. Guess what? Women invented each of these. What? You don't believe me? Well, read this:
Liquid Paper was invented by Bette Nesmith Graham in 1951 and originally called Mistake Out. Being a typist, Bette was increasingly _ with being unable to erase her typing mistakes. The messy business left her hands black and the paper dirty. Bette was good at painting and remembered that an artist paints over mistakes. She applied that same principle to typing mistakes and Liquid Paper was born, making Bette into a self-made millionaire.
Kevlar, yes, the Kevlar of the bullet proof vest --what police officers and soldiers wear, was invented by Stephanie Kwolek. Stephanie worked for the DuPont Company as a research chemist. She was asked to find a high-performance fiber. Originally, this fiber was intended to be used for car tires  . However, the fiber she developed in 1964 was amazing and is still used in products such as sailboats, skis, shoes, and yes, bullet proof vests. In 1995 Stephanie was named to the National Inventor's Hall of Fame.
Margaret Knight invented a machine that revolutionized the making of paper bags. Paper bags had been made like envelopes but Margaret developed a machine that would fold and paste a flat-bottom paper bag, the very same type we still use today. Margaret's family was poor and she started working at the age of nine. Her first invention at the age of twelve was a safety tool for a loom . Later she worked for the Columbia Paper Bag Company. It was there that she worked on improving the making of paper bags. She was issued her patent in 1870.
So next time you use a new product or an old one, will you wonder who made it? Do some research on the web and answer a few questions like: Who invented it? How was it invented? You may be surprised at some of the stories you uncover. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. How inventions were made 
B. Amazing inventions by women 
C. Women and modern technology 
D. You can also be an inventor

Context: One Monday morning, Paul and his classmates were in science laboratory for their practical chemistry lesson. The students were going to work in pairs to do an experiment. Before they began, the teacher gave them this description of the different stages of the experiment.
Stage 1: Prepare the equipment: a test tube, a crucible, a Bunsen burner and tongs.
Stage 2: Weigh 5 grams of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and put it in a crucible.
Stage 3: Heat 10 ml of hydrochloric acid   in a test tube.
Stage 4: Pour the warm acid onto the baking soda and continue to heat the mixture.
Result: The acid reacts with the bicarbonate to form water, carbon dioxide gas and salt. The hotter the mixture, the quicker the reaction. Continue to heat the mixture until the water evaporates, leaving the salt in the crucible.
Paul and his partner followed the instructions and set up their equipment. Paul went to the cupboard to get a bottle of hydrochloric acid. He found that there was only one bottle in the cupboard so he took that. There was no label on the bottle and Paul didn't check with the teacher if it was the right solution.
He measured the liquid and poured it into a test tube. Using tongs to hold the test tube, he heated it over the Bunsen burner. That's when things started to go wrong. The liquid in the test tube was not hydrochloric acid. When it was heated, it formed a thick cloud of white gas. Soon the room was full of this strong smelling white gas.
All the students started coughing and their eyes hurt. The teacher immediately opened the windows and ordered the students to leave the laboratory at once. She realized that the liquid was a crylamide   and that it is poisonous.
Fortunately, nobody was injured in the incident. However, it taught the students and the teacher a good lesson.

Context: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog.
Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation.
""The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,"" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery.
The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are ""extremely difficult, if not impossible"" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said.
The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face.
The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants,
Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue.
Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality
There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers.
Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant. 
 Question:The best title for the passage would be   _  . 
A. French Woman has First Partial Face Transplant 
B. First Face Transplant Opens Debate 
C. Risks and Ethical Problems of a Face Transplant 
D. A Complete Face Transplant of a French Woman

Context: Here's a story about a very interesting family. A young man once went into town and bought himself a pair of trousers. When he got home, he went upstairs  to his bedroom and put them on. He found that they were about two inches too long.
He came downstairs, where his mother and his two sisters were washing up tea things in the kitchen. ""These new trousers are too long."" He said. "" They need shortening  by about two inches. Would one of you mind doing this for me, please?"" His mother and sisters were busy and they said nothing.
But as soon as his mother had finished washing up, she went quietly upstairs to her son's bedroom and shortened the trousers by two inches. She came downstairs without saying anything to her daughters.
Later on, after supper, the elder sister remembered her brother's trousers. She was a kind-hearted girl, so she went quietly upstairs without saying anything to anyone and shortened the trousers by two inches.
The younger sister went to the cinema, but when she came back, she, too, remembered what her brother had said. So she ran upstairs and took two inches off the legs of the new trousers. 
 Question:Who is the last to shorten his new trousers ? 
A. his young sister 
B. his mother 
C. his elder sister 
D. himself

Context: What will man be like in the future -- in 5,000 or even 50,000 years from now? We can only make guesses, of course, but we can be sure that he will be different from what he is today, for man is slowly changing all the time.
Let us take an obvious example. Man, even five hundred years ago, was shorter than he is today. Now, on average, men are about three inches taller. Five hundred years is relatively a short period of time, so we may suppose that man will continue to grow taller. Again, in the modern world we use our brains a great deal. Even so, we still make use of only about 20% of the brain's capacity . As time goes on, however, we shall have to use our brains more and more, and finally we shall need our brains more and more, and finally we shall need larger ones! This is likely to bring a physical change too: the head, in particular the forehead, will grow larger.
Nowadays our eyes are in constant use. In fact, we use them so much that very often they become weaker and we have to wear glasses. But over long period of time it is likely that man's eyes will grow stronger.
On the other hand, we tend to make less use of our arms and legs. These, as a result, are likely to grow weaker. At the same time, however, our fingers will grow more sensitive because they are used a great deal in modern life.
But what about hair? This will probably disappear from the body altogether in course of time because it does not serve a useful purpose any longer. In the future, then, both sexes are likely to be bald.
Perhaps all this gives the impression that future man will not be a very attractive creature to look at! This may well be true. All the same, in spite of all these changes, future man will still have a lot in common with us. He will still be a human being, with thoughts and motions similar to our own. 
 Question:The passage mainly tells us that   _  . 
A. Man's life will be different in the future 
B. Future man will look quite different from us 
C. Man is growing taller and uglier as time passes 
D. Man's organs' functions will change 
 Answer: B
Context: Often speakers at a meeting experience dry mouths and ask for a glass of water.You can solve the problem by activating the saliva in you mouth.First gently bite the edges of your tongue with your teeth.Or,press your entire tongue to the bottom of your mouth and hold it there until the saliva flow.Or you can imagine that you are slicing a big juicy lemon and sucking the juice.
Before you begin your talk,be kind to your voice.Avoid milk or creamy drinks which coat your throat.Keep your throat wet by drinking a little sweetened warm tea or water-down fruit juice.
If you sense that you are losing your voice,stop talking completely.Save your voice for your speech.You may feel foolish using paper to write notes,but the best thing you can do is to rest your voice.If you feel the need to see a doctor,perhaps getting some advice from a professional singer can be a better choice.In the meantime,do not even talk in a low voice.
What about drinking alcohol to wet your throat?I advise you not to touch alcohol before speaking.The problem with alcohol is that one drink gives you a little confidence.The second drink gives you even more confidence.Finally you will feel all-powerful and you will feel you can do everything,but in fact your brain and your mouth do not work together properly.Save the alcohol until after you finish speaking.
Perhaps you want to accept the advice,but you may wonder if you can ever change the habits of a lifetime.Of course you can.Goethe,who lived before indoor skating rinks or swimming pools,said,""We learn to skate in the summer and swim in the winter.""Take this message to heart and give yourself time to develop your new habits.If you are wiling to change,you will soon be able to say that you will never forget these techniques because they've become a part of your body.

Context: Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do.

A. has little to do with culture 
B. has much to do with culture 
C. is ever changing

Context: One Monday morning, Paul and his classmates were in science laboratory for their practical chemistry lesson. The students were going to work in pairs to do an experiment. Before they began, the teacher gave them this description of the different stages of the experiment.
Stage 1: Prepare the equipment: a test tube, a crucible, a Bunsen burner and tongs.
Stage 2: Weigh 5 grams of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and put it in a crucible.
Stage 3: Heat 10 ml of hydrochloric acid   in a test tube.
Stage 4: Pour the warm acid onto the baking soda and continue to heat the mixture.
Result: The acid reacts with the bicarbonate to form water, carbon dioxide gas and salt. The hotter the mixture, the quicker the reaction. Continue to heat the mixture until the water evaporates, leaving the salt in the crucible.
Paul and his partner followed the instructions and set up their equipment. Paul went to the cupboard to get a bottle of hydrochloric acid. He found that there was only one bottle in the cupboard so he took that. There was no label on the bottle and Paul didn't check with the teacher if it was the right solution.
He measured the liquid and poured it into a test tube. Using tongs to hold the test tube, he heated it over the Bunsen burner. That's when things started to go wrong. The liquid in the test tube was not hydrochloric acid. When it was heated, it formed a thick cloud of white gas. Soon the room was full of this strong smelling white gas.
All the students started coughing and their eyes hurt. The teacher immediately opened the windows and ordered the students to leave the laboratory at once. She realized that the liquid was a crylamide   and that it is poisonous.
Fortunately, nobody was injured in the incident. However, it taught the students and the teacher a good lesson. 
 Question:What substance were the students making in the experiment? 
A. Water 
B. Carbon dioxide gas 
C. Salt 
D. Poisonous gas

Context: The size and shape  of your ears show your character more than any other parts of the face. Other parts of the face change shape as we get older, but ears do not change their shape. They only change in size.
Reading people's character from their ears is an old science. In very old times people thought that a person with big ears had a good and generous character. They thought that a person with pale, small ears was dangerous. They also thought that the shape of the ear showed if a person was musical. Today, too many people believe that the size and the shape of the ear help you know if a person is musical.
Ears are all different, and each characteristic has a meaning. Next time when you look at a person, see if his ears are large, medium-size or small. Look at the lobes (the lowest part of the ear). Do they stick to the face? Ears that are always red mean a person may easily get angry, or he / she just has high blood pressure  . Ears that are always cold and pale mean a person has a nervous character. And a big inside hole of the ear means a person is musical. 
 Question:We can guess Beethoven (a world-famous musician) may have. 
A. ears with a big inside hole 
B. round white ears 
C. ears with a hole in the lobes 
D. big red ears

Context: Air is an odorless  , invisible   gas that surrounds the earth. It is everywhere on the planet. An ""empty"" drinking glass and an ""empty"" room, to give two examples, are not really empty. Each is filled with air. When the glass is filled with water, the water pushes the air out of the glass.
Air, as a gas, has no definite   shape, but, because it is matter, it takes up space. It is easy to prove that air is something that takes up space. _ a dry handkerchief into the bottom  of a glass so that it will not fall out when the glass is turned upside-down. Push the upside-down glass; hold it straight into a jar of water till the glass is completely covered. When the glass is taken out of water, the handkerchief will be dry. The air inside the glass takes up space and keeps the water from coming in.

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle?

A. with a slim figure 
B. with high blood pressure

D. who seek for a healthy diet 
 Answer: C
Context: Today, the biggest killers stem as much from our lifestyles as from bacteria and viruses.  One of the worst of these is heart disease, and specifically high blood pressure. It's a slow, but efficient killer that robs many people of what should be the last 10, 20 or 30 years of their lives.
Scientists are claiming that they have now separated unusual ingredients in a rare seaweed discovered by fishermen off the coast of Korea that offer incredible health benefits--including the ability to restore blood pressure to normal levels.
Dr. Haengwoo Lee, a famous biochemist conducted a clinical study on these two ingredients. The first is Seanol, an extremely rare seaweed extract  from Ecklonia Cava that's proven to be 100 times more powerful than any land-based antioxidant . That's because it stays working in your body for 12 hours, compared to land-based antioxidants that work for 30 minutes.  ""Its secret is its make-up of special chemicals that are a huge 40% fat soluble( ),"" Dr. Lee explains. ""Unlike nearly all land-based antioxidants that are water soluble, Seanol's protective compounds can get into things like the fatty tissues of your brain and penetrate  all three layers of your cells, including the outside, the oil-based cell membranes , and your DNA."" Indeed, Seanol is so powerful, it's the only FDA-approved Ecklonia Cava marine-algae    extract in existence.
The second ingredient is Calamarine, a deep-sea omega-3 discovery that delivers 85% more DHA omega-3s to your heart, brain, joints, and eyes. It's known to reduce the problems from tiredness and poor memory, joint pain, mood swings and depression.
With that research in mind, Dr. Lee combined Seanol and Calamarine with a high dose of vitamin D to form  Marine-D3, the newest supplement in the fight against age-related illnesses and high blood pressure.
Dr. Lee found that Calamarine delivers some of the greatest concentration of omega-3s known to science. Combined with Seanol's ability to reduce body inflammation , as well as help cells get the nutrients they need to thrive, stay healthy and protected, Marine-D3 is able to boost a body's entire well being.
The makers of Marine-D3 are so confident that you'll see fast dramatic results from this product, that if you aren't happy after two full months, simply return the unused portion and they'll buy it back. They'll even give you ten dollars extra just for giving it an honest try! That kind of faith, combined with Dr. Lee's exhaustive research, shows that Marine-D3 really is a one-of-a-kind product. 
 Question:What's the makers' attitude toward Marine-D3? 
A. pessimistic 
B. indifferent 
C. doubtful 
D. Optimistic

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. ""

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle?

Context: Today we find that school students hardly spend much time on sports. Is it because they aren't interested in sports? No, they often say they have other important things to do.
What are these important things? Tests! They have to spend much time on all kinds of tests at school. So many of them almost become bookworms  . Books stop them from going out for sports. Because of the _ from their parents and teachers, the students have to work harder and spend most of their time on books. As for the students, they want to get good results in order to improve their studies. So it is necessary for them to give all of their free time to their studies and stop their school sports.
In fact, education can't go without body exercise, because a quick mind hardly goes along with a weak  body. If you don't have a strong body, you can never get anything or any great success in your life. 
 Question:Which of the following is NOT TRUE? 
A. The students don't go out for sports because of their parents. 
B. Body exercise is very important for education. 
C. A person can't become successful with a weak body

Context: How do you like your school? Have you ever written to your headmaster to express your idea? Here are some letters written by students from different schools.
Luke, 14, from Jiangsu
I will give some suggestions about our school uniform. In our school, we students have to wear uniform every day. But the yellow and green sports kit looks really dark and old. It can't stand for young and lively spirit. We can add some red or orange colors and make a new type of uniform. I hope our headmaster will think about it.
Danny, 14, from Zhejiang
I have two suggestions for my headmaster. First of all, I think we should have more hobby classes in science , such as plane model making class and computer programming class. It is really boring to study basic subjects all the time. And second, I hope we can have more PE lessons or more time for physical exercise. Lots of students now don't have a strong enough body.
Sam, 15, from Shanxi
I'd like to say thank you to my headmaster. About one week ago, I got a bad cold after playing basketball. Our headmaster came to me after he knew about it. He took care of me until my parents came. I really want to thank him for that.
Helen, 14, from Shandong
In the letter I wrote, I want to talk about the possibility of personal classes. Now many middle schools are trying the ""personal class"" system. Students don't have regular classes. They can choose lessons they want to take. _ And it is also good for exercise. We don't have to stay in one classroom all the time. 
 Question:The reasons why Danny gives two suggestions are that   _  . 
A. students have too few classes every day and they love sports 
B. studying basic subjects only is boring and students are too weak 
C. hobby classes are interesting and students have no PE lessons at all

Context: Since ancient times, people have known about its ability to reduce pain and high body temperature. More than 2000 years ago, the Greek doctor Hippocrates advised his patients to chew on the bark and leaves of the willow.
The tree contains a chemical called salicin . From salicin, researchers in the 1800s discovered how to make salicylic acid . And in 1897, a chemist named Felix Hoffmann at Friedrich Bayer and Company in Germany created acetyl salicylic acid. Later it became the active substance in a new medicine that Bayer called aspirin. The ""a"" came from acetyl. The ""spir"" came from the spirea plant, which also produces salicin. And the ""in"" Well, that is a common way to end medicine names.
In 1982, a British scientist shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in part for discovering how aspirin works. Sir John Vane found that aspirin blocks the body from making natural substances called prostaglandins .Prostaglandins have several effects on the body. Some cause pain and the expansion, or swelling( ; ), of damaged tissue. Others protect the lining of the stomach and small intestine. Prostaglandins also make the heart, kidneys and blood vessels  work well. But there is a problem. Aspirin works against all prostaglandins, good and bad. Scientists learned how aspirin interferes with an enzyme . One form of this enzyme makes the prostaglandin that causes pain and swelling. Another form of the enzyme creates a protective effect. So aspirin can reduce pain and swelling in damaged tissues. But it can also harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine . 
 Question:What can we know about aspirin according to the passage? 
A. Aspirin can treat almost diseases. 
B. Aspirin can create the protective enzyme. 
C. Aspirin can harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
D. Aspirin can protect the inside of the stomach and small intestine.

Watching too much television may be bad for your eyes. This is not true for everyone. People with easily affected eyes may find they get red and achy   from watching TV for long. Carrots will help you see in the dark. Carrots are rich in beta-carotene (b). The body can change beta-carotene into vitamin A, and too little beta-carotene can cause night blindness. However, a lot of research shows that night blindness is more likely to be connected with some other vision problems.

A. wearing incorrect glasses 
B. watching TV for long 
C. too little beta-carotene 
D. too much vitamin A 
 Answer: C
Context: Sometimes successful health campaigns can have quite unexpected reactions. The years of warnings about skin cancer mean that Britons are happy to cover themselves in sunscreen or stay out of the sun altogether, but it also means that most of us are not getting enough vitamin D.
Scientists announced yesterday that Britons need to increase to three times the amount of vitamin D they get per day. They called on food producers to fortify their products with more of the vitamin and suggested people should consider taking supplements  to keep levels up. They also suggested getting out in the sun for short periods more often, but they warned against ""sun bingeing"".
The government does not publish official advice on the amount of vitamin D people should take due to a lack of research, says Dr Birgit Teucher of the Institute for Food Research. But in the US, the government recommends 5 micrograms a day. By that count, Dr Birgit Teucher said that around 90% of Britons between 19 and 64 would be lacking in the vitamin because they only took around 3 micrograms a day.
Vitamin D is important for absorption of calcium by the body, which is needed for healthy teeth and bones. A lack of it can lead to serious diseases in both children and adults. The vitamin can be found in some foods but it can also be obtained from chemicals in the skin reacting to sunlight. Dr Barbara Boucher said adults should get 5 to 25 micrograms a day. Shortage of vitamin D may be linked to diseases such as muscle weakness, high blood pressure and rickets .
Dr Birgit Teucher gave several reasons for the lack among Britons. Increasing numbers of office-based jobs mean a lack of exposure to the sun; and the rise of becoming overweight means that vitamin D--which is fat soluble is increasingly stored in body fat, where it cannot be accessed readily.
Professor Brian Wharton of the Institute of Child Health said that children in particular needed to have enough vitamin D to prevent rickets.
Professor Graham Bentham, an environmental scientist at the University of East Anglia, added that babies who were only breast-fed probably need to take supplements in case their mother was vitamin D lacking. Those drinking milk were likely to be OK, thanks to the fortification of the drink.
The scientists called on food producers to fortify milk, bread and breakfast nutrient to enable people to get their daily amount of the vitamin. Prof Graham Bentham added that 30 minutes of sun exposure to the face and forearms between April and October would be _ . Outside these months, the sun is not strong enough in Britain for the body to produce its own vitamin D.
But Prof Graham Bentham warned against spending too long in the sun. ""Sun bingeing is well known to be dangerous,"" he said. ""In any case, vitamin D transformation in the skin switches off after a while so short frequent amounts are better for vitamin D formation.""

Context: Darek Fidyka, a 38-year-old Bulgarian, had been paralyzed   from the chest down for four years after a knife attack. Scientists from Britain and Poland took cells from his nose, transplanted   them into his back and re-grew his spinal cord  . Now he can walk and even drive a car. The doctors were delighted but said it was the first step in a long journey.
The breakthrough came after 40 years of research by Professor Geoff Raisman, who found that cells had the possibility to repair damage to nasal   nerves, the only part of the nervous system that constantly re-grows. ""The idea was to take something from an area where the nervous system can repair itself and put it into an area that doesn't repair itself,"" Professor Raisman said.
Polish doctors injected   the nasal cells into Mr Fidyka's spinal cord above the injury and used some nerves from his ankle to form a bridge across the damaged tissue. The nasal cells appear to have caused the spinal nerves to repair themselves.
Professor Raisman achieved this with rats in the late 1990's, but this is his greatest success. ""I think the moment of discovery for me was Christmas in 1997 when I first saw a rat, which couldn't control its hand, put its hand out to me. That was an exciting moment, because I realized then that my belief that the nervous system could be repaired was true.""
Doctors chose the easiest case for their first attempt--it might not work for others. But there is a real sense of hope that an idea once thought impossible has been realized.
David Nicholls, who helped provide money for the breakthrough, said information about the breakthrough would be made available to researchers across the globe.
""What you've got to understand is that for three million paralyzed people in the world today, the world looks a totally brighter place than it did yesterday,"" he said. 
 Question:What made Professor Geoff Raisman begin to believe the nervous system can be repaired? 
A. His former study with other people. 
B. His operation on a paralyzed patient. 
C. His sudden thought about Christmas. 
D. His unusual experience with a sick rat.

Context: A heartless thief is believed to have crashed a fund-raiser and made off with a bag of cash meant to help a New York City firefighter pay for life-changing surgery for his 9-year-old son. But little Aidan Sullivan -- who was born with a facial defect and no right ear -- yesterday put up a brave front, with a message for the crook(thief): ""I'm going to kick your butt!""
""I want to look normal,"" said Aidan, whose father, Tim, is a firefighter in the Bronx. The third-grader has hemi facial micro soma, in which one half of the face doesn't develop correctly.
Last weekend, family friend Peter Drake, a Ridgefield, Conn., firefighter, hosted a fund-raiser, collecting between $8,000 and $9,000. But when the party at a Danbury, Conn., Irish cultural center was over, the money had disappeared.
""At the end of the night, all the money that was donated was put in a zippered bag,"" said Tim Sullivan. ""A bartender gave the bag to Pete... He had it in his hands. He put it down to go do something, and when he came back, he saw that it was missing.""
Sullivan said his longtime friend -- who has had fund-raisers to pay for Aidan's 10 previous surgeries -- is ""devastated.""
""Pete was so upset. He kept saying, 'I let Aidan down, I let Aidan down,"" Colleen Sullivan, 40, recalled.
""We even went Dumpster diving, in case it was thrown out.""
The Sullivans plan to go ahead with the March 1 surgery led by specialists at NYU's Langone Medical Center in Manhattan. The money would have offset the $10,000 to $15,000 that insurance doesn't cover. Yesterday, Aidan said he's not a fan of hospitals and doesn't like to be away from his sister, Kaylee, 4. But he's willing to do it. ""I'm excited,"" he said. ""Finally, an ear.""

Context: One baby born with a defective windpipe   now has hope of breathing normally thanks to 3-D printing technology, NPR reported.
Garrett Peterson, now 18 months old, was born with tracheomalacia  , leaving him unable to breathe. The condition terrified his parents, who turned to specialist Dr. Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment.
Along with Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer who runs the university's 3-D printing lab, Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett's windpipe until it's strong enough to function independently. After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the ""splint"" with a 3-D printer.
""It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,"" Green told NPR.
On January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs?
Though he still remains in the hospital, Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery.  His parents are overjoyed, saying he's starting to act more interactive and alert.
As Garrett grows, the splint will expand and eventually dissolve in his body as his own windpipe strengthens enough to work independently.
3-D printing technology has allowed doctors to help patients in ways that they hope will continue to grow.
""We're talking about taking something like dust and converting it into body parts,"" Green said. ""And we're able to do things that were never possible before."" 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that   _  . 
A. Garrett is out of hospital with the help of 3-D printing technology. 
B. The splint will exist in Garrett's body for ever. 
C. It is difficult to operate the 3-D printer. 
D. Garrett's condition is critical.

Context: I was in my first year of college, making friends and enjoying life, but then my whole world turned upside down. I had a heart attack. It felt like someone was stabbing   me in the chest with a knife over and over again.
After three months of rest I went back to college, but then things took a turn for the worse. I was staying at my Nana's house and woke up in the middle of the night with a terrible pain in my chest. I knew I was having a heart attack again.
I couldn't even shout for help. Luckily my grandpa was going to the toilet and heard me falling out of bed. If it wasn't for him, I probably wouldn't be here.
The two holes in my heart were causing the problems and I needed an operation immediately to repair them. Unfortunately, the surgery didn't go well and they only managed to repair one of the holes.
When I woke up from the operation, I had a really dry mouth and couldn't wait to have something to eat and drink. The biggest shock of all came when I was told that I needed a heart transplant and was put on the register. The doctors were stunned at how quickly heart failure came on - it usually takes years, but it took my heart less than six months to get to that stage. My whole world came crashing down, but I stayed strong. It was a choice between crying every day and getting on with my life.
As time went on, life became even harder. I hated feeling weak all the time and needing help with everything. It got to the point where I thought I would never get a new heart. I was diagnosed with depression.
Even though I thought that Christmas 2008 would be my last, I really enjoyed it and even had a good New Year. Everyone was crying for me when the clock struck midnight and they told me to keep fighting.
A week later, I got a call from the doctors saying they'd found a suitable donor  . My wish came true and thankfully the operation went well. I spent four hours in surgery where they took out my old heart and put a new one in. When I woke up I burst out crying. I had a second chance at life. 
 Question:When the author learned that he needed a heart transplant, he   _  . 
A. couldn't help crying every day 
B. chose to continue to fight for his life 
C. felt so depressed that he tried to kill himself 
D. was so anxious that his heart failure developed very quickly 
 Answer: B
Context: ""Oh please God, no, no!"" Stephen Eldredge cried out when he saw his wife, Shelli, badly wounded on the side of the road. She had broken actually every long bone in her body, along with her pelvis, jaw, and cheekbones. He was terrified his bride would bleed to death.
Stephen and Shelli had married just six months before near their home in South Jordan, Utah. They were in Hawaii on a family vacation with two of their sons. The family had rented electric motors and headed towards a nature preserve near Waikiki. But Shelli had fallen behind and the family turned back to make sure she was okay.
Shelli lost so much blood that her heart couldn't function properly and she went into shock at the hospital. Physicians were able to make her come to herself. On the first and second days there, she lived through half a dozen operations. On day three, the worst of Stephen's fears came true. Shelli didn't wake. She had shown heart failure and lung failure. ""I thought every heartbeat would be her last,"" Stephen says.
As days passed with no change, one doctor gently asked if it was time to let Shelli go. An MRI showed her brain didn't have much chance of supporting life. Stephen couldn't bear the thought of trapping his wife's beautiful spirit in a body that would never work. If he kept her alive, what kind of life would she have ? He called family, religious leaders, and physician friends in Utah for guidance.
And he decided there still was a chance.
The family moved Shelli to a Utah hospital closer to home. In the next few weeks she started opening her eyes, but it wasn't entirely clear how conscious she was. Nearly seven weeks after the accident, Stephen was joking with his sister in the hospital room when he saw Shelli smile, a big toothy grin. ""Did you understand that?"" he asked. She smiled again. Stephen fell to his knees in thanks.
Shelli's recovery has been slow but steady. Initially, she couldn't remember much of the previous months, including her own wedding. Shelli has endured 17 operations so far and may require more surgery. She will definitely need more months of recovery. But she is able to walk. ""She's got her life back. She's able to love and be loved, and be the person she was."" Elovie says.
When Shelli hears about each step in her recovery, she calls it ""miracle after miracle"". As for his experience, Stephen says, ""This is a story of fear that was slowly replaced by faith."" 
 Question:In the hospital room Shelli smiled for the first time after the accident because  _  . 
A. she liked people telling jokes. 
B. she had remembered all that had happened 
C. she was excited that she got her life back 
D. she understood the joke being talked about

Context: Do you know you could get sick just by walking past a building? The bacteria  that cause Legionnaire's disease grow very fast in large modern buildings. They are carried by air through the buildings and outside. Legionnaire s disease is only one of the illnesses that are caused by ""sick buildings"".
Some buildings can make you ill because their heating and air-conditioning  are controlled . Air from outside cannot get in through the closed windows; This indoor air pollution is a growing problem.
Legionnaire's disease may be the most serious result of sick buildings, but other unpleasant illnesses can appear.People who work in some buildings suffer  from tiredness, feeling sick and headaches. Their offices look bright and clean, but invisible  and dangerous bacteria are in the air around them.
There is an answer to the problem. The air-conditioning and heating can be tested for bacteria. _ This is expensive to do, but the results are good. The people in the buildings no longer get sick, and everybody is happier. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE? 
A. Legionnaire's disease is only one of the results of ""sick buildings"".

Context: The H1Nl virus has been spreading world-wide,it is important for us to know how to control it.Please pay attention to the following points:
1.Don't touch your face.Above all,keep your hands away from your eyes,mouth and nose,all of which serve pathways  for the viruses  to enter your body.
2.Wash your hands.If you have to touch your face,wash your hands,getting under the fingernails for 20 to 30 seconds with hot soap and water before.Soaps with surfactants  can deal with flu viruses.
3.Cover your nose and mouth.When someone sneezes or coughs,liquid  drops with flu viruses as far as three feet through the air and land on your nose and mouth,so it's best to keep at least an arm's length distance when talking to someone who shows signs of infection .In order to protect others,cover your mouth and nose with a tissue  when you cough or sneeze,and clean your hands afterward.Viruses can live for hours,or even longer when on the skin or other surfaces such as keyboards.
4.Consider buying a mask in case you need it in the future.Some research suggests that masks reduce the risk of getting the flu viruses by as much as 80%.But it also suggests that if you don't wash hands,the mask doesn't work well.So wash your hands and use the mask,especially wearing face masks in crowded places is also useful.

Context: Recently I went to the Tsavo National Park in northern Kenya for a film. We set off early for a distant water hole. A huge elephant,covered with dry mud,drank calmly and deeply. He might have traveled 50 km to reach the water. He wasn-t going to hurry now. He-d drink a while and then rest in the shade, and then drink again-or so we thought. What actually happened was that he drank deeply and stepped away. Then he suddenly fell down. Within minutes he was dead.
We called animal doctor Jeremiah Poghon immediately. He removed the head of a poisoned arrow from the eLephant s body,and let out over 100 litters of pus  -the result of the elephants meeting with a poacher months before.
Today's poacher shoots from a blind. He fires an arrow,covered with poison,into the body of an elephant. If the poacher is lucky,the elephant might die in an hour or two; if not,he might have to follow the elephant for days before it dies. Often the arrow head fails to kill the elephant at once-it doesn't mean the poison won't finally kill the elephant,but it will be a slow death. Living in Tsavo through these times,l could see the results of poaching from time to time.
When I think about the death of that elephant,what stays with me is the extraordinary silence after the shocking sound of his body hitting the ground. I took some comfort from the knowledge that as the dead body returned to the soil,some animals would benefit-but I couldn't escape the feeling that with the death of such a large animal,the world seemed a poorer and emptier place. 
 Question:Further examination showed that the dead e!ephant_. 
A. had suffered a lot 
B. had wounds all over it 
C. had drunk some deadly water 
D. had had a good fight with a poacher

Context: Wherever she goes, Molly leaves her mark. Without saying a word, she speaks to people with her kind eyes. Even when she walks away, she leaves an impression.Molly's mark is a smile, stamped into the ground by the horseshoe at the bottom of her false leg.
A few years ago, Molly was badly attacked by a dog.The dog bit all four of Molly's legs and left large cuts in her face. Molly's owner, Kate Harris, took her to an animal hospital.Doctors there were able to save Molly's life, but soon one of her legs became very infected .
At first, doctors thought Molly would have to be put to sleep.But Molly changed their minds. This pony, doctors noticed, shifted her weight, and rested her good leg from time to time. Doctors knew that Molly had amazing intelligence, and that she wanted to live.
Several doctors operated on Molly, and removed her infected leg. A false leg was made for her. The leg was a hollow cast with a pole at the bottom for balance. Doctors gave Molly a special horseshoe at the bottom of the leg. This horseshoe she had had a stamp of a smile face in it!
After the operation, Molly walked around on all four legs, as if nothing had ever happened to her! Now, with every step she takes, she stamps a smile in the dirt.But she leaves her m ark in other ways, too.
Kaye Harris took Molly to the false leg center. There were children there who, like Molly, had artificial arms or legs. They were amazed to see a pony with a false leg. Molly made them smile and gave them hope. Soon, Molly began to visit schools, nursing homes, army bases and hospitals. A book was even written about Molly!

Context: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog.
Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation.
""The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,"" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery.
The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are ""extremely difficult, if not impossible"" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said.
The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face.
The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants,
Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue.
Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality
There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers.
Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant. 
 Question:The best title for the passage would be   _  . 
A. French Woman has First Partial Face Transplant 
B. First Face Transplant Opens Debate 
C. Risks and Ethical Problems of a Face Transplant 
D. A Complete Face Transplant of a French Woman

Context: Recently hand-foot-mouth disease has spread across China. In the past three months, there have been about 41,846 cases   in 30 provinces and regions. The number is increasing. Eighteen Chinese children have died of the disease so far this year.
What causes the disease and why is it dangerous?
Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common childhood illness. It mainly affects children under the age of 10. It gets its name from the rash   that develops on the hands and feet. It can also cause blisters   in your mouth.
A child who has the disease will usually have a fever, a runny nose and sore throat. He or she doesn't want to eat or drink because of pain in the mouth.
Hand-foot-mouth disease is mostly not serious. The fever and rash clear within a few days. But in some cases, the virus   affects the heart, lungs or brain. This puts the child's life in danger.
A virus causes hand-foot-mouth disease. The disease spreads easily where a lot of young children are together, such as in a child-care center. Sometimes it can also affect teenagers and adults.
In order not to pass on the virus, good hygiene   is important. We should wash our hands as often as possible. Especially we should wash our hands before meals and after going to the toilet. 
 Question:_   can help us to keep away from the hand-foot-mouth disease. 
A. Passing on the virus 
B. Taking children to the child-care center 
C. Keeping your hands clean 
D. Not going to public places

Context: TOKYO -- The number of domestic infections cases of influenza A/H1N1 in Japan hits 42 on Sunday after a total of 34 people in Osaka and Hyogo counties were confirmed to have been infected, local media reported.
The total number of the infection in the country now stands at 46, including the first four cases contracted abroad.
The country is now facing the risk of grass-root outbreak which could lead the WHO to raise its new flu pandemic alert to the highest level of 6 from the current 5, experts has warned.
The 34 newly confirmed domestic cases, 11 in Osaka and 23 in Hyogo, included high school students, college students and teachers, the health ministry and local governments said Sunday.
Japan on Saturday confirmed the first eight cases of domestic infection on students of a Kobe high school. The later confirmed cases in Osaka are said to have contacted the Kobe students in a volleyball match. Osaka and Hyogo are neighboring in the Kansai region.
All of the 42 people had no record of overseas travel.
Meanwhile, a total of 143 students at the Kansai Okura Senior High School where many infections in Osaka were found, have shown symptoms of influenza since around Monday, according to local media reports.
The privately run school said it will be closed from Monday through Saturday.
More than 1,000 educational facilities -- kindergartens, and elementary, junior and senior high schools -- in Osaka and Hyogo counties have decided to suspend classes for certain periods following the confirmation of new flu infections in the counties, Kyodo News reported.
The two counties have requested private schools to follow suit.
Osaka Governor Toru Hashimoto held a meeting of a new flu task force on Sunday and decided to ask facilities such as movie theaters to suspend operations to prevent the spread of the flu.
TV clips showed people in Kansai region started to wear masks in public spaces and rushed to drug stores for buying medicines.
The Japanese government on Saturday shifted the stage of its new-flu action program from ""a period of overseas outbreak"" to ""a period of domestic outbreak"" and called for companies and schools in the areas concerned to allow individuals to avoid commuting  during rush hours.
The Kyodo News quoted Masato Tashiro, a member of the World Health Organization's emergency committee, as saying that several hundred people in Japan already may have been infected with the new flu. 
 Question:Which of the following is one of the measures already taken by the Japanese government? 
A. Raising the new flu pandemic alert to the highest level. 
B. Holding a meeting to ask some facilities in the country to stop their operations. 
C. Calling for individuals in the whole country to avoid commuting during rush hours.

Context: While sweet treats can be hard to resist, the World Health Organization(WHO) has set new guidelines for people around the world. The guidelines, released on Wednesday, advise that both adults and children cut back on their sugar intake  to stay healthy.
In a statement, Francesco Branca, director of the WHO's nutrition department, said there is evidence that reducing daily sugar intake reduces the risk of being overweight and tooth decay .
The guidelines do not apply to the sugars in fresh fruit and vegetables or those that are naturally present in milk. According to the WHO, there is no reported evidence of negative effects of consuming those sugars. Instead, the new guidelines focus on ""added"" or ""free"" sugars. These include sugars that are added to processed foods and drinks such as candy and soft drinks.
Added sugars are sometimes described as "" hidden"" sugars because they exist in foods we might not think of as sweets, such as honey and ketchup . Health experts advise that consumers look at ingredients on food packages to help make better-informed decisions.
The WHO recommends that people in the United States, Europe and other Western societies should cut their average sugar intake by about two-thirds, or down to just 10% of their overall calories. For developing countries, where dental care is less advanced, the WHO recommends that sugar intake be reduced to 5%.
Scientist Kieran Clarke, of the University of Oxford, notes that for those people who can't shake their love for sweets, getting more exercise is a good solution. ""If you get enough exercise, you can eat almost anything,"" she said ""But it's very hard to avoid large amounts of sugar unless all you're eating is fruit and vegetables."" 
 Question:We can learn from the text that   _  . 
A. added sugar isn't marked on food packages 
B. we should drink as little milk as possible as it contains sugar 
C. soft drinks don't contain added sugar 
D. the less exercise you do, the fewer sweet things you should eat

Context: Plants need green leaves to make food. A plant needs sunlight and carbon dioxide  from the air for making food and it also needs water and salts from the soil to make food too. There are certain cells   in the leaves which change carbon dioxide and water into sugar. To do this the cells needs energy, which they get from the sunlight.
Green leaves make food for the whole plant. A red leaf can make food too because under the red color1ing of the leaf there are food----making cells. There are no leaves which are completely yellow, for they can't make food.
The plant makes sugar for its food. In sunlight green leaves make a lot of sugar. The veins   can't carry all this sugar away, so the leaves change the sugar into starch  , which is kept and so stored in the leaves. At night, the starch changes back to sugar. It is then carried away from the leaves. Some of the sugar is used as food by the plant while the rest is stored as starch. In some plants, food is stored in the roots, in others it is stored in the stem   and in leaves, fruits and seeds. 
 Question:Sugar is made for its food by   _  . 
A. sunlight 
B. veins 
C. stems 
D. green leaves

Context: We discuss the issue of when to help a patient die. Doctors of our generation are not newcomers to this question. Going back to my internship days, I can remember many patients in pain, sometimes in coma , with late, hopeless cancer. For many of them, we wrote an order for heavy medication--morphine by the clock. This was not talked about openly and little was written about it. It was essential, not controversial.
The best way to bring the problem into focus is to describe two patients whom I cared for. The first, formerly a nurse, had an automobile accident. A few days later her lungs seemed to fill up; her heart developed dangerous rhythm disturbances. So there she was: in coma, on a breathing machine, her heartbeat maintained with an electrical device. One day after rounds, my secretary said the husband and son of the patient wanted to see me. They told me their wife and mother was obviously going to die; she was a nurse and had told her family that she never wanted this kind of terrible death, being maintained by machines. I told them that while I respected their view, there was nothing deadly about her situation. The kidney  failure she had was just the kind for which the artificial kidney was most effective. While possibly a bit reassured, they were disappointed. Here was the head surgeon seemingly determined to keep everybody alive, no matter what.
Within a few days the patient's pacemaker  could be removed and she awoke from her coma. About six months later, the door of my office opened and in walked a gloriously fit woman. After some cheery words of appreciation, the father and son asked to speak to me alone. As soon as the door closed, both men became quite tearful. All that came out was, ""We want you to know how wrong we were.""
The second patient was an 85-year-old lady whose hair caught fire while she was smoking. She arrived with a deep burn; I knew it would surely be deadly. As a remarkable coincidence there was a meeting for discussion going on at the time in medical ethics . The speaker asked me if I had any sort of ethical problem I could bring up for discussion. I described the case and asked the students their opinion. After the discussion, I made a remark that was, when looking back, a serious mistake. I said, ""I'll take the word back to the nurses about her and we will talk about it some more before we decide."" The instructor and the students were shocked: ""You mean this is a real patient?"" The teacher of ethics was not accustomed to being challenged by actuality. In any event, I went back and met with the nurses. A day or two later, when she was making no progress and was suffering terribly, we began to back off treatment. Soon she died quietly and not in pain. As a reasonable physician, you had better move ahead and do what you would want done for you. And don't discuss it with the world first. There is a lesson here for everybody. Assisting people to leave this life requires strong judgment and long experience to avoid its misuse. 
 Question:The author suggested that doctors  _   before they assist a patient in killing himself. 
A. do what they are wanted to do 
B. discuss with the others about the decision first 
C. be required to do so first by the patient 
D. make sure there is no other choice left

Context: Book into the new prefix = st1 /AucklandHospitalat a typical hour, say 11 on a Saturday night, and you will notice changes in the way you are treated.
Let's start with the blood sample taken from your arm as you are wheeled in the door. 
By the time you are through the security doors and into the emergency area, that sample could have been sent through to the lab by vacuum tube and analysed by a machine which automatically feeds a preparative result into the clinical database. 
Less than a minute after the sample is processed, the doctors can see the results through the monitors beside every position in the emergency suites. 
As you are being wheeled in, you may notice cameras in the ceiling. The hospital has spent $4 million on its camera security system to protect staff and patients. 
When you come to in the neighbouring Admission and Planning Unit, the clinician  may be looking at all your records, x-rays and even documents sent in by your GP on a Compaq tablet PC wirelessly connected to the network by an 802.11 ""WiFi"" card. 
It's not ideal for viewing images, but it should be good enough for a bedside consultation . 
If the clinician needs to consult a specialist or your GP, the other party can see the same records from home or office through a secure internet connection.

Context: A blocked airway  can kill someone in three to four minutes, but it can take more than eight minutes for an ambulance to arrive. So a simple procedure such as opening someone's airway can save their life while they're waiting for emergency medical help. This means you're more likely to give first aid to someone you know than a stranger.
There are many misconceptions  surrounding first aid. Below are the 'most popular' ones with details of what you should do.
You should put butter or cream on a burn. The only thing you should put on a burn is cold water - keep the butter for cooking. Put the affected area under cold running water for at least ten minutes.
The best way to treat bleeding is to put the wound under a tap. If you put a bleeding wound under a tap you wash away the body's clotting agents  and make it bleed more. Instead put pressure on the wound with whatever is available to stop or slow down the flow of blood. As soon as possible call 999. Keep pressure on the wound until help arrives.
Nosebleeds are best treated by putting the head back. If you put the head back during a nosebleed, all the blood goes down the back of the airway. Instead advise them to tilt  their head forwards and ask the person to pinch  the end of their nose and breathe through their mouth.
You need lots of training to do first aid. You don't - what you mostly need is common sense. You can learn enough first aid in a few minutes to save someone's life - whether it's from a book, attending a course or watching videos online.
Remember: anyone can save a life

Context: Australian scientists say an organic compound  used by Indian women to paint dots or bindi on their foreheads could hold the key to a breakthrough in cancer treatment. Rose Bengal was first used in the early 1900s as a dye for food, textiles and cosmetics. But now it is proving to be a useful weapon in the fight against skin cancer.
Television advertisements constantly warn of the dangers of overexposure to the fierce sun. Among them is the possibility of the disease melanoma , a type of skin cancer. More than 1,200 Australians die every year from the disease.
Initial trials of a solution of Rose Bengal injected into some melanoma cells have had a 75 percent success rate in controlling the disease. Professor John Thompson, the director of the Melanoma Unit at the University of Sydney, says this organic dye could become a powerful cancer-fighting treatment.
""We believe it works by getting into the tumor  cells and causing them to self-destruct. But the exact mechanism by which it works is not totally clear. It's not useful for people who have a primary melanoma. The treatment of primary melanoma is surgical excision ,""he said. ""It's useful to inject tumors for people who have recurrences; when the primary treatment has failed and when recurrence in the area, or at more distant sites has occurred.""
About 90 percent of Australians who develop melanoma survive thanks to early diagnosis and treatment. If left untreated, however, the disease can be fatal.
Convincing younger people in Australia about the dangers of overexposure to the sun is a battle campaigners are constantly waging.
Veronica Manock, a 21-year-old student, had two major operations to remove a cancerous tumor from her leg.
""I've had a lot of friends who just said 'I thought it was just, you know, I'll get a mole  cut out and that's it', whereas I don't think people realize how much danger they're putting themselves into and how easy it is to stop something like this happening to you just from doing little things,""said Marock.
Other researchers in Australia are investigating genetic treatments to skin cancer. There is a pressing need for such research to produce effective treatments. Australians, the majority of whom are fair-skinned , are four times more likely to develop a melanoma than people in Canada, the United States or Great Britain.

Context: Many people have never heard of Mesothelioma and are unaware of its symptoms. Although considered a rare form of cancer, each year the number of cases grows. With the prevalence of this disease on the rise, it is critical to understand why and how Mesothelioma develops and what courses of action can be taken in the event of diagnosis. The following is a list of frequently asked questions and answers that will provide you with some information on Mesothelioma, and the legal issues surrounding it.
What is Mesothelioma?
Mesothelioma is the term used to describe a cancerous tumor found in the mesothelial cells of an organ. The organs where this form of cancer is most commonly found are the lungs, heart and abdominal organs. Pleural Mesothelioma is cancer of the lung lining(,)and is the most common form of Mesothelioma.
What causes Mesothelioma?
Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos . Asbestos is often found in building materials used before the mid 1970's. In addition, materials such as pipes, boiler insulation, floor, ceiling and roof tiles may contain asbestos.
How much asbestos exposure will cause Mesothelioma?
Generally, the probability of developing this form of cancer is in accordance with the length of time you are exposed to asbestos. Also, your health is at risk if your exposure to asbestos is intense. It should be noted that Mesothelioma has a latency period of 20 to 50 years. This means that you may develop the disease long after your exposure to asbestos. On average, people tend to develop Mesothelioma somewhere between 35 and 40 years after exposure.
How quickly does Mesothelioma progress?
The onset of Mesothelioma is quite slow. Patients will begin to experience symptoms such as lower back pain and chest pain. These symptoms may also be accompanied by weight loss, fever and difficulty breathing. Unfortunately, once Mesothelioma develops, it quickly becomes aggressive and treatment must be sought immediately.
Can Mesothelioma be treated?
Doctors are able to use several traditional methods of cancer treatment for Mesothelioma, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Like all forms of cancer, detecting the disease at the earliest stage possible greatly increases the patient's chances for survival. If you have worked in an industry such as construction or suspect that you may have been exposed to asbestos, be alert for symptoms and contact your doctor immediately.
What legal courses of action can be taken?
Anyone suffering from Mesothelioma is entitled to compensation from asbestos manufacturers. Additionally, if you are the spouse or child of someone who has died from Mesothelioma, you are entitled to file a claim and seek compensation. 
 Question:We can learn from the text that   _  . 
A. Asbestos is to blame for Mesothelioma. 
B. Even if a person is exposed to asbestos for a while, he will die soon. 
C. All the employees can ask for compensation from asbestos manufacturers. 
D. Mesothelioma is a cancer familiar to many people.

 Answer: C
Context: One Sunday, my family had gathered at my parents' house to feast upon Mom's wonderful cooking. During the normal dinner chatter  , I noticed that my father was slurring   his words. No one mentioned this during dinner, but I felt compelled to discuss it with my mother afterward.
We decided that there was something seriously wrong and that Dad needed to see the doctor.
Mom phoned me two days later. ""The doctor found a brain tumor  . It's too large at this point to operate. Maybe they can do something then, but _ .""
Even with the treatment, my father's condition worsened, and the doctor finally informed us that this condition was terminal  . During one of his stays in the hospital, we brought our baby daughter Chelsey with us when we visited him. By this time he had great difficulty speaking. I finally figured out that he wanted Chelsey to sit on his stomach so he could make faces at her.
Watching the two of them together, I realized I was living an experience that would stay with me forever. Though grateful for the times they could share, I couldn't shake the feeling of a clock ticking in the background.
On the visit to my parents' home during what we all know was my father's last days, my mother took Chelsey from my arms and announced, ""Your father would like to see you alone for a minute.""
I entered the bedroom where my father lay on a rented hospital bed. He appeared even weaker than the day before.
""How are you feeling, Dad?"" I asked. ""Can I do anything for you?""
He tried to speak, but he couldn't make out a word.
""I'm sorry, but I can't understand you,"" I said.
With great difficulty he said, ""I love you.""
We don't learn courage from heroes on the evening news. We learn true courage from watching ordinary people rise above hopeless situations. In many ways my father was a strict, uncommunicative man. He found it difficult to show emotion. The bravest thing I ever saw him do was overcome that barrier to open his heart to his son and family at the end of his life. 
 Question:The father had never said ""I love you"" to the writer before because   _  . 
A. he believed in strictness and punishment 
B. he was not so attached to the writer 
C. he thought there was no need to tell the writer 
D. he was not used to openly showing his emotions

 Answer: D
Context: Bea, a five-year-old girl, was born with a severe illness which means she has to be kept away from other children of her age, because her body is so weak that she would be unable to fight off a common cold.
Bea was diagnosed with this disease when she was five months old. Since then, the hospital has become her second home, medicines for food, and all kinds of treatments her friends. Bea received a very special treatment when she was four years old, which would allow her to be like a normal child if successful. After that, she spent two weeks in ICU before living for four months on a separate ward . Bea was allowed home in February but still needed a special tube in her nose to send in medicines every two days.
Her parents clean the house from top to bottom every two days and hoover each morning to make sure Bea is free from any possible bacteria. Anna, Bea's mother, said, ""she is weak but so strong. We've never seen any child stronger than her. It seems as if nothing in the world could beat her. We really hope to send her to school next year."" She used to drive on the local playground, but Bea was only allowed to watch sitting in the car. ""It was heartbreaking to see Bea staring at the running and laughing children there. She never stopped fighting the disease. I know she's dying for such a normal life.""
Hearing of Bea's story, the Make-A-Wish Foundation has paid for a play park to be built in her back garden. ""Bea is very brave and she has encouraged many children like her,"" said the chairman of the foundation. 
 Question:If Bea stayed with other children freely,_. 
A. other children would have a higher chance to catch her disease 
B. she would catch a common cold which would kill her quickly 
C. her life would be in great danger as she could fall ill easily 
D. she would be lost in playing and forget to receive treatment 
 Answer: C
Context: Most children have ever heard their parents yell ""sit up straight!"" or ""don't hang your head !"" when they eat dinner. Nowadays, it is also heard around another activity -- video games. Ten-year-old Owaish admits it takes him three to four hours a day to play games on his tablet computer. In addition, he plays for about two hours on the smart phone every day. As a result, he started suffering a serious pain in the neck around June or July. What's worse the pain has spread to the hand and back gradually, which makes his mother Mehzabin become concerned.
The doctors note the number of young children with the chronic pain  in their necks, arms and shoulders is on the increase sharp in recent years . They are not aging, they haven't had an accident, the blood reports are fine, their X-rays are fine, and their MRIs are fine. Facts have proved that the pain is from the poor posture  while they are playing video games on smart phones or other electronic devices. 19-year -old student Nida feels pain in the finger which holds the weight of her smart phone most of the day. Nida almost uses her smart phone 24/7, which means 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or all the time.
Health experts predict there will be not only physical but mental  problems resulting from the overuse of electronic devices. They encourage people to often take breaks and exercise from using computers, smart phones or other devices. Stand up! Stretch  the legs, back, shoulders and arms in all the possible directions. That's the most effective way and maybe the key to solving the problem completely. After all, the medication doesn't help sometimes.

Context: Scientists have recently discovered that mothers tend to hold their baby on the left.Of 255 right-handed mothers,83% held the baby on the left.And out of 32 left-handed women,78%held the baby on the left As a control( ),women were watched coming from supermarkets carrying baby-sized bags;the bags were held with no side preference.
Then,dental   patients were given a large rubber ball to hold during treatment.The majority held the ball to their left side,even when it was interrupted with the dentist's activities.
This suggested that in times of stress objects are held against the left side.
At that point,something clearly contrary was observed.A large number of mothers who brought their premature babies to a clinic were seen to hold their babies against their right side.
So,115 mothers who had been separated from their babies for 24 hours after birth were observed for holding response.The experimenters presented the baby directly to midline of the mother's body, and noted how she held the baby.53% placed the baby on the left and 47% on the right.And it was also noted that the mothers of the group who had held their baby on the left had already had a baby from which they had not been separated after birth.
Left-handed holding enables the baby to hear the heartbeat.In order to discover whether hearing the heart has a beneficial effect on the baby,the sound of a human heart-beat was played to 102 babies in a New York nursery for 4 days.A control group of babies was not exposed to heart-beats.The babies in the heart-beat group gained more weight and cried far less than the babies in the control group. 
 Question:The experiments proved that_. 
A. mothers have an instinct to hold their babies on the left immediately after birth 
B. mothers hold their babies on the left in times of stress 
C. mothers of premature babies do not have the instinct to hold their babies on the left 
D. mothers find it more comfortable to carry their babies on the left because the heart is on that side 
 Answer: C
Context: Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do. 
 Question:Ray Birdwhistell believes that physical appearance   _  . 
A. has little to do with culture 
B. has much to do with culture 
C. is ever changing 
D. is different from place to place 
 Answer: B
Context: Do you have back pain or difficulty with your eyesight? If you do, you are likely to have a problem of posture, which can be solved if you ask a help from a doctor promptly. The conference on posture held in Rome this year has brought out the fact that an Italian out of four have posture problems. Back pain is certainly the typical disease deriving from a wrong posture, which can also cause other problems: sight problems, for example, which affect above all children.
You might think that women are most affected by these problems, as they are more used to following the trends of fashion, which imposes the use of heavy bags, flat pumps or high-heeled shoes, but the latest conference of the Italian Society of Orthopedics and Traumatology has brought out the fact that men also have bad behavior. About two millions Italian men suffer from backache. Besides wrong shoes and the habits of keeping the wallet in the back pocket for a long time, hi-tech products can cause some serious problems: laptops, iPads, smartphones...all these electronic products together can weigh up to 5 kilos, while the maximum weigh to carry on shoulders should be 3 kilos. The handiness of modern netbooks can have negative consequences, as you can use them when you are lying down. However, it would be better to use them while seated, keeping your back straight and your shoulders relaxed.
If you do not disregard the problem and you intervene in it in time, you can start having a right posture, perhaps doing posture correction exercises and more sport. A global posture re-education , a healthier lifestyle and a series of little devices might solve your back problems. 
 Question:According to the writer the posture problems happen_. 
A. only in Italy 
B. simply in Rome 
C. in the whole world 
D. just in China 
 Answer: C
Context: When a first-time father saw his newborn son, he immediately noticed the baby's ears obviously standing out from his head. He expressed his concern to the nurse that some children might be made fun of his child. A doctor examined the baby and reassured the new dad that his son was healthy---- the ears presented only a small problem with its appearance.
But the nervous father continued. He wondered if the child might suffer psychological effects of ridicule, or if they should consider plastic surgery . The nurse assured him that it was really no problem, and he should just wait to see if the boy grows into his ears.
The father finally felt more optimistic about his child, but now he worried about his wife's reaction to those large ears. She had been delivered by operation, and had not yet seen the child.
""She doesn't take things as easily as I do,"" he said to the nurse.
By this time, the new mother was settled in the recovery room and ready to meet her new baby. The nurse went along with the dad to lend some support in case this inexperienced mother became upset about her baby's large ears.
The baby was in a blanket  with his head covered for the short trip through the cold air-conditioned corridor. The baby was placed in his mother's arms, who eased the blanket back so that she could look at her child for the first time.
She took one look at her baby's face and looked to her husband and gasped, ""Oh, Honey! Look! He has your ears!""
No problem with Mom. She married those ears...and she loves the man to whom _ are attached.
The poet Kahlil Gibran said, ""Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart."" It's hard to see the ears when you're looking into the light. 
 Question:What is true about the baby's mother? 
A. She blamed her husband for the baby's big ears. 
B. She was the first to discover the baby's large ears. 
C. She suggested having an operation on the baby immediately. 
D. She found something similar between the baby and its father.

Context: The World Health Organization(WHO)planned to study the relationship between the eating habits of the people and the disease.Two doctors were chosen to make the study.
They flew to Africa south of the Sahara and during the next two months visited ten countries.They found that serious diseases of poor eating, often mistaken for other diseases, existed in all parts of Africa.The diseases were similar and could therefore all be named kwashiorkor .The diseased children are usually from one to four years old.As the illness progresses, the child's stomach becomes swollen by liquid collecting in the body.The skin changes colour and may break out in open sores.The hair changes colour and starts to fall out.The patient loses all interest in his surroundings and even in food, and becomes so weak that he wants to lie down all the time.Stomach liquids are no longer produced.
The doctors reasoned that kwashiorkor was found in the young children of this age in many parts of Africa because of lack of milk or meat.Their mothers gave them foods full of starches instead of greatly needed proteins.They found that the addition of milk to the food of children suffering from kwashiorkor saved many lives. 
 Question:What's the best title for the article? 
A. Milk and Meat Are Daily Necessities 
B. Kwashiorkor and Bad Eating Habits

D. A Case of Eating Habits

Context: Many years ago, my dad was diagnosed   with a serious heart disease. He was put on permanent disability, but he still wanted to do something to keep himself busy, so he decided to volunteer at the local children's hospital. My dad loved kids. It was the perfect job for him. He would talk to them and play with them and do arts with them. 
    One of his kids was a girl with a rare disease that paralyzed   her from the neck down. I don't know the name of the disease, but I do know that it was very sad for a girl around eight or nine years old. She couldn't do anything, and she was very depressed. My dad decided to try to help her. He started visiting her in her room, bringing paints, brushes and paper. He stood the paper up against a backing, put the paintbrush in his mouth and began to paint. He didn't use his hands at all. Only his head would move. He visited her whenever he could and painted for her. All the while he would tell her, ""See, you can do anything you set your mind to."" 
    Finally , she began to paint by using her mouth, and she and my dad became friends. Soon after, the little girl was discharged . One day, in the lobby of the hospital, my dad noticed the front doors open and then in came the little girl who had been paralyzed, but this time she was walking. She ran straight over to my dad and hugged him really tight. She gave him a picture she had done using her hands. At the bottom it read: ""Thank you for helping me walk."" 
    My dad would cry every time he told us this story and so would we. He would say: ""sometimes love is more powerful than doctors."" 
 Question:Why did the author's father volunteer at the hospital? 
A. He wanted to be a doctor. 
B. He liked to be others. 
C. He didn't want to let himself lonely.

Context: As a first -year teacher at a Christian school ,I was expecting my fifth grade students to be prefect , perfect in behavior , in attitude , and I even expected the home-life of each student to be nearly perfect . I found , of course , that these students were not different from the children I taught in public school .These kids had behavior problems , bad attitudes ,and some even had strikingly difficult family lives .
One of my students in particular stands out in my mind .I'll call him Timothy for safety's sake. During the first day of class , I noticed that Timothy was different .Not only in physical appearance , but he also spoke strangely , as though a 35-year-old man were trapped inside his tiny , weak body .On many occasions , I heard Timothy speak of hate, how he hated his family .
I observed Timohy for several months and read up on his background and searched for any clue that would lead me closer to understanding this child's strange behavior .Finally I was directed to Timothy's older brother's cheating in an exam and had taken his anger out on Timothy at home .Timothy's parents , in turn , had contacted the school, blaming them for Timothy's problems.
I had written a letter to the administration asking that Timothy see a counselor . The school was in the process of contacting a counselor when Timothy was transferred to another school. His father hurried around my room collecting Timothy's things and left. That is the last we have seen or heard from Timothy. I was left with an empty desk and a broken heart. I cried for days afterwards. I felt as though I had done Timothy a _ ...I did not help him when he needed me. I still think about Timothy every day, and pray for him every morning. 
 Question:. From the passage we know that  _  . 
A. Timothy's father blamed the author for reading his son's file. 
B. The school didn't approve Timothy's seeing a counselor. 
C. The author felt guilty for not helping Timothy in time. 
D. Students at the Christian school don't have family problems except Timothy.

Context: No one can deny that buttons are an important clothing device. But, can they rise to the level of art? Organizers of an exhibit in New York think so.
Peter Souleo Wright organized ""The Button Show"" at Rush Arts Gallery in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Eleven artists used the small, ordinary objects to create sculptures, portraits and wearable art. Some of the works are political, some are personal and others are just fun.
Wright said each artist reimagines and repurposes the buttons to make art. ""What I tried to do with this show,"" he said , ""was to look at artists who were promoting that level of craft.""
He said he wanted the button art to be comparable to a painting ""because of the amount of detail and precision in the work"".
Artist Beau McCall produced ""A Harlem Hangover"". It looks like a wine bottle that fell over on a table. A stream of connected red buttons hang over the side, like wine flowing down. Similar red buttons form a small pool on the floor.
McCall layers buttons of different shapes and sizes to create the bottle. The stitching that holds them together is also part of the artistic design.
For San Francisco-based artist Lisa Kokin, buttons are highly personal. After her father died in 2001, she created a portrait of him using only buttons. That memorial to her father led to other button portraits, including those of activists Rosa Parks and Cesar Chavez.
Others use buttons for details. Artist Amalia Amaki of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, placed them on and around old photographs. Los Angeles artist Camilla Taylor attached buttons to three large sculptures that look like headless animals with long , narrow legs.
""The Button Show"" ends at March 12. The Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation paid for the exhibition. The foundation was created in 1995 by the Simmons brothers: artist Danny, hip-hop producer Russell and rapper Rev. Run. The foundation seeks to bring the artists to urban youth and to provide support for new artists. 
 Question:If you want to see ""The Button Show"", you should   _  . 
A. buy tickets before March 12 
B. phone Peter Souleo Wright before March 12 
C. go to Rush Arts Gallery 
D. go to the Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundationn

Context: From furniture to jewelry, from the medical industry to civil engineering,three--dimensional printing can turn all sorts of ideas into objects.
    ""I wanted to print large objects such as buildings,""said Behrokh Khoshnevis,professor of the University of Southern California.He planned to construct a house in 24 hours by applying 3D printing techniques,but he admitted there would be difficulties in meeting his goal.
   ""For example,if you run out of ink while printing on paper,you will throw that paper away.But you cannot throw half completed buildings away if your material gets stuck,""he said.Although the printed house is not available to visit,there is a chance for people in Shanghai to see items printed in 3D.
    The Belgium-based company Materialize NV is currently holding a 3D printing exhibition in Shanghai that started in late 2012 and will continue until the middle of this year.The company is eager to show Asia what is possible with 3D printing.
    ""All the pieces shown here are what cannot be made through traditional techniques. A good example of this customization is hearing aids More than l0 million people already use 3D printed hearing aids.all made according to the size of their ear.""said Wim Michiels, executive vice-president at Materialise NV.
    ""You can produce anything whenever and wherever you like.You don't need to set-up production lines for pieces that only need a limited amount of product.Setting up a production Line is a tot of work, takes a long time and is very expensive for a limited number of pieces"" said Michiels.
    Kim Francois,managing director of Matcrialise China,said their European and American clients have at ready made the next step toward additive manufacturing with small-series production such as hearing aids. 
 Question:According to Khoshnevis,what is the main difficulty in printing buildings? 
A. Time. 
B. Technique. 
C. Space. 
D. Material. 
 Answer: D
Context: In a unique research cooperation between Stratasys, Education, R&D departments and MIT's Self-Assembly Lab, a new process is being developed, known as 4D Printing.
The 4D printing concept, which allows materials to ""self-assemble  "" into 3D structures, was initially proposed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty member Skylar Tibbits. Tibbits and his team combined a strand   of plastic with a layer made out of ""smart"" material that could self-assemble in water. They advanced this concept by creating materials that can change into several different complicated shapes, though this kind of material remains the bottleneck of 4D technology.
To many people that are just starting to get used to the idea of 3D printers, the name 4D is causing confusion because they cannot understand where this fourth ""dimension"" coming from. 4D technology shares many of the same principles of 3D printing and is essentially still about creating a new, 3D structure out of certain component; however, Tibbits states the fourth dimension at work here comes from concept of the fourth dimension of time. The difference between these 3D and 4D creations is that these new forms have the ability to transform and adapt over time.
4D printing works through self-assembly -- a system where ""disordered elements form an ""ordered"" structure via an interaction. With these 4D printed materials, these disordered materials are strands or sheets of specially designed materials. Environmental changes then stimulate  a response from them so that they form a preprogrammed shape.
The idea of having adaptable technology that only relies on energy and non-human interactions raises some interesting questions about where 4D printing can be used and the practical applications in dangerous environments. This could mean improved infrastructures in extreme conditions, leading to a reduced need for workers to put themselves at risk, but the potential goes even further than that. The technology promises exciting new possibilities for a variety of applications. A solar panel or similar product could be produced in a flat shape onto which functional devices can be easily installed. It could then be changed to a compact shape for packing and shipping. After arriving at its destination, the product could be stimulated to form a different shape that serves its function. Also it could be used to build furniture, bikes, cars and even buildings. As with many of the ideas being put forward, it is easy to go a step too far into the extreme, but this just shows the potential of 4D in comparison to 3D.
The next stage for the research is to move from printing single strands to sheets and eventually whole structures. And water need not be the process ' s only energy source. 
 Question:The major problem concerning the development of 4D printing lies in   _  . 
A. producing essential 4D printers 
B. creating proper smart materials 
C. providing a suitable environment 
D. promoting practical applications 
 Answer: B
Context: To get a chocolate out of a box requires a lot of unpacking: the box has to be taken out of the paper bag in which it arrived, the cellophane   wrapper has to be tom off, the lid opened and the paper removed, the chocolate itself then has to be unwrapped from its own piece of paper:  But  _ .  It is now becoming increasingly difficult to buy anything that is not done up in beautiful wrapping.
The package itself is of no interest to the shopper, who usually throws it away immediately. Useless wrapping accounts for much of the refuse put out by the average London house-hold each week  So why is it done? Some of it, like the cellophane on meat, is necessary, but most of the rest is simply competitive selling.  This is absurd.Packaging is using up valuable energy and resources and polluting the environment.
Recycling is already happening with milk bottles which are returned to the dairies , washed out, and refilled. But both glass and paper are being threatened by the growing use of plastic. More dairies are experimenting with plastic bottles.
The trouble with plastic is that it does not rot  Some environmentalists argue that the only solution to the problem of ever increasing plastic containers is to throw away plastic altogether in the shops, a suggestion unacceptable to many producers who say there is no alternative   to their handy plastic packs.
It is evident that more research is needed into the recovery and re-use of various materials  and into the cost of collecting and recycling containers rather than producing new ones.  Unnecessary packaging, intended to be used just once, and make things look better so more people will buy them, is clearly becoming increasingly absurd  But it is.not so much a question of throwing away packaging as using it wisely.What is needed now is a more advanced approach  to using scarce resources for what is, after all,  a  ly unimportant function. 
 Question:Some environmentalists think that   _  . 
A. plastic packaging should be made more convenient 
B. no alternative can be found to plastic packaging 
C. too much plastic is wasted 
D. shops should stop using plastic containers

Context: Brush your teeth every day, dentists say. In the south of Africa, some people brush their teeth all day long.
They keep a small stick in their mouth to chew or scrub   their teeth all day. People cut the sticks from trees. They are the African toothbrushes. People there are used to brushing their teeth with sticks.
Africans think the sticks work better than toothbrushes. The sticks come from nature, and it is said that there is something special about them. The special thing may stop many kinds of tooth problems. ""If you have a bad tooth, it is a medicine,"" said Diop, a seller in Africa.
The sticks are also much cheaper than toothbrushes.
In Senegal  ,the chewing stick is called ""sothio"". It means ""to clean"" in their language. In east Africa,the stick is called ""mswaki"". It's their word for ""toothbrush"".
Even the dentists agree that the sticks seem to clean teeth better. Nowadays, some nice health stores in the United States start to sell chewing sticks. They think that the stick is natural kind of tooth care. 
 Question:When do the people in the south of Africa brush teeth with sticks? 
A. In the morning. 
B. In the afternoon. 
C. In the evening. 
D. All day. 
 Answer: D
Context: Perhaps it is hard to imagine that a bad tooth could be deadly. But doctors in the Washington area say a twelveyearold boy died last month of a tooth infection that spread to his brain. They say it might have been prevented if the boy had received the dental care he needed.
Experts at the National Institutes of Health say good dental care should start at birth. They say breast milk is the best food for the healthy development of teeth. Breast milk can help slow bacterial growth and acid production in the mouth.
When baby's teeth begin to appear,you can clean them with a wet toothbrush. Dentists say it is important to find soft toothbrushes made especially for babies,and use them very gently.
The use of fluoride   to protect teeth is common in many parts of the world. This natural element is often added to drinking water supplies. The fluoride mixes with enamel ,the hard surface on teeth,to help prevent holes,or cavities from forming.
But the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry points out that young children often swallow toothpaste when they brush their teeth. The group notes that swallowing fluoridated toothpaste can cause problems. So young children should be carefully supervised when they brush their teeth. And only a small amount of fluoridated toothpaste,the size of a green pea,should be used.
Parents often wonder what effects sucking a thumb or sucking on a pacifier might have on their baby's teeth. Dental experts generally agree that this is fine early in life.
The American Academy of Family Physicians says most kids stop sucking their thumbs by the age of four. If it continues,the group advises parents to talk to their child's dentist or doctor. It could influence the correct development of permanent teeth. 
 Question:The boy with a bad tooth died because  _  . 
A. his tooth disease was very deadly 
B. the doctor refused to treat him properly 
C. he didn't receive timely treatment 
D. something was wrong with his brain 
 Answer: C
Context: Since ancient times, people have known about its ability to reduce pain and high body temperature. More than 2000 years ago, the Greek doctor Hippocrates advised his patients to chew on the bark and leaves of the willow.
The tree contains a chemical called salicin . From salicin, researchers in the 1800s discovered how to make salicylic acid . And in 1897, a chemist named Felix Hoffmann at Friedrich Bayer and Company in Germany created acetyl salicylic acid. Later it became the active substance in a new medicine that Bayer called aspirin. The ""a"" came from acetyl. The ""spir"" came from the spirea plant, which also produces salicin. And the ""in"" Well, that is a common way to end medicine names.
In 1982, a British scientist shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in part for discovering how aspirin works. Sir John Vane found that aspirin blocks the body from making natural substances called prostaglandins .Prostaglandins have several effects on the body. Some cause pain and the expansion, or swelling( ; ), of damaged tissue. Others protect the lining of the stomach and small intestine. Prostaglandins also make the heart, kidneys and blood vessels  work well. But there is a problem. Aspirin works against all prostaglandins, good and bad. Scientists learned how aspirin interferes with an enzyme . One form of this enzyme makes the prostaglandin that causes pain and swelling. Another form of the enzyme creates a protective effect. So aspirin can reduce pain and swelling in damaged tissues. But it can also harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine . 
 Question:What can we know about aspirin according to the passage? 
A. Aspirin can treat almost diseases. 
B. Aspirin can create the protective enzyme. 
C. Aspirin can harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
D. Aspirin can protect the inside of the stomach and small intestine.

Context: Clean your ears, because airport security might soon be scanning them. According to a recent discovery, the shape of ears could provide a reliable new way of identifying people at airports.
Researchers discovered that ears of each person have a unique shape and they have created a system that can scan them. The ear scanning technique uses a technology called image ray transform that highlights all the tubular structures  of the ear and measures them. Professor Mark Nixon, a computer scientist who led the team from the University of Southampton, believes ear scanning could take place as passengers walk through security gates, for example, by placing cameras on either side to record an image of their ears. Comparing the results against a database of ear shapes, the new system could help airport security workers instantly identify passengers.
Nixon and his team tested 252 images of different ears and found the system was able to match each ear to a separate image held in its database with 99 percent accuracy.
Besides ear scanning, there have been other systems developed for identity recognition. 
""With facial recognition, the systems are often confused by crows feet  and other signs of ageing,"" Nixon said. ""Your ears, however, age very gracefully. They grow proportionally  and your lobe  gets a bit larger, but otherwise your ears are fully formed from birth."" What's more, facial recognition software is often confused by changes in expression so people need to control their faces and in some cases even avoid wearing make-up.
An ear scan system would also offer a less  _ alternative toretina  scanning, which requires passengers to stare at scanners from a close range.
Fingertip detection has long been the most effective way of identifying someone. Nixon expects there to be a combination of different techniques that can be used at the same time to identify a person."" 
 Question:Nixon has developed the ear scanning system while there's already the fingertip detection because   _  . 
A. ear scanning can be used at airports 
B. fingertip detection is not so convenient 
C. he doesn't think one system is enough

 Answer: C
Context: The size and shape  of your ears show your character more than any other parts of the face. Other parts of the face change shape as we get older, but ears do not change their shape. They only change in size.
Reading people's character from their ears is an old science. In very old times people thought that a person with big ears had a good and generous character. They thought that a person with pale, small ears was dangerous. They also thought that the shape of the ear showed if a person was musical. Today, too many people believe that the size and the shape of the ear help you know if a person is musical.
Ears are all different, and each characteristic has a meaning. Next time when you look at a person, see if his ears are large, medium-size or small. Look at the lobes (the lowest part of the ear). Do they stick to the face? Ears that are always red mean a person may easily get angry, or he / she just has high blood pressure  . Ears that are always cold and pale mean a person has a nervous character. And a big inside hole of the ear means a person is musical. 
 Question:We can guess Beethoven (a world-famous musician) may have. 
A. ears with a big inside hole 
B. round white ears 
C. ears with a hole in the lobes 
D. big red ears

Context: Doctors in hospital emergency rooms often see accidental poisonings . A frightened parent arrives with a child who swallowed a cleaning liquid. Or perhaps the harmful substance is a medicine. Or it might be a chemical product meant to kill insects. These are common causes of accidental poisoning.
In cases like this, look for medical help as soon as possible. Save the container of whatever caused the poisoning. And look on the container for information about anything that stops the effects of the poison. Save anything expelled   from the mouth of the victim. That way, doctors can examine it.
In the past, some people forced poisoning victims to empty the stomach. They used a liquid syrup of ipecac   to do this. But an organization of children's doctors no longer advises parents to keep syrup of ipecac. The American Academy of Pediatrics says some poisons can cause additional damage when they come back up the throat.
Millions of people know a way to save a person who is choking on something trapped in the throat. The method is commonly known as the Heimlich Maneuver or abdominal thrusts. The American Red Cross says a rescuer should first hit the person on the back five times between the shoulder bones. These back blows may ease the choking. If the airway is still blocked, the Red Cross suggests pushing hard five times along the victim's abdomen. The abdomen is the area between the chest and the hip   bones. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the text? 
A. Learning the basics of first aid 
B. Accidental poisonings 
C. Common causes of accidental poisoning 
D. Poisonings and first aid 
 Answer: A
Context: A blocked airway  can kill someone in three to four minutes, but it can take more than eight minutes for an ambulance to arrive. So a simple procedure such as opening someone's airway can save their life while they're waiting for emergency medical help. This means you're more likely to give first aid to someone you know than a stranger.
There are many misconceptions  surrounding first aid. Below are the 'most popular' ones with details of what you should do.
You should put butter or cream on a burn. The only thing you should put on a burn is cold water - keep the butter for cooking. Put the affected area under cold running water for at least ten minutes.
The best way to treat bleeding is to put the wound under a tap. If you put a bleeding wound under a tap you wash away the body's clotting agents  and make it bleed more. Instead put pressure on the wound with whatever is available to stop or slow down the flow of blood. As soon as possible call 999. Keep pressure on the wound until help arrives.
Nosebleeds are best treated by putting the head back. If you put the head back during a nosebleed, all the blood goes down the back of the airway. Instead advise them to tilt  their head forwards and ask the person to pinch  the end of their nose and breathe through their mouth.
You need lots of training to do first aid. You don't - what you mostly need is common sense. You can learn enough first aid in a few minutes to save someone's life - whether it's from a book, attending a course or watching videos online.
Remember: anyone can save a life

Context: What to do if a fire starts?
  Imagine it's late at night. You hear the smoke detectors go off. You smell smoke when you wake up. Do you know what to do?
If a fire starts in your home, remember your escape plan and leave as quickly as possible. Keep the following things in mind to make a safe escape.
* Call""Fire!""to warn everyone in your family.
* If you know where the fire is, close as many doors as possible between you and the fire.
* If you're in bed, roll out of bed and onto the floor. Crawl on the floor next to a wall. Being near the ground makes it easier to breathe. If possible, cover your mouth and nose with a wet cloth.
* Feel the entire surface of a door before you open it. If the door is warm or hot, do not open it. The fire is probably right outside your room. Find another way to leave the room. If the door is cool, open it a little.
* Look out and try to see the fire. If it is safe, leave the room. Remember to stay on the floor.
* If your clothes catch fire, stop immediately. Drop to the ground and roll. Remember:Stop, drop and roll.
* Call the fire department from outside and wait for help to arrive. 
 Question:What should you do if a fire starts and you are in bed? 
A. Jump out of bed and run away. 
B. Roll out of bed and stand on the floor. 
C. Stay in bed and then jump out of the window. 
D. Roll out of bed and onto the floor. 
 Answer: D
Context: Most people are aware that outdoor air pollution can damage their health,but many do not know that indoor air pollution can also have significant health effects.Environmental Protection Agency studies indicate that indoor levels of pollutants may be 3~5 times,and occasionally more than 100 times,higher than outdoor levels.These levels of indoor air pollutants may be of particular concern because most people spend about 90% of their time indoors.
There are many sources of indoor air pollution in any home.These include sources such as oil,gas,coal,wood,and tobacco products,building materials,wet or damp carpet,and furniture made of certain pressed wood products,products for household cleaning and maintenance,personal care,or hobbies,central heating and cooling systems.
Immediate effects may show up after a single exposure   or repeated exposures.These include _ of the eyes,nose,and throat,headaches,dizziness.Such immediate effects are usually shortterm and treatable.Sometimes the treatment is simply removing the person's exposure to the source of the pollution,if it can be identified.
The likelihood of immediate reactions to indoor air pollutants depends on several factors.Age and preexisting medical conditions are two important influences.In other cases,whether a person reacts to a pollutant depends on individual sensitivity,which varies tremendously from person to person.Some people can become sensitized to biological pollutants after repeated exposures,and it appears that some people can become sensitized to chemical pollutants as well.
Certain immediate effects are similar to those from colds or other viral   diseases,so it is often difficult to determine if the symptoms are a result of exposure to indoor air pollution.While pollutants commonly found in indoor air are responsible for many harmful effects,there is considerable uncertainty about what concentrations or periods of exposure are necessary to produce specific health problems.People also react very differently to exposure to indoor air pollutants.Therefore,further research is needed to better understand the effects of indoor air pollution and to find efficient ways to protect our health. 
 Question:Which of the following might be the best title for the passage? 
A. Reactions of Pollution 
B. Danger from Home 
C. Pollution Resources 
D. Different Pollutions

Context: Do you know you could get sick just by walking past a building? The bacteria  that cause Legionnaire's disease grow very fast in large modern buildings. They are carried by air through the buildings and outside. Legionnaire s disease is only one of the illnesses that are caused by ""sick buildings"".
Some buildings can make you ill because their heating and air-conditioning  are controlled . Air from outside cannot get in through the closed windows; This indoor air pollution is a growing problem.
Legionnaire's disease may be the most serious result of sick buildings, but other unpleasant illnesses can appear.People who work in some buildings suffer  from tiredness, feeling sick and headaches. Their offices look bright and clean, but invisible  and dangerous bacteria are in the air around them.
There is an answer to the problem. The air-conditioning and heating can be tested for bacteria. _ This is expensive to do, but the results are good. The people in the buildings no longer get sick, and everybody is happier. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE? 
A. Legionnaire's disease is only one of the results of ""sick buildings"". 
B. There is less and less indoor air pollution. 
C. The bacteria are not dangerous if the offices look bright and clean. 
D. If the tests for bacteria are expensive. the results are good. . 
 Answer: A
Context: FDA proposed the most sweeping food safety rules in decades, requiring farmers and food companies to be more cautious in the wake of deadly outbreaks in peanuts, cantaloupe  ,and leafy greens.
The long-overdue regulations are aimed at reducing the estimated 3,000 deaths a year from foodbome illness. Just since last summer, outbreaks of listeria  in cheese and salmonella in peanut butter, cantaloupe and mangoes have been linked to more than 400 illnesses and as many as seven deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The actual number of those sickened is likely much higher.
The FDA's proposed rules would require farmers to take new precautions against contamination  ,to include making sure workers5 hands are washed, irrigation   water is clean, and that animals stay out of fields. Food manufacturers will have to submit food safety plans to the government to show _ are keeping their operations clean.
Many responsible food companies and farmers are already following the steps that the FDA would now require them to take. But officials say the requirements could have saved lives and prevented illnesses in some of the large-scale outbreaks that have hit the country in recent years.
In a 2011 outbreak of listeria in cantaloupe that claimed 33 lives ,for example, FDA inspectors found pools of dirty water on the floor and old, dirty processing equipment at the Colorado farm where the cantaloupes were grown. In a peanut butter outbreak this year linked to 42 salmonella illnesses ,inspectors found samples of salmonella throughout a New Mexico peanut processing plant and multiple obvious safety problems ,such as birds flying over uncovered trucks of peanuts and employees not washing their hands.
Under the new rules, companies would have to lay out plans for preventing those sorts of problems and how they would correct them.
""The rules go very directly to preventing the types of outbreaks we have seen/,said Michael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods. 
 Question:The main task of FDA is probably  _ 
A. to protect and promote the public health 
B. to help those sickened recover 
C. to research on food safety measures 
D. to deal with water pollution 
 Answer: A
Context: People are more likely to wash their hands properly after using the toilet if they are shamed into it or think they are being watched, scientists said on Thursday.
Hand-washing is the cheapest way of controlling disease but less than one third of men and two thirds of women wash their hands with soap after going to the toilet, a British study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine showed.
But when prompted by an electronic message flashing up on a board asking: ""Is the person next to you washing with soap?,"" around 12 percent more men and 11 percent more women used soap.
Health authorities around the world are stepping up efforts to persuade people to be more hygienic and wash their hands properly to help slow the spread of H1N1 swine flu, which was declared a pandemic  by the World Health Organization in June.
""Hand-washing with soap has been ranked the most effective way for the worldwide control of disease,"" the study's authors wrote.
""It could save more than a million lives a year from diarrhoeal diseases, and prevent respiratory  infections -- the biggest causes of child mortality  in developing countries.""
In developed nations, hand-washing can help prevent the spread of viral infections like flu and sickness and diarrhea bugs like norovirus and rotavirus, as well as hospital-acquired infections like MRSA and C-difficile, the authors said.
The researchers studied the behavior of a quarter of a million people using toilets at motorway service stations in Britain over 32 days.Use of soap was monitored by sensors.
The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health to mark Global Hand-washing Day, showed that with no reminders, 32 percent of men and 64 percent of women used soap. 
 Question:We can conclude from the passage that   _  . 
A. Most people wash their hands after going to toilet. 
B. Many people can not wash their hands properly. 
C. Few people know Global Hand-washing Day. 
D. H1N1 swine flu was declared a pandemic. 
 Answer: B
Context: Nowadays, the food we eat seems to have great effects on our health. Although science has made enormous steps in making food more fit to eat, it has, at the same time, made many foods unfit to eat. Some research has shown that perhaps eighty percent of all human illnesses are related to diet and forty percent of cancer is related to the diet as well, especially cancer of the colon. Different cultures are more likely to cause certain different illnesses because of the food that is characteristic in these cultures.
That food is related to illness is not a new discovery. In 1945, about 68 years ago, government researchers realized that nitrates, commonly used to preserve color in meats, and other food additives, caused cancer. Yet, these carcinogenic additives remain in our food, and it becomes more difficult all the time to know which things on the packaging labels of processed food are helpful or harmful. The additives which we eat are not all so direct. Farmers often give penicillin to beef and living animals, and because of this, penicillin has been found in the milk of treated cow. Sometimes similar drugs are given to animals not for medical purposes, but for financial reasons. The farmers are simply trying to fatten the animals in order to obtain a higher price on the market. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has tried repeatedly to control these procedures, the practices continue. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is NOT true? 
A. Drugs are always given to animals for medical reasons 
B. Some of the additives in our food are added to the food itself and some are given to the living animals 
C. Researchers have known about the potential dangers of food additives for over thirty-five years. 
D. Food may cause forty percent of cancer in world.

Context: Darek Fidyka, a 38-year-old Bulgarian, had been paralyzed   from the chest down for four years after a knife attack. Scientists from Britain and Poland took cells from his nose, transplanted   them into his back and re-grew his spinal cord  . Now he can walk and even drive a car. The doctors were delighted but said it was the first step in a long journey.
The breakthrough came after 40 years of research by Professor Geoff Raisman, who found that cells had the possibility to repair damage to nasal   nerves, the only part of the nervous system that constantly re-grows. ""The idea was to take something from an area where the nervous system can repair itself and put it into an area that doesn't repair itself,"" Professor Raisman said.
Polish doctors injected   the nasal cells into Mr Fidyka's spinal cord above the injury and used some nerves from his ankle to form a bridge across the damaged tissue. The nasal cells appear to have caused the spinal nerves to repair themselves.
Professor Raisman achieved this with rats in the late 1990's, but this is his greatest success. ""I think the moment of discovery for me was Christmas in 1997 when I first saw a rat, which couldn't control its hand, put its hand out to me. That was an exciting moment, because I realized then that my belief that the nervous system could be repaired was true.""
Doctors chose the easiest case for their first attempt--it might not work for others. But there is a real sense of hope that an idea once thought impossible has been realized.
David Nicholls, who helped provide money for the breakthrough, said information about the breakthrough would be made available to researchers across the globe.
""What you've got to understand is that for three million paralyzed people in the world today, the world looks a totally brighter place than it did yesterday,"" he said. 
 Question:What made Professor Geoff Raisman begin to believe the nervous system can be repaired? 
A. His former study with other people. 
B. His operation on a paralyzed patient. 
C. His sudden thought about Christmas. 
D. His unusual experience with a sick rat. 
 Answer: D
Context: Rene Descartes' explanation of pain has long been acknowledged in medicine. He proposed that pain is a purely physical phenomenon - that tissue injury makes specific nerves send a signal to the brain, causing the mind to notice pain. The phenomenon, he said, is like pulling on a rope to ring a bell in the brain. It is hard to overstate how deeply fixed this account has become. In medicine, doctors see pain in Descartes' terms-- as a physical process, a sign of tissue injury.
The limitations of this explanation, however, have been apparent for some time, since people with obvious injuries sometimes report feeling no pain at all. Later, researchers proposed that Descartes' model be replaced with what they called the gate control theory of pain. They argued that before pain signals reach the brain, they must first go through a gating mechanism in the spinal cord . In some cases, this imaginary gate could simply stop pain signals from getting to the brain.
Their most _ suggestion was that what controlled the gate was not just signals from sensory nerves but also emotions and other ""output"" from the brain. They were saying that pulling on the rope need not make the bell ring. The bell itself--the mind-- could stop it. This theory led to a great deal of research into how such factors as mood, gender, and beliefs influence the experience of pain. In a British study, for example, researchers measured pain threshold and tolerance levels in 53 ballet dancers and 53 university students by using a common measurement: after immersing your hand in body-temperature water for two minutes to establish a baseline condition, you put your hand in a bowl of ice water and start a clock running. You mark the time when it begins to hurt: that is your pain threshold. Then you mark the time when it hurts too much to keep your hand in the water: that is your pain tolerance. The test is always stopped at 120 seconds, to prevent injury.
The results were striking. On average female students reported pain at 16 seconds and pulled their hands out of the ice water at 37 seconds. Female dancers were almost three times as long on both counts. Men in both groups had a higher threshold and tolerance for pain, but the difference between male dancers and male nondancers was nearly as large. What explains that difference? Probably it has something to do with the psychology of ballet dancers--a group known for self-discipline, physical fitness, and competitiveness, as well as by a high rate of chronic  injury. Their driven personalities and competitive culture evidently accustom them to pain. Other studies along these lines have shown that outgoing people have greater pain tolerance and that, with training, one can reduce one's sensitivity to pain.
There is also striking evidence that very simple kinds of mental suggestion can have powerful effects on pain. In one study of 500 patients undergoing dental procedures, those who were given a placebo  injection and promised that it would relieve their pain had the least discomfort-- not only less than the patients who got a placebo and were told nothing but also less than the patients who got actual drug without any promise that it would work.
Today it is abundantly evident that the brain is actively involved in the experience of pain and is no more bell on a string. Today every medical textbook teaches the gate control theory as fact. There's a problem with it, though. It explains people who have injuries but feel no pain, but it doesn't explain the reverse, which is far more common-- the millions of people who experience chronic pain, such as back pain, with no signs of injury whatsoever. So where does the pain come from? _ .

 Answer: A
Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle?

Context: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog.
Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation.
""The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,"" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery.
The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are ""extremely difficult, if not impossible"" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said.
The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face.
The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants,
Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue.
Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality
There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers.
Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant. 
 Question:The best title for the passage would be   _  . 
A. French Woman has First Partial Face Transplant 
B. First Face Transplant Opens Debate 
C. Risks and Ethical Problems of a Face Transplant 
D. A Complete Face Transplant of a French Woman

Context: ""Oh please God, no, no!"" Stephen Eldredge cried out when he saw his wife, Shelli, badly wounded on the side of the road. She had broken actually every long bone in her body, along with her pelvis, jaw, and cheekbones. He was terrified his bride would bleed to death.
Stephen and Shelli had married just six months before near their home in South Jordan, Utah. They were in Hawaii on a family vacation with two of their sons. The family had rented electric motors and headed towards a nature preserve near Waikiki. But Shelli had fallen behind and the family turned back to make sure she was okay.
Shelli lost so much blood that her heart couldn't function properly and she went into shock at the hospital. Physicians were able to make her come to herself. On the first and second days there, she lived through half a dozen operations. On day three, the worst of Stephen's fears came true. Shelli didn't wake. She had shown heart failure and lung failure. ""I thought every heartbeat would be her last,"" Stephen says.
As days passed with no change, one doctor gently asked if it was time to let Shelli go. An MRI showed her brain didn't have much chance of supporting life. Stephen couldn't bear the thought of trapping his wife's beautiful spirit in a body that would never work. If he kept her alive, what kind of life would she have ? He called family, religious leaders, and physician friends in Utah for guidance.
And he decided there still was a chance.
The family moved Shelli to a Utah hospital closer to home. In the next few weeks she started opening her eyes, but it wasn't entirely clear how conscious she was. Nearly seven weeks after the accident, Stephen was joking with his sister in the hospital room when he saw Shelli smile, a big toothy grin. ""Did you understand that?"" he asked. She smiled again. Stephen fell to his knees in thanks.
Shelli's recovery has been slow but steady. Initially, she couldn't remember much of the previous months, including her own wedding. Shelli has endured 17 operations so far and may require more surgery. She will definitely need more months of recovery. But she is able to walk. ""She's got her life back. She's able to love and be loved, and be the person she was."" Elovie says.

Context: One baby born with a defective windpipe   now has hope of breathing normally thanks to 3-D printing technology, NPR reported.
Garrett Peterson, now 18 months old, was born with tracheomalacia  , leaving him unable to breathe. The condition terrified his parents, who turned to specialist Dr. Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment.
Along with Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer who runs the university's 3-D printing lab, Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett's windpipe until it's strong enough to function independently. After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the ""splint"" with a 3-D printer.
""It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,"" Green told NPR.
On January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs?
Though he still remains in the hospital, Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery.  His parents are overjoyed, saying he's starting to act more interactive and alert.
As Garrett grows, the splint will expand and eventually dissolve in his body as his own windpipe strengthens enough to work independently.
3-D printing technology has allowed doctors to help patients in ways that they hope will continue to grow.
""We're talking about taking something like dust and converting it into body parts,"" Green said. ""And we're able to do things that were never possible before."" 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that   _  . 
A. Garrett is out of hospital with the help of 3-D printing technology. 
B. The splint will exist in Garrett's body for ever. 
C. It is difficult to operate the 3-D printer. 
D. Garrett's condition is critical.

Context: One baby born with a defective windpipe   now has hope of breathing normally thanks to 3-D printing technology, NPR reported.
Garrett Peterson, now 18 months old, was born with tracheomalacia  , leaving him unable to breathe. The condition terrified his parents, who turned to specialist Dr. Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment.
Along with Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer who runs the university's 3-D printing lab, Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett's windpipe until it's strong enough to function independently. After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the ""splint"" with a 3-D printer.
""It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,"" Green told NPR.
On January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs?
Though he still remains in the hospital, Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery.  His parents are overjoyed, saying he's starting to act more interactive and alert.
As Garrett grows, the splint will expand and eventually dissolve in his body as his own windpipe strengthens enough to work independently.
3-D printing technology has allowed doctors to help patients in ways that they hope will continue to grow.
""We're talking about taking something like dust and converting it into body parts,"" Green said. ""And we're able to do things that were never possible before."" 
 Question:According to the passage, doctors' attitude toward 3-D printing technology in medical care is   _  . 
A. positive 
B. negative 
C. unknown 
D. indifferent

Context: Often speakers at a meeting experience dry mouths and ask for a glass of water.You can solve the problem by activating the saliva in you mouth.First gently bite the edges of your tongue with your teeth.Or,press your entire tongue to the bottom of your mouth and hold it there until the saliva flow.Or you can imagine that you are slicing a big juicy lemon and sucking the juice.
Before you begin your talk,be kind to your voice.Avoid milk or creamy drinks which coat your throat.Keep your throat wet by drinking a little sweetened warm tea or water-down fruit juice.
If you sense that you are losing your voice,stop talking completely.Save your voice for your speech.You may feel foolish using paper to write notes,but the best thing you can do is to rest your voice.If you feel the need to see a doctor,perhaps getting some advice from a professional singer can be a better choice.In the meantime,do not even talk in a low voice.
What about drinking alcohol to wet your throat?I advise you not to touch alcohol before speaking.The problem with alcohol is that one drink gives you a little confidence.The second drink gives you even more confidence.Finally you will feel all-powerful and you will feel you can do everything,but in fact your brain and your mouth do not work together properly.Save the alcohol until after you finish speaking.
Perhaps you want to accept the advice,but you may wonder if you can ever change the habits of a lifetime.Of course you can.Goethe,who lived before indoor skating rinks or swimming pools,said,""We learn to skate in the summer and swim in the winter.""Take this message to heart and give yourself time to develop your new habits.If you are wiling to change,you will soon be able to say that you will never forget these techniques because they've become a part of your body. 
 Question:What is the purpose of the writer to use Goethe's words? 
A. To encourage one to go in for sports. 
B. To tell that Goethe had a strong willpower. 
C. To prove one can change his habits. 
D. To remind people of the techniques to develop a lifelong habits.

Context: All plant cells are capable of taking up water. Even dead ones do to a certain degree. Absorption of water by dead cell walls makes wood become larger.
In common land plants, the living cells of roots take upmost of the water. Land plants without roots do exist, however. Those greenish-yellow lichens you see on rocks in the high mountains have no roots. Half a billion years ago, when water plants started to enter the land, the first land plants did not have roots.
Even among the flowering plants, one finds rootless forms. These flowering plants are ""the higher plants"" because they evolved recently and are thus considered higher on the evolutionary scale .
In the Peruvian desert, there grows one of these rootless higher plants, a bromeliad. It is a relative of the pineapple. Even if this plant had roots, they would be of no use, because where the plant grows, it never rains. The plant gets its water only from the dew it collects at night, when its leaves cool off. Such rootless plants, of course, can be moved with ease, but they will only grow when they are placed out in the open. If they are placed too near a house, the radiation from the heat of the house prevents the leaves from cooling and so prevents dew from forming, and the plant dies.
In the southern United States and in Puerto Rico, one sees
growing high above the streets on the insulation of electric wires. These plants get their water from rain, and the only soil they ever come in contact with is the dust that may blow on their leaves. 
 Question:The ""bromeliad"" is a plant that    _    . 
A. has no roots 
B. is a pineapple 
C. can grow anywhere 
D. takes up water through its leaves 
 Answer: D
Context: A previously unknown kind of human group disappeared from the world so completely that it has left behind the merest piece of evidence that it ever existed -- a single bone from the little finger of a child, buried in a cave in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia. 
    Researchers removed DNA from the bone and reported that it differed obviously from that of both modern humans and of Neanderthals , living in Europe until the arrival of modern humans on the continent some 44,000 years ago. 
    The child carrying the DNA line was probably 5 to 7 years old, but it is not yet known if it was a boy or a girl. The finger bone was unearthed in 2008 from a place known as the Denisova cave. 
    Researchers are careful not to call the Denisova child a new human species, though it may prove to be so, because the evidence is initial. 
    But the genetic material removed from the bone, found in a layer laid down on the cave floor between 48,000 and 30,000 years ago, belonged to a distinct human line that traveled out of Africa at a different time from the two known ancient human species. Homo erectus , found in East Asia, left Africa two million years ago, and the ancestor of Neanderthals moved away some 500,000 years ago. The numbers of differences found in the child's DNA indicate that its ancestors left Africa about one million years ago. 
    The region was inhabited by both Neanderthals and modern humans at that time. Counting the new human line, three human species may have lived together. 
The standard view has long been that there were three human resettlements out of Africa -- those of Homo erectus; of the ancestor of Neanderthals; and finally, some 50,000 years ago, of modern humans. But in 2004, archaeologists reported that they had found the bones of small humans who lived on the Indonesian island of Flores until 13,000 years ago, causing a serious problem to this view. The new line is the second such challenge. 
If the nuclear DNA of the Denisova child should differ as much as its mitochondrial  DNA does from that of Neanderthals and modern humans, the case for declaring it a new species would be strengthened. But it would be unusual for a new species to be recognized on the basis of DNA alone. 
In new diggings starting this summer, archaeologists will look for remains more analytical than the finger bone. Researchers will also begin re-examining the fossil collections in museums to see if any wrongly assigned bones might belong instead to the new line.

Context: The _ is the tallest modern land animal. It can be over 5. 5 meters tall. Its neck alone may be 1. 9 meters long. Yet the giraffe has only seven bones in its neck, the same number as in the humans'. Even a small bird has many more bones in its neck than a tall giraffe. Each bone in a giraffe's neck is very long, while the bones in a human's neck are short. That makes the difference. A female giraffe gives birth to one baby at a time. The baby, called a calf, is about 1. 9 meters tall at birth. By the age of eight it is full-grown. The giraffe eats mostly leaves. Because it has a long neck, it can reach the high leaves on the trees.

Context: Nowadays, the food we eat seems to have great effects on our health. Although science has made enormous steps in making food more fit to eat, it has, at the same time, made many foods unfit to eat. Some research has shown that perhaps eighty percent of all human illnesses are related to diet and forty percent of cancer is related to the diet as well, especially cancer of the colon. Different cultures are more likely to cause certain different illnesses because of the food that is characteristic in these cultures.
That food is related to illness is not a new discovery. In 1945, about 68 years ago, government researchers realized that nitrates, commonly used to preserve color in meats, and other food additives, caused cancer. Yet, these carcinogenic additives remain in our food, and it becomes more difficult all the time to know which things on the packaging labels of processed food are helpful or harmful. The additives which we eat are not all so direct. Farmers often give penicillin to beef and living animals, and because of this, penicillin has been found in the milk of treated cow. Sometimes similar drugs are given to animals not for medical purposes, but for financial reasons. The farmers are simply trying to fatten the animals in order to obtain a higher price on the market. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has tried repeatedly to control these procedures, the practices continue.

Context: Health experts have long worried about the increasing rate of obesity in kids. It's an important concern: Being weight or obese during childhood can lead to serious problems normally seen in adults, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Poor diets and a lack of exercise are usually the causes. But would you ever have imagined there might be a connection between the bacteria that lived in your guts  when you were a baby and the chance that you would become overweight?
Scientists in Finland recently found just such a link. In a recent study, they showed that overweight kids had different species of bacteria living in their guts.
You probably think of bacteria only as germs that can make you sick. While it's true that some bacteria can make people ill, your body actually depends on some types of bacteria to help you digest food and extract nutrients from it. These ""good"" bacteria live in your guts, where they process the food you eat.
Human babies get these bacterial helpers from their moms. When a baby is born, some of the bacteria in the mother move into the baby's body. Growing babies get additional ""good"" bacteria from the milk their mothers produce. And it turns out the bacteria might play an important role in regulating weight just six years later.
So how could these bacteria affect weight? The researchers still haven't tested that question, but future tests might lead to an answer. 
 Question:The purpose of writing this passage is to   _  . 
A. introduce the role of bacteria in children's weight 
B. analyze the influence of obesity on kids 
C. give advice on how to lose weight quickly 
D. explain the function of bacteria in foods

Context: The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) is launching a new campaign called Hay Fever, which aims to teach rabbit owners how to correctly feed their rabbits.
Many rabbit owners wrongly take Bugs Bunny's advice and feed their rabbits an incorrect diet, according to the British animal charity. Rabbits do not naturally eat root vegetables, such as carrots, nor do they naturally eat lettuce , the charity said.
The charity said that people were using these foodstuffs as major parts of a rabbit's diet, when in fact they can cause health problems. Just 8% of owners knew what to correctly feed their rabbits, according to statistics.
This might explain why 11% of rabbits are suffering from tooth decay and a further 11% from digestive problems, according to research at the University of Bristol, commissioned by the RSPCA.
""We want all pet rabbits to be eating hay as their main food,"" said Rachel Roxburgh, an animal scientist for the charity. ""People also think their rabbits should eat carrots because that's what Bugs Bunny does. But he's a cartoon, real rabbits don't talk, and they shouldn't be eating carrots too often either.""
The RSPCA suggests giving rabbits daily handfuls of hay, around the same size as the rabbits themselves. They can also feed on grass, but not lawn clippings  .
To vary their diet and give them a treat, dark green vegetables are advised, including broccoli, kale and cabbage on a daily basis, as well as regular parts of commercial nuggets .
What do you feed your rabbits? Are you guilty of giving them one too many carrots? 
 Question:Which of the following are healthy foods for pet rabbits on a daily basis? 
A. carrots and grass 
B. hay and cabbage 
C. lettuce and kale

Context: The vitamins necessary for a healthy body are normally supplied by a good mixed diet, including a variety of fruits and green vegetables. It is only when people try to live on a very _ diet, say that when trying to lose weight, that it is necessary to make special provisions to supply the missing vitamins.
An example of the dangers of a restricted diet may be seen in the disease known as ""beri-beri"", which used to make large numbers of Eastern people who lived mainly on rice suffer. In the early years of last century, a Dutch scientist named Eijkman was trying to discover the cause of beri-beri. At first he thought it was transmitted by a germ   . He was working in a Japanese hospital, where the patients were fed on polished rice which had had the outer coverings removed from the grain, it was thought this would be easier for weak and sick people to digest.
Eijkman thought his germ theory was proved when he noticed the chickens in the hospital yard, which were fed on remains from the patients' plates, were also showing signs of the disease. He then tried to separate the germ, which he thought was causing the disease, but his experiments were interrupted by a hospital official, who ordered that the rice without coverings, even though left over by the patients, was too good for chickens. It should be recooked for the patients, and the chickens should be fed on cheap, rough rice with the outer coverings still on the grain.
Eijkman noticed that the chickens began to recover on the new diet. He began to consider the possibility that eating unmilled rice   somehow prevented or cured beri-beri--even that a lack of some ingredient   in the coverings may be the cause of the disease. Indeed this was the case. The element needed to prevent beri-beri was shortly afterwards separated from rice coverings and is now known as vitamin B. The milled rice, though more expensive, was in fact causing the disease the hospital was trying to cure. Nowadays, this terrible disease is much less common thanks to our knowledge of vitamins. 
 Question:What do we know about the disease beri-beri? 
A. It killed large numbers of people. 
B. It resulted from lack of vitamins. 
C. It was transmitted by milled rice. 
D. It was caused by diseased chickens.

Context: Feel tired lately? Has a doctor said he can't find anything wrong with you? Perhaps he sent you to a hospital, but all the advanced equipment there shows that there is nothing wrong with you.
Then , consider this: you might be in a state of sub - health  .
Sub - health, also called the third state or gray state, is explained as a borderline state between health and disease.
According to the survey by the National Health Organization, Over 45 percent of sub - healthy people are middle-aged or elderly. The percentage is even higher among people who work in management positions as well as students around exam week.
Symptoms  include a shortage of energy, depression, slow reactions, insomnia  and poor memory , Other symptoms include shortness of breath, sweating and aching in the waist and legs.
The key to preventing and recovering from sub - health, according to some medical experts, is to form good living habits, ale mate work and rest, exercise regularly, and take part in open air activities.
As for meals, people are advised to eat less salt and sugar . They should also eat more fresh vegetables, fruits, fish because they are rich in nutritional elements - vitamins and trace elements - that are important to the body.
Nutrition experts point out that it is not good to eat too much at one meal because it may cause unhealthy changes in the digestive tract  . They also say that a balanced diet is very helpful in avoiding sub - health. 
 Question:Middle - aged people may be easy to get sub - healthy because  _  . 
A. they have used up their energy 
B. they have lost their living hopes 
C. they have more pressure in life and work. 
D. they have changed their way of life

Context: People who are worried about bad breath often reach for a toothbrush or a gun. But in the future, personal breath monitoring may include far more than fresh breath.
In face, breath is so rich in chemical compounds that fully understanding it has proved challenging. Each breath contains gases like carbon dioxide, the volatile remains of recent snacks, medicines and even compounds taken in from things like carpeting or various kinds of air pollution. But breath detectors  can sort out these substances with increasing sensitivity . 
Scientists are building electronic sniffers that examine the exhaled air for signs of cancer, asthma , and other diseases.
""There are clear signatures in the breath for liver disease, kidney disease and heart disease. Breath is a rich mixture that can reflect out state of health and disease."" said Dr. Raed Dweik, director of the Cleveland Clinic, adding ""Breath analysis is the future of medical testing.""
He and his partners are testing a desktop system called BreathLink for use in rapid identification of diseases. The system is designed to work wherever there is an Internet connection. To use BreathLink, a person breathes into a long tube, and a breath sample is collected and analyzed within the system. Then it can detail chemical concentrations of the breath in graphics. Dr. Raed Dweik said, ""If you examine patients of asthma, you will find they have higher levels of nitric oxide  in their exhaled air. It reflects their abnormal symptoms in the lungs."" His tests have reached 85 percent accuracy so far in spotting people with some illness.
But some trained dogs, he pointed out, can sniff out cancer with 99 percent accuracy--although without the ability to identify particular compounds the way some detectors can.
""We are getting better and better,"" he said. ""But whether we will ever approach the accuracy of the dog--we don't know."" 
 Question:It can be inferred that  _ 
A. brushing teeth can improve one's bad breath 
B. there are leftovers like snacks and medicines in one's breath 
C. one can know exactly about his physical state through the breath 
D. breath analysis can be helpful in medical diagnosis 
 Answer: D
Context: Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do. 
 Question:Ray Birdwhistell believes that physical appearance   _  . 
A. has little to do with culture 
B. has much to do with culture 
C. is ever changing 
D. is different from place to place 
 Answer: B
Context: Most people call it ""body language"" -- the clues to the meaning that we get from gesture, facial expressions, posture -- everything that isn't spoken.Experts call it ""nonverbal communication,"" but it means the same thing: a second source of human communication that is often more reliable to understanding what is really going on than the words themselves.
       Understanding body language is important to success, whether in the business world or in our personal lives.However, most of our ideas about body language are wrong, according to modern communication research.
       There is a belief that people with shifty eyes are probably lying.As Paul Ekman says, ""When we asked people how they could tell if someone was lying, too much blinking and shifty eyes were the winners.But sometimes people act like that because they are shy.Liars pretend to be calm in order not to be caught.
       Ekman goes on to argue against such a wrong belief.Although this kind of body language is probably an expression of nervousness, it is not always because the person is lying.Shyness can,  for example, make people shift their eyes.To understand what someone's behavior means, you have to watch them carefully.
       There is also a belief that when meeting someone, the more eye contact , the better.As a result people would like to make initial contact in formal situations, like a job interview, by staring fixedly at the other human.Yet Ekman points out that most of us are comfortable with eye contact lasting a few seconds, but any eye contact that is longer than that can make us nervous. In short, you must carefully consider the speaker and the speaking environment.Experts suggest that unless you know about someone's basic communication style, you will have little hope in understanding their true feelings through body language.In other words, body language carries important but not always true messages. 
 Question:According to the passage, body language is   _  . 
A. a language that is not spoken 
B. a clue to get the meaning 
C. a reflection of people's behaviors 
D. a source of human communication 
 Answer: D
Context: People who have lost the ability to understand or use words due to brain damage are called aphasics . Such patients can be extremely good at something else. From the changing expressions on speakers' faces and the tones of their voices, they can tell lies from truths.
Doctors studying the human brain have given a number of examples of this amazing power of aphasics. Some have even compared this power to that of a dog with an ability to find out the drugs hidden in the baggage.
Recently, scientists carried out tests to see if all that was said about aphasics was true. They studied a mixed group of people. Some were normal; others were aphasics. It was proved that the aphasics were far ahead of the normal people in recognizing false speeches -- in most cases, the normal people were fooled by words, but the aphasics were not.
Some years ago, Dr. Oliver Sacks wrote in his book about his experiences with aphasics. He mentioned a particular case in a hospital. Some aphasics were watching the president giving a speech on TV. Since the president had been an actor earlier, making a good speech was no problem for him. He was trying to put his feelings into every word of his speech.
But his way of speaking had the opposite effect on the patients. They didn't seem to believe him. Instead, they burst into laughter. The aphasics knew that the president did not mean a word of what he was saying. He was lying!
Many doctors see aphasics as people who are not completely normal because they lack the ability to understand words. However, according to Dr. Sacks, they are more gifted than normal people. Normal people may get carried away by words. Aphasics seem to understand human expressions better, though they cannot understand words. 
 Question:How did the scientists study aphasics? 
A. By asking them to watch TV together. 
B. By comparing them with normal people. 
C. By organizing them into acting groups. 
D. By giving them chances to speak on TV.

Context: One baby born with a defective windpipe   now has hope of breathing normally thanks to 3-D printing technology, NPR reported.
Garrett Peterson, now 18 months old, was born with tracheomalacia  , leaving him unable to breathe. The condition terrified his parents, who turned to specialist Dr. Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment.
Along with Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer who runs the university's 3-D printing lab, Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett's windpipe until it's strong enough to function independently. After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the ""splint"" with a 3-D printer.
""It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,"" Green told NPR.
On January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs?
Though he still remains in the hospital, Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery.  His parents are overjoyed, saying he's starting to act more interactive and alert.
As Garrett grows, the splint will expand and eventually dissolve in his body as his own windpipe strengthens enough to work independently.
3-D printing technology has allowed doctors to help patients in ways that they hope will continue to grow.
""We're talking about taking something like dust and converting it into body parts,"" Green said. ""And we're able to do things that were never possible before."" 
 Question:According to the passage, doctors' attitude toward 3-D printing technology in medical care is   _  . 
A. positive 
B. negative 
C. unknown

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. "" 
 Question:Jennie gave her bone marrow to   _  . 
A. a close friend 
B. a stranger 
C. a classmate 
D. a

Context: When most of us look at our hands, we might notice that we need to clean, or stop biting our fingernails, and that's about it. But if you ask a doctor, he can see a whole lot more. Everything from poor diet and stress to serious kidney   problems can be revealed by a glance at your fingernails.
There are about 30 different nail signs that can be associated with medical issues, though may indicate more than one problem, according to Dr.Amy Derick, a clinical instructor of dermatology at Northwestern University.
Here are five of the things a doctor can tell about your health based on your fingernails.
1. People who aren't eating well and lack vitamin or dietary may have thinner than normal nails, which are more likely to break.
2.Horizontal   lines are associated with serious physical stress. They frequently occur in people who have gone through chemotherapy .They can also occur after some illnesses, injuries, or with severe malnourishment .Interestingly, there may be an altitude connection too. They've also been found in people who dove 1,000 feet and others who participated in an Everest exploration.
3. Vertical  lines, however, are generally not such a big deal. Some people are more genetically prone to them than others, but they're commonly associated with aging.
4. When people lack iron, their nails can turn spoon-like. Instead of curving down and covering the finger normally, they 'll start to rise up on the sides and front, like the part of a spoon that holds liquid.
5. Kidney and liver problems can create ""half-and-half nails"", where one part of the nail is white and the other part dark or pink, according to Derick.
Doctors note that because disease diagnosis is complex and some symptoms can be associated with different diseases, you should always see a medical professional if you are concerned about something you notice. 
 Question:Who will have horizontal lines on the nails ? 
A. A cancer patient who has received normal treatment. 
B. Hungry African children suffering from severe malnourishment. 
C. An explorer who had reached Zhangjiajie in Hunan Province. 
D. A patient with serious illness, like kidney and liver problems.

Context: If someone is lost in a forest(  ), he needs only study the trees around him carefully to find his way. On this half of the earth, he will find that the side of the tree with the most leaves and branches( ) is the south side. Also, by checking the tops of the trees, he will find that they lean( ) to the south too.
Another sign( ) for him to know where he is going is found in the bark.( ) That is brighter on the south side.The remanining( ) of a cut tree is also a finder, for its rings can give him another sign. The rings will be thinner on the south side and thicker on the north side.
One more sign: some very small plants grow at the foot of a tree and they point to the north.

Context: One baby born with a defective windpipe   now has hope of breathing normally thanks to 3-D printing technology, NPR reported.
Garrett Peterson, now 18 months old, was born with tracheomalacia  , leaving him unable to breathe. The condition terrified his parents, who turned to specialist Dr. Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment.
Along with Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer who runs the university's 3-D printing lab, Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett's windpipe until it's strong enough to function independently. After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the ""splint"" with a 3-D printer.
""It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,"" Green told NPR.
On January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs?
Though he still remains in the hospital, Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery.  His parents are overjoyed, saying he's starting to act more interactive and alert.
As Garrett grows, the splint will expand and eventually dissolve in his body as his own windpipe strengthens enough to work independently.
3-D printing technology has allowed doctors to help patients in ways that they hope will continue to grow.
""We're talking about taking something like dust and converting it into body parts,"" Green said. ""And we're able to do things that were never possible before.""

Context: Today, we know that the role of vitamins and minerals goes way beyond the prevention of deficiency diseases   to actually preventing cancer and heart disease, the most fearsome killers of our time. With this knowledge has come the widespread call for nutritional supplementation   -- and a confusing group of vitamin, mineral, and supplements lining the supermarket shelves.
Far from contributing to better health, however, nutritional supplements threaten to turn a scientific breakthrough into a nutritional disaster.
 _ of vitamins and minerals -- especially vitamins A, C, and E-- would have consumers believe that the little vitamin pill in the bottle is all they need for good health. Take your vitamins in the morning, and you're covered. It's okay to eat fast foods for the rest of the day or skip meals to achieve today's fashionably skinny look. But vitamins and minerals are only one part of the nutritional puzzle. A diet rich in fiber   and balanced in carbohydrates and protein is essential for good health. You can't get these things from a nutritional supplement. The focus on vitamin and mineral supplements may actually be robbing us of the full nutrition we seek.
And no supplement can compare to the quality of nutrition found in natural sources. For example, our bodies turn carotenes   from plant foods into vitamin A. Many supplements contain a single carotene, but natural sources are rich in many different carotenes. Many supplements contain a form of vitamin E that is made from chemicals, when natural vitamin E is more readily absorbed and used by the body. And science is still discovering the wealth of nutrients in foods.
You'd be hard-pressed to find a supplement as nutritionally comprehensive and powerful as a balanced diet. Even if you could, you'd pay much more than if you got the same nutritional value from natural sources.
But perhaps the greatest danger presented by nutritional supplements comes from the very real risks presented by self-medication. Anyone can walk into the market and buy as many different supplements as desired. The reported benefits of high dosages of certain nutrients have led some people to believe that the more the better. Many take several vitamin and mineral supplements without regard to possible consequences.
Surprising new research suggests that vitamin C pills may speed up hardening of the arteries, the underlying cause of heart attacks. Researchers said their findings support the recommendations of health organizations, which urge people to avoid high doses of supplements and to get their nutrients from food instead.
As appealing as they're made to sound, nutritional supplements are _ . If you're looking for good health, don't look on the supplement shelves of your supermarket. Look in the produce section instead. 
 Question:What has given rise to the great need for nutritional supplements? 
A. The knowledge of deficiency diseases. 
B. The low prices of nutritional supplements. 
C. The frighteningly high death rate from cancer and heart disease. 
D. The information about the role of vitamins and minerals in health. 
 Answer: D
Context: Many jobs must be done with two people. One person takes the lead. The other helps. So it is with the human body. Much of our body depends on the cooperation between substances. When they work together, chemical reactions take place smoothly. Body systems are kept in balance.
Some of the most important helpers in the job of good health are the substances we call vitamins. The word ""vitamin"" dates back to Polish scientist Casimir Funk in 1912. He was studying a substance in rice. Funk believed the substance belonged to a group of chemicals known as amines  . He added the Latin word ""vita"", meaning life. So he called the substance a ""vitamine""--an amine necessary for life.
Other studies found that not all vitamins were amines. So the name was shortened to vitamin. But Funk was correct in recognizing their importance.
Scientists have discovered 14 kinds of vitamins. They say vitamins help to carry out chemicals changes within cells. If we do not get enough of the vitamins, we are at risk of developing a number of diseases. _ brings us back to James Lind of Scotland. In the 1740s, Lind was a doctor for the British Navy. He was investigating a problem that had existed in the Navy for many years.
The problem was the disease scurvy . The sailors were weak from bleeding inside their bodies. Even the smallest wound would not heal. Doctor Lind thought the sailors were getting sick because they failed to eat some kinds of foods when they were at sea for many months.
Doctor Lind separated twelve sailors who had scurvy into two groups. He gave each group different foods to eat. One group got oranges and lemons. The other did not. The men who ate the fruit began to improve within seven days. The other men got weaker.
However, which foods should be eaten to keep us healthy? Let us look at some important vitamins for these answers. 
 Question:Why was the name ""vitamine"" shortened to ""vitamin""? 
A. Because Funk was totally wrong. 
B. Because few vitamins were amines. 
C. Because there were new findings. 
D. Because the latter was easy to remember. 
 Answer: C
Context: People should go outside and absorb some sunshine to help increase their vitamin D levels, some experts say. Arthritis Research UK. which is a British medical research organization dedicated to curing arthritis  , says vitamin D deficiency can cause bone loss, muscle function problems and, in some cases, rickets   in children.
The government recommends vitamin D supplements   for pregnant women and children aged under five. But on sunny days, a few minutes outdoors should achieve the same results, Arthritis Research UK says.
Figures show that up to a quarter of the population has low levels of vitamin D in their blood and the majority of pregnant women do not take vitamin D supplements. People aged over 65, pregnant and breast-feeding women and children aged six months to five years old are thought to be most at risk.
Vitamin D is essential to help the body absorb calcium   from food. Low levels of vitamin D can result in serious problems.
Alan Silman, the medical director of Arthritis Research UK, said, ""When the days are sunny, go out for a few minutes and expose your face and arms to the sunshine."" But he also had a warning on overexposure. ""Don't allow your skin to go red, and take care not to burn, particularly in strong sunshine and if you have fair or sensitive skin. From June to August, just 15 minutes is generally enough time.""
""In less sunny months,"" Alan Silman added, ""we recommend that people add more vitamin D in their diet by eating more oily fish such as salmon, tuna, and foods rich in vitamin D, such as cereals  ."" 
 Question:Lack of vitamin D may cause the following problems EXCEPT   _  . 
A. bone loss 
B. muscle function problems 
C. rickets in children. 
D. high blood pressure

Context: For centuries, medical pioneers have refined a variety of methods and medicines to treat sickness, injury, and disability, enabling people to live longer and healthier lives.
""A salamander (a small lizard-like animal) can grow back its leg. Why can't a human do the same?"" asked Peruvian-born surgeon Dr. Anthony Atala in a recent interview. The question, a reference to work aiming to grow new limbs for wounded soldiers, captures the inventive spirit of regenerative medicine. This innovative field seeks to provide patients with replacement body parts.
These parts are not made of steel; they are the real things --- living cells, tissue, and even organs.
Regenerative medicine is still mostly experimental, with clinical applications limited to procedures such as growing sheets of skin on burns and wounds. One of its most significant advances took place in 1999,when a research group at North Carolina's Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine conducted a successful organ replacement with a laboratory-grown bladder. Since then, the team, led by Dr. Atala, has continued to generate a variety of other tissues and organs  from kidneys to ears.
The field of regenerative medicine builds on work conducted in the early twentieth century with the first successful transplants of donated human soft tissue and bone. However, donor organs are not always the best option. First of all, they are in short supply, and many people die while waiting for an available organ; in the United States alone, more than 100,000 people are waiting for organ transplants. Secondly, a patient's body may ultimately reject the transplanted donor organ. An advantage of regenerative medicine is that the tissues are grown from a patient's own cells and will not be rejected by the body's immune system.
Today, several labs are working to create bioartificial body parts. Scientists at Columbia and Yale Universities have grown a jawbone and a lung. At the University of Minnesota, Doris Taylor has created a beating bioartificial rat heart. Dr. Atala's medical team has reported long-term success with bioengineered bladders implanted into young patients with spina bifida (a birth defect that involves the incomplete development of the spinal cord). And at the University of Michigan, H. David Humes has created an artificial kidney.
So far, the kidney procedure has only been used successfully with sheep, but there is hope that one day similar kidney will be implantable in a human patient. The continuing research of scientists such as these may eventually make donor organs unnecessary and, as a result, significantly increase individuals' chances of survival. 
 Question:Why is generative medicine considered innovative? 
A. It will provide patients with replacement soft tissues. 
B. It will strengthen the human body's immune system. 
C. It will shorten the time patients waiting for a donated organ. 
D. It will make patients live longer with bioartificial organs.

Context: When Elizabeth Kenny was a little girl, she fell off a horse and hurt her arm. Mrs. Kenny took her to a doctor in Toowoomba, Queensland. In the doctor's, Elizabeth saw many bottles of medicine standing in a row. Since then, she wanted to be a nurse. As soon as she was old enough, Elizabeth was trained in a hospital. After working for some time, she made a surprising discovery. Among her patients were some children who had lost the use of their legs because of polio ( ) . Kenny tried putting hot cloth on their legs and washing them in a special way. The results were great. The children were able to use their legs again.
Most doctors would not believe that children could get well in such a simple way. Gradually, however, she became famous. From 1993 on people from many parts of the world brought their children to Australia to receive treatment by this wonderful nurse. She was invited to America where her methods were used in many hospitals. Money was collected to build Kenny foundations which were for polio patients. Kenny died in 1952, but she will long be remembered for her fight against polio.

 Answer: C
Context: Darek Fidyka, a 38-year-old Bulgarian, had been paralyzed   from the chest down for four years after a knife attack. Scientists from Britain and Poland took cells from his nose, transplanted   them into his back and re-grew his spinal cord  . Now he can walk and even drive a car. The doctors were delighted but said it was the first step in a long journey.
The breakthrough came after 40 years of research by Professor Geoff Raisman, who found that cells had the possibility to repair damage to nasal   nerves, the only part of the nervous system that constantly re-grows. ""The idea was to take something from an area where the nervous system can repair itself and put it into an area that doesn't repair itself,"" Professor Raisman said.
Polish doctors injected   the nasal cells into Mr Fidyka's spinal cord above the injury and used some nerves from his ankle to form a bridge across the damaged tissue. The nasal cells appear to have caused the spinal nerves to repair themselves.
Professor Raisman achieved this with rats in the late 1990's, but this is his greatest success. ""I think the moment of discovery for me was Christmas in 1997 when I first saw a rat, which couldn't control its hand, put its hand out to me. That was an exciting moment, because I realized then that my belief that the nervous system could be repaired was true.""
Doctors chose the easiest case for their first attempt--it might not work for others. But there is a real sense of hope that an idea once thought impossible has been realized.
David Nicholls, who helped provide money for the breakthrough, said information about the breakthrough would be made available to researchers across the globe.
""What you've got to understand is that for three million paralyzed people in the world today, the world looks a totally brighter place than it did yesterday,"" he said. 
 Question:What made Professor Geoff Raisman begin to believe the nervous system can be repaired? 
A. His former study with other people. 
B. His operation on a paralyzed patient. 
C. His sudden thought about Christmas. 
D. His unusual experience with a sick rat.

Context: Driving home from work one evening in the heavy rain, I found a very wet, injured cat on the side of the road. He looked up at me, meowing pitifully. A car must have hit it so it wasn't able to move. I stopped my car and carried the cat in and went on driving.
At the nearest vet clinic, the vet gently examined it. ""He's about eight months old and has two broken legs, but I would need X-rays to know how serious the damage is,"" he told me. ""As he's not your cat, I don't know if you want to go ahead with this. It could be rather expensive.""
I knew it would cost me hundreds of dollars, but I agreed with his advice. The following morning the vet rang to say the X-rays confirmed two bad breaks in his legs. ""I'll operate on his legs and put metal pins in them to keep them fixed."" he told me.
That afternoon I went to pick up my little friend. There I could hardly recognize him. His previously dirty fur was now a beautiful silver grey. His front legs were in two casts and he lay there looking at me, purring  happily.
I thanked the doctor and went out to pay the bill. ""I think you've given me the wrong account,"" I said to the clerk. ""This is only $85. He's had X-rays and an operation on his legs."" ""No, that's right,"" she replied. ""The vet has only charged you for the medication. There's a message on the bottom.""
Written under the total were the words ""SPECIAL RATE FOR ADOPTIONS."" I was speechless at his kind and generous gesture. I paid the account and under his message I wrote ""WITH GRATEFUL THANKS, CAT AND MUM.""

Context: When the traffic lights turn red, we will stop driving a car or crossing a street. Why is red used for traffic lights instead of other colors?
As we know, scattering   happens when light goes through the air. For the same media  , if the _ is long, the sscattering will be short. If the wavelength is short, then the scattering will be long.
Of all lights we can see, red has the longest wavelength. So the scattering is the weakest. That means the red light travels far. In fact, it travels farther on rainy days.
Using the red light can help drivers in farther places see the lights. It helps drivers slow down or stop in time. So there will be fewer accidents. Moreover, red can also excite people. We can act more quickly when we see the color red. In a word, red lights help drivers stop in time and help prevent accidents.

Context: There are various reasons why cancers appear to be on the increase. For one thing, though their sufferers are to be found in all age groups, cancers are particularly likely to attack persons in their middle and advanced years. Naturally, since people live longer these years, there are more cancer sufferers than before. Again, with better methods of diagnosis  , doctors can more easily recognize cancerous growths that would formerly have passed unnoticed or that would have been wrongly diagnosed. It is also believed that certain habits and conditions of modern living, including heavy smoking and the pollution of the air, may leave people living in more cancer-causing conditions than before.
We all look forward to the day when a simple medical test can find cancer while it is still small. Researchers around the world are working on _ . Most of their work deals with the examination of the blood.
Researchers in Boston have found something in the blood of cancer patients that does not appear in healthy persons. The test showed which persons had cancer and which did not. It was correct more than 90 percent of the time.
The researchers believe the test may be able to show cancer very clearly in its development. Cancers discovered early usually can be treated successfully.
The test examines very small bits of fat in the blood called lipids  . Cancers seem to change lipids although doctors do not know why. The test showed differences between the lipids of the persons with cancer and the lipids of those without cancer.
The researchers say the new test could be a step to develop a simple way to check patients for cancer before the disease shows on an X-ray. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. A simple way to cancer 
B. Cancers can be cured

Context: Many people have never heard of Mesothelioma and are unaware of its symptoms. Although considered a rare form of cancer, each year the number of cases grows. With the prevalence of this disease on the rise, it is critical to understand why and how Mesothelioma develops and what courses of action can be taken in the event of diagnosis. The following is a list of frequently asked questions and answers that will provide you with some information on Mesothelioma, and the legal issues surrounding it.
What is Mesothelioma?
Mesothelioma is the term used to describe a cancerous tumor found in the mesothelial cells of an organ. The organs where this form of cancer is most commonly found are the lungs, heart and abdominal organs. Pleural Mesothelioma is cancer of the lung lining(,)and is the most common form of Mesothelioma.
What causes Mesothelioma?
Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos . Asbestos is often found in building materials used before the mid 1970's. In addition, materials such as pipes, boiler insulation, floor, ceiling and roof tiles may contain asbestos.
How much asbestos exposure will cause Mesothelioma?
Generally, the probability of developing this form of cancer is in accordance with the length of time you are exposed to asbestos. Also, your health is at risk if your exposure to asbestos is intense. It should be noted that Mesothelioma has a latency period of 20 to 50 years. This means that you may develop the disease long after your exposure to asbestos. On average, people tend to develop Mesothelioma somewhere between 35 and 40 years after exposure.
How quickly does Mesothelioma progress?
The onset of Mesothelioma is quite slow. Patients will begin to experience symptoms such as lower back pain and chest pain. These symptoms may also be accompanied by weight loss, fever and difficulty breathing. Unfortunately, once Mesothelioma develops, it quickly becomes aggressive and treatment must be sought immediately.
Can Mesothelioma be treated?
Doctors are able to use several traditional methods of cancer treatment for Mesothelioma, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Like all forms of cancer, detecting the disease at the earliest stage possible greatly increases the patient's chances for survival. If you have worked in an industry such as construction or suspect that you may have been exposed to asbestos, be alert for symptoms and contact your doctor immediately.
What legal courses of action can be taken?
Anyone suffering from Mesothelioma is entitled to compensation from asbestos manufacturers. Additionally, if you are the spouse or child of someone who has died from Mesothelioma, you are entitled to file a claim and seek compensation. 
 Question:We can learn from the text that   _  . 
A. Asbestos is to blame for Mesothelioma. 
B. Even if a person is exposed to asbestos for a while, he will die soon. 
C. All the employees can ask for compensation from asbestos manufacturers. 
D. Mesothelioma is a cancer familiar to many people.

Context: Elephants have impressed us for centuries. They are big, clever, and sociable. But what if someone told you that they may also hold the key to fighting cancer?
People have been wondering why elephants do not develop cancer, even though they have life spans that are similar to humans, living for around 50 to 70 years.
Now scientists believe they know why. A team at the University of Chicago, Us has found that elephants carry a large number of genes that stop tumors from developing. To be precise, they found 20 copies of an anti-tumor gene called TP 53 in elephants. Most other species, humans included, only carry one copy.
According to the research, which was recently published on the online science network BioRxiv, the extra copies of the gene improved the animal's sensitivity to DNA damage. This lets the cells quickly kill themselves when damaged before they can form deadly tumors.
""An increased risk of developing cancer has stood in the way of the evolution of large body sizes in many animals,"" study author Dr Vincent Lynch told The Guardian. If every living cell has the same chance of becoming cancerous, large creatures with long life spans like whales and elephants should have a greater risk of developing cancer than humans and mice do. But across species, the risk of cancer does not show a connection with body mass.
 _ was found by Oxford University scientist Richard Peto in the 1970s and later named ""Peto's paradox"". Evolutionary biologists believe it results from larger animals using protection that many smaller do not, In the elephant's case, the making of TP53 is nature's way of keeping this species alive.
The study also found that when the same genes were brought to life in mice, they had the same cancer resistance as elephants. This means researchers could use the discovery to develop new treatments that can help stop cancers from spreading or even developing in the first place.
""Nature has already figured out how to prevent cancer,"" said Joshua Schiffman, an oncologist at the School of Medicine, University of Utah, US.
""It's up to us to learn how different animals tackle the problem so we can use those strategies to prevent cancer in people."" 
 Question:According to Dr. Vincent Lynch, what has been a risk in the evolution of large animals? 
A. Extreme weather 
B. Cells killing themselves 
C. Human behavior 
D. A risk of deadly tumors

Context: Today, we know that the role of vitamins and minerals goes way beyond the prevention of deficiency diseases   to actually preventing cancer and heart disease, the most fearsome killers of our time. With this knowledge has come the widespread call for nutritional supplementation   -- and a confusing group of vitamin, mineral, and supplements lining the supermarket shelves.
Far from contributing to better health, however, nutritional supplements threaten to turn a scientific breakthrough into a nutritional disaster.
 _ of vitamins and minerals -- especially vitamins A, C, and E-- would have consumers believe that the little vitamin pill in the bottle is all they need for good health. Take your vitamins in the morning, and you're covered. It's okay to eat fast foods for the rest of the day or skip meals to achieve today's fashionably skinny look. But vitamins and minerals are only one part of the nutritional puzzle. A diet rich in fiber   and balanced in carbohydrates and protein is essential for good health. You can't get these things from a nutritional supplement. The focus on vitamin and mineral supplements may actually be robbing us of the full nutrition we seek.
And no supplement can compare to the quality of nutrition found in natural sources. For example, our bodies turn carotenes   from plant foods into vitamin A. Many supplements contain a single carotene, but natural sources are rich in many different carotenes. Many supplements contain a form of vitamin E that is made from chemicals, when natural vitamin E is more readily absorbed and used by the body. And science is still discovering the wealth of nutrients in foods.
You'd be hard-pressed to find a supplement as nutritionally comprehensive and powerful as a balanced diet. Even if you could, you'd pay much more than if you got the same nutritional value from natural sources.
But perhaps the greatest danger presented by nutritional supplements comes from the very real risks presented by self-medication. Anyone can walk into the market and buy as many different supplements as desired. The reported benefits of high dosages of certain nutrients have led some people to believe that the more the better. Many take several vitamin and mineral supplements without regard to possible consequences.
Surprising new research suggests that vitamin C pills may speed up hardening of the arteries, the underlying cause of heart attacks. Researchers said their findings support the recommendations of health organizations, which urge people to avoid high doses of supplements and to get their nutrients from food instead.
As appealing as they're made to sound, nutritional supplements are _ . If you're looking for good health, don't look on the supplement shelves of your supermarket. Look in the produce section instead. 
 Question:What has given rise to the great need for nutritional supplements? 
A. The knowledge of deficiency diseases. 
B. The low prices of nutritional supplements. 
C. The frighteningly high death rate from cancer and heart disease. 
D. The information about the role of vitamins and minerals in health. 
 Answer: D

Context: People should go outside and absorb some sunshine to help increase their vitamin D levels, some experts say. Arthritis Research UK. which is a British medical research organization dedicated to curing arthritis  , says vitamin D deficiency can cause bone loss, muscle function problems and, in some cases, rickets   in children.
The government recommends vitamin D supplements   for pregnant women and children aged under five. But on sunny days, a few minutes outdoors should achieve the same results, Arthritis Research UK says.
Figures show that up to a quarter of the population has low levels of vitamin D in their blood and the majority of pregnant women do not take vitamin D supplements. People aged over 65, pregnant and breast-feeding women and children aged six months to five years old are thought to be most at risk.
Vitamin D is essential to help the body absorb calcium   from food. Low levels of vitamin D can result in serious problems.
Alan Silman, the medical director of Arthritis Research UK, said, ""When the days are sunny, go out for a few minutes and expose your face and arms to the sunshine."" But he also had a warning on overexposure. ""Don't allow your skin to go red, and take care not to burn, particularly in strong sunshine and if you have fair or sensitive skin. From June to August, just 15 minutes is generally enough time.""
""In less sunny months,"" Alan Silman added, ""we recommend that people add more vitamin D in their diet by eating more oily fish such as salmon, tuna, and foods rich in vitamin D, such as cereals  ."" 
 Question:Lack of vitamin D may cause the following problems EXCEPT   _  . 
A. bone loss 
B. muscle function problems 
C. rickets in children. 
D. high blood pressure 
 Answer: D
Context: Sometimes successful health campaigns can have quite unexpected reactions. The years of warnings about skin cancer mean that Britons are happy to cover themselves in sunscreen or stay out of the sun altogether, but it also means that most of us are not getting enough vitamin D.
Scientists announced yesterday that Britons need to increase to three times the amount of vitamin D they get per day. They called on food producers to fortify their products with more of the vitamin and suggested people should consider taking supplements  to keep levels up. They also suggested getting out in the sun for short periods more often, but they warned against ""sun bingeing"".
The government does not publish official advice on the amount of vitamin D people should take due to a lack of research, says Dr Birgit Teucher of the Institute for Food Research. But in the US, the government recommends 5 micrograms a day. By that count, Dr Birgit Teucher said that around 90% of Britons between 19 and 64 would be lacking in the vitamin because they only took around 3 micrograms a day.
Vitamin D is important for absorption of calcium by the body, which is needed for healthy teeth and bones. A lack of it can lead to serious diseases in both children and adults. The vitamin can be found in some foods but it can also be obtained from chemicals in the skin reacting to sunlight. Dr Barbara Boucher said adults should get 5 to 25 micrograms a day. Shortage of vitamin D may be linked to diseases such as muscle weakness, high blood pressure and rickets .
Dr Birgit Teucher gave several reasons for the lack among Britons. Increasing numbers of office-based jobs mean a lack of exposure to the sun; and the rise of becoming overweight means that vitamin D--which is fat soluble is increasingly stored in body fat, where it cannot be accessed readily.
Professor Brian Wharton of the Institute of Child Health said that children in particular needed to have enough vitamin D to prevent rickets.
Professor Graham Bentham, an environmental scientist at the University of East Anglia, added that babies who were only breast-fed probably need to take supplements in case their mother was vitamin D lacking. Those drinking milk were likely to be OK, thanks to the fortification of the drink.
The scientists called on food producers to fortify milk, bread and breakfast nutrient to enable people to get their daily amount of the vitamin. Prof Graham Bentham added that 30 minutes of sun exposure to the face and forearms between April and October would be _ . Outside these months, the sun is not strong enough in Britain for the body to produce its own vitamin D.
But Prof Graham Bentham warned against spending too long in the sun. ""Sun bingeing is well known to be dangerous,"" he said. ""In any case, vitamin D transformation in the skin switches off after a while so short frequent amounts are better for vitamin D formation.""

Context: Emergency rooms (ER) are supposed to cure people but Dr. John Stemgold wonders if working in an ER in Willits made him sick. The ER was downwind of the Remco chrome plant. ""I used to sit facing that window and kind of daydream out the window, looking at Remco, looking at the fog coming out of there. Then I would cough and cough."" Stemgold said.
What Dr.Stemgold didn't know was that Remco was flowing out Chromium VI into the air--- a chemical known to cause cancer and breathing problems in humans. A recent state health department study found that people who were in Willits when Remco was in operation from 1964 to 1995 are at higher risk for cancer because of Chromium VI exposure.

Still, Remco was allowed to flow out Chromium VI into the air.
In the battle to balance public health and a healthy economy, laws often favor business, Alan Ramo is a professor of law at Golden Gate University. ""There is a real drive to make money, to have employment. When there's a real job that's available and a theoretical risk of a chemical, jobs win out, business wins out.""
And chemicals are allowed to flood the marketplace and the government requires strict testing before any drugs can be sold. But the vast majority of industrial chemicals are put into use little testing of any kind Chemicals that people like us, you and me might be exposed to. Marilyn Underwood is with California state health department. "" You need to have the convincing evidence that something is bad to then start regulating it."" However, in most cases, chemicals are not tested until someone reports the abnormal, unnatural condition of the environment in general.
""I think that if people really knew what really goes on with environmental protection I think they would be shocked and they should be."" Says Professor Ramo. ""It might be valuable for other people to know what has happened to me, not for me but for them."" He said ""because they might be in a similar situation because of where they work.""

Context: One baby born with a defective windpipe   now has hope of breathing normally thanks to 3-D printing technology, NPR reported.
Garrett Peterson, now 18 months old, was born with tracheomalacia  , leaving him unable to breathe. The condition terrified his parents, who turned to specialist Dr. Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment.
Along with Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer who runs the university's 3-D printing lab, Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett's windpipe until it's strong enough to function independently. After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the ""splint"" with a 3-D printer.
""It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,"" Green told NPR.
On January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs?
Though he still remains in the hospital, Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery.  His parents are overjoyed, saying he's starting to act more interactive and alert.
As Garrett grows, the splint will expand and eventually dissolve in his body as his own windpipe strengthens enough to work independently.
3-D printing technology has allowed doctors to help patients in ways that they hope will continue to grow.
""We're talking about taking something like dust and converting it into body parts,"" Green said. ""And we're able to do things that were never possible before."" 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that   _  . 
A. Garrett is out of hospital with the help of 3-D printing technology. 
B. The splint will exist in Garrett's body for ever. 
C. It is difficult to operate the 3-D printer. 
D. Garrett's condition is critical.

Context: On Friday, Japanese researchers announced a population clock that showed a dangerous situation that the Japanese nation would disappear in 1,000 years if the falling birth rate kept the present level. Researchers in the northern city of Sendai said that Japan's population of children aged up to 14, which now stands at 16.6 million, was falling at the rate of one child per 100 seconds. It would lead to a terrible result that there would be no children left in Japan in 1,000 years.
""If the rate keeps falling at that rate in our country, there will only be one child who is able to enjoy the following Children's Day left on May 5th, 3011,"" said Hiroshi Yoshida, a professor at Toholu University. ""But 100 seconds later, a national disaster that there are no children left in Japan will happen,"" he added, ""The nation's people will disappear for the birth rate has fallen to the level that every woman has no more than two children, which started in 1975."" Yoshida said they created the population clock to make Japanese people pay close attention to that problem for their nation's future.
Another study showed that Japan's population was expected to fall to one third of the present population amount: 127.7 million in the next century. The Japanese government predicted that the birth rate would just become 1.35 children per parents within 50 years.
At the same time, Japanese life expectancy which is expected to ascend from 86.93 years in 2010 to 90.93 years in 2060 for women and from 79.64 years to 84.19 years for men has already been one of the highest in the world. More than 20 percent of the Japanese are aged 65 or over.
It means that Japan has become one of the countries with aging populations in the world. The problem of aging populations is a headache for the government and the Japanese economy because there are fewer and fewer workers who can make money for the country. However, the government has to face the terrible situation that it needs to offer a growing number of pensions. 
 Question:Why did researchers think Japanese people would disappear in 1,000 years? 
A. Because the Japanese are afraid of the changing environment. 
B. Because Japan will be destroyed by a serious earthquake. 
C. Because the birth rate of the nation is at a very low level. 
D. Because the country will sink in the Pacific Ocean gradually. 
 Answer: C
Context: In recent years, the world has made progress in reducing deaths among children under the age of five. A new report says an estimated 6.9 million children worldwide died before their fifth birthday. That compares to about twelve million in1990.
The report says child _ rates have fallen in all areas. It says the number of deaths is down by at least 50 percent in eastern, western and southeastern Asia. The number also fell in North Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.
Ties Boerma is head of the WHO's Department of Health Statistics and Informatics. He says most child deaths happen in just a few areas.
TIES BOERMA: ""Sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia face the greatest challenges in child survival. More than eighty percent of child deaths in the world occur in these two regions. About half of child deaths occur in just five countries--India, which actually takes twenty-four percent of the global total; Nigeria, eleven percent; the Democratic Republic of Congo, seven percent; Pakistan, five percent and China, four percent of under-five deaths in the world.""
Ties Boerma notes that, in developed countries, one child in one hundred fifty-two dies before his or her fifth birthday. But south of the Sahara Desert, one out of nine children dies before the age of five. In Asia, the mortality rate is one in sixteen.
The report lists the top five causes of death among children under five worldwide. They are pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria and problems both before and during birth.
Tessa Wardlaw is with the U-N Children's Fund. She is pleased with the progress being made in Sub-Saharan Africa. The area has the highest under-five mortality rate in the world. But she says the rate of decline in child deaths has more than doubled in Africa.
TESSA WARDLAW: ""We welcome the widespread progress in child survival, but we importantly want to stress that there's a lot of work that remains to be done. There's unfinished business and the fact is that today on average, around nineteen thousand children are still dying every day from largely preventable causes.""
The World Health Organization says one way to solve these problems is to make sure health care services are available to women. In this way, medical problems can be avoided or treated when identified. 
 Question:_   is the top-one cause of death among children under five worldwide. 
A. Global warming 
B. Malaria 
C. Pneumonia 
D. Diarrhea

Context: Scientists have recently discovered that mothers tend to hold their baby on the left.Of 255 right-handed mothers,83% held the baby on the left.And out of 32 left-handed women,78%held the baby on the left As a control( ),women were watched coming from supermarkets carrying baby-sized bags;the bags were held with no side preference.
Then,dental   patients were given a large rubber ball to hold during treatment.The majority held the ball to their left side,even when it was interrupted with the dentist's activities.
This suggested that in times of stress objects are held against the left side.
At that point,something clearly contrary was observed.A large number of mothers who brought their premature babies to a clinic were seen to hold their babies against their right side.
So,115 mothers who had been separated from their babies for 24 hours after birth were observed for holding response.The experimenters presented the baby directly to midline of the mother's body, and noted how she held the baby.53% placed the baby on the left and 47% on the right.And it was also noted that the mothers of the group who had held their baby on the left had already had a baby from which they had not been separated after birth.
Left-handed holding enables the baby to hear the heartbeat.In order to discover whether hearing the heart has a beneficial effect on the baby,the sound of a human heart-beat was played to 102 babies in a New York nursery for 4 days.A control group of babies was not exposed to heart-beats.The babies in the heart-beat group gained more weight and cried far less than the babies in the control group. 
 Question:The experiments proved that_. 
A. mothers have an instinct to hold their babies on the left immediately after birth 
B. mothers hold their babies on the left in times of stress 
C. mothers of premature babies do not have the instinct to hold their babies on the left 
D. mothers find it more comfortable to carry their babies on the left because the heart is on that side 
 Answer: C
Context: Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do. 
 Question:Ray Birdwhistell believes that physical appearance   _  . 
A. has little to do with culture 
B. has much to do with culture 
C. is ever changing 
D. is different from place to place 
 Answer: B
Context: A previously unknown kind of human group disappeared from the world so completely that it has left behind the merest piece of evidence that it ever existed -- a single bone from the little finger of a child, buried in a cave in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia. 
    Researchers removed DNA from the bone and reported that it differed obviously from that of both modern humans and of Neanderthals , living in Europe until the arrival of modern humans on the continent some 44,000 years ago. 
    The child carrying the DNA line was probably 5 to 7 years old, but it is not yet known if it was a boy or a girl. The finger bone was unearthed in 2008 from a place known as the Denisova cave. 
    Researchers are careful not to call the Denisova child a new human species, though it may prove to be so, because the evidence is initial. 
    But the genetic material removed from the bone, found in a layer laid down on the cave floor between 48,000 and 30,000 years ago, belonged to a distinct human line that traveled out of Africa at a different time from the two known ancient human species. Homo erectus , found in East Asia, left Africa two million years ago, and the ancestor of Neanderthals moved away some 500,000 years ago. The numbers of differences found in the child's DNA indicate that its ancestors left Africa about one million years ago. 
    The region was inhabited by both Neanderthals and modern humans at that time. Counting the new human line, three human species may have lived together. 
The standard view has long been that there were three human resettlements out of Africa -- those of Homo erectus; of the ancestor of Neanderthals; and finally, some 50,000 years ago, of modern humans. But in 2004, archaeologists reported that they had found the bones of small humans who lived on the Indonesian island of Flores until 13,000 years ago, causing a serious problem to this view. The new line is the second such challenge. 
If the nuclear DNA of the Denisova child should differ as much as its mitochondrial  DNA does from that of Neanderthals and modern humans, the case for declaring it a new species would be strengthened. But it would be unusual for a new species to be recognized on the basis of DNA alone. 
In new diggings starting this summer, archaeologists will look for remains more analytical than the finger bone. Researchers will also begin re-examining the fossil collections in museums to see if any wrongly assigned bones might belong instead to the new line.

 Answer: B
Context: A previously unknown kind of human group disappeared from the world so completely that it has left behind the merest piece of evidence that it ever existed -- a single bone from the little finger of a child, buried in a cave in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia. 
    Researchers removed DNA from the bone and reported that it differed obviously from that of both modern humans and of Neanderthals , living in Europe until the arrival of modern humans on the continent some 44,000 years ago. 
    The child carrying the DNA line was probably 5 to 7 years old, but it is not yet known if it was a boy or a girl. The finger bone was unearthed in 2008 from a place known as the Denisova cave. 
    Researchers are careful not to call the Denisova child a new human species, though it may prove to be so, because the evidence is initial. 
    But the genetic material removed from the bone, found in a layer laid down on the cave floor between 48,000 and 30,000 years ago, belonged to a distinct human line that traveled out of Africa at a different time from the two known ancient human species. Homo erectus , found in East Asia, left Africa two million years ago, and the ancestor of Neanderthals moved away some 500,000 years ago. The numbers of differences found in the child's DNA indicate that its ancestors left Africa about one million years ago.

Context: Perhaps it is hard to imagine that a bad tooth could be deadly. But doctors in the Washington area say a twelveyearold boy died last month of a tooth infection that spread to his brain. They say it might have been prevented if the boy had received the dental care he needed.
Experts at the National Institutes of Health say good dental care should start at birth. They say breast milk is the best food for the healthy development of teeth. Breast milk can help slow bacterial growth and acid production in the mouth.
When baby's teeth begin to appear,you can clean them with a wet toothbrush. Dentists say it is important to find soft toothbrushes made especially for babies,and use them very gently.
The use of fluoride   to protect teeth is common in many parts of the world. This natural element is often added to drinking water supplies. The fluoride mixes with enamel ,the hard surface on teeth,to help prevent holes,or cavities from forming.
But the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry points out that young children often swallow toothpaste when they brush their teeth. The group notes that swallowing fluoridated toothpaste can cause problems. So young children should be carefully supervised when they brush their teeth. And only a small amount of fluoridated toothpaste,the size of a green pea,should be used.
Parents often wonder what effects sucking a thumb or sucking on a pacifier might have on their baby's teeth. Dental experts generally agree that this is fine early in life.
The American Academy of Family Physicians says most kids stop sucking their thumbs by the age of four. If it continues,the group advises parents to talk to their child's dentist or doctor. It could influence the correct development of permanent teeth. 
 Question:The boy with a bad tooth died because  _  . 
A. his tooth disease was very deadly 
B. the doctor refused to treat him properly 
C. he didn't receive timely treatment 
D. something was wrong with his brain

Context: It is easier to float in the ocean than it is to float in a swimming pool. Do you know why?
         Ocean water is full of salt-- and salt water can hold up more weigh than fresh water. See for yourself!
         You Will Need:
*  3 cups of warm water
*  Measuring cup  
*  Wide-mouthed jar
*  Salt
*  Spoon 
*  Raw  potato
You Will Do:  Pour 1.5 cups      of warm water into the jar.Add 1/3 cup of      salt.Stir  until the      salt is completely dissolved.Add another      1.5 cups of water. Pour it slowly over the back of the spoon into the jar      so that the two liquid will not mix together. Gently      place the potato into the jar. Do not drop it.
What Will Happen:
The potato will sink-- but only halfway!
Why?
Salt water is heavier than fresh water, so it will stay on the bottom. The fresh water will remain on top.
The potato is heavier than the fresh water, but it is lighter than the salt water. That is why the potato will sink halfway down. 
 Question:In Step 4 of the experiment, why do you pour the water over the spoon ""slowly""? 
A. It is easier to see what you are doing. 
B. It pushes the fresh water to the bottom. 
C. It will keep the water from coming out. 
D. It will keep the liquids from mixing together.

Context: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the eleventh largest nation in Europe. England, Wales and Scotland make up the island of Great Britain, which takes up most of the Britain Isles. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are mountainous. The highest mountain is Ben Nevis in Scotland. Plains and valleys cover much of England. The British climate is mild.
About 58 million people live in the United Kingdom. Few other countries are so crowded. Four out of five people live in cities such as Belfast, Glasgow, and London. London is the capital. Great Britain grows half of the food it needs. Its industries help to pay for the food that is bought from abroad. The United Kingdom manufactures a wide range of goods. Service industries, such as tourism, that provide services rather than producing goods, are increasing. Traditional industries, such as coal mining, are declining. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the statements is true? 
A. Great Britain grows all of the food it needs. 
B. The United Kingdom manufactures a narrow range of goods. 
C. The speed of tourism in UK is increasing faster than producing goods. 
D. The coal mining is also increasing fast.

Context: In South America, the rich soil of the Amazon River basin in Brazil is known as ""black gold"". Scientists found that the secret of this rich soil was charcoal . Local people made it from animal bones and tree branches. They mixed the charcoal with the soil about 1.500 years ago.
Now, scientists in the United States have done a modern demonstration. They say charcoal fertilization offers a revolutionary way to improve soil quality for hundreds or even thousands of years.
Mingxin Guo and his team at Delavare State University heated tree leaves, corn stalks , small pieces of wood and poultry waste into ""biochar"" . They reported their findings at a recent meeting of the American Chemical Society in New Orleans.
Biochar could be good news for farmers with poor soil and hungry populations to feed. Professor Guo says it could even help against global warming. Intensive  farming and overuse of chemical fertilizer give out carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Biochar does the opposite, he says. It traps carbon in the ground.
The researchers planted winter wheat in containers of soil in a greenhouse -- some with biochar, some without. Professor Guo says the wheat grows much better in the pots with biochar. The soil was added two percent charcoal to. But he says even a one percent treatment will increase productivity.
The results demonstrated that biochar can increase organic matter in soil. Loss of nutrients in soil is an increasing problem worldwide as farmers try to grow more food for growing populations.
Next, the team will carry out a five-year study of biochar with spinach , green peppers and tomatoes.
Mingxin Guo says he learns about the ""black gold"" in Brazil from a magazine story. He explains that it was discovered in the jungle, in the area where waters flow to the Amazon, in the 1960's. But it was not until recent years that scientists began to bring public attention to it. 
 Question:According to the research, the biochar can help against global warming because it can   _  . 
A. reduce the carbon dioxide 
B. keep the carbon in the soil 
C. reduce the loss of nutrients in the soil 
D. absorb the carbon dioxide

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle? 
 Answer: A
Context: An exercise method (Gyrotonics) designed to stretch muscles and improve strength and balance is becoming popular in the United States. Here's more about Gyrotonics and the man who invented this special form of exercise.
Gyrotonics is a kind of exercise that combines the movements of dancing and swimming with the mental and physical practice called yoga. It helps lengthen muscles, improve balance, and exercise the joints, the parts of the body where bones are joined.
A Hungarian dancer named Juliu Horvath developed this special form of exercise. After he was injured in dancing, Mr. Horvath studied yoga intensely. In the 1980s, he developed a new exercise method as a special kind of yoga to strengthen dancers.
According to Mr. Horvath, his method was based on the octopus ,monkey and cat. He says these animals have no restrictions. They can move in any direction the Gyrotonic movements to help the human body move more freely.
A special machine made of wood and weights  helps guide the body through the Gyrotonics exercises. You sit or lie on a flat board. You put your legs or hands through special cloth handles attached to a line with weights. With the tension created by the weights, you must try to move through the exercises.
Seven kinds of backbone movements form the base of Gyrotonics. For example, you can stretch your back to the left and right or forward and backward. While moving your back, you can also work on arm or leg motions. These movements must be done in a smooth way. Often the motions are circular . 
When Juliu Horvath first developed Gyrotonics, he was the only teacher. Since then, he has taught almost 70 trainers. Now, there are more then 800 official schools in the world where you can learn Gyrotonics. 
 Question:This passage mainly focuses on   _  . 
A. A successful life of Horvath 
B. A popular kind of exercise 
C. Some advice on health care 
D. Some uses of a special machine

Context: When Elizabeth Kenny was a little girl, she fell off a horse and hurt her arm. Mrs. Kenny took her to a doctor in Toowoomba, Queensland. In the doctor's, Elizabeth saw many bottles of medicine standing in a row. Since then, she wanted to be a nurse. As soon as she was old enough, Elizabeth was trained in a hospital. After working for some time, she made a surprising discovery. Among her patients were some children who had lost the use of their legs because of polio ( ) . Kenny tried putting hot cloth on their legs and washing them in a special way. The results were great. The children were able to use their legs again.
Most doctors would not believe that children could get well in such a simple way. Gradually, however, she became famous. From 1993 on people from many parts of the world brought their children to Australia to receive treatment by this wonderful nurse. She was invited to America where her methods were used in many hospitals. Money was collected to build Kenny foundations which were for polio patients. Kenny died in 1952, but she will long be remembered for her fight against polio.

Context: When you run, you put force that is equal to three times your body weight on your feet. The human foot contains twenty muscles. This means that there is a lot that can go wrong when you run.
Most sports have some kind of running or jumping So experts at many shoe companies work hard to design good sport shoes. First, a designer enters a plan for a shoe into a computer .Engineers then improve the design. A second computer designs a model for the shoe. Then a few pairs are made. Next, the shoe is tested.
Different kinds of sports shoes are made for different uses. Some are made to help marathon  runners save energy during a race. Some are made for the stop-and-go kind of running tennis players. But all sport shoes have one thing in common: they are designed to help people's feet comfortable during sports. Today, nearly every sport has its own special shoe designed for just the kind of running that sport needs.

Context: Every year, World Blood Day is celebrated by blood services worldwide on 14 June, the birthday of Nobel Prize winner Karl Landsteiner, the man who discovered the ABO blood group system. If you have every thought of becoming a blood donor, just register to do it. And you should never worry about the donation.
Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body.
It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients.
First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday.
Although most people are able to give blood, some people who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease are no tasked to be donors. Pregnant women or those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood.
Blood has a very short shelf life. Some blood components can be kept longer than others, for instance red blood cells will keep for 35 days but platelets for only five. Remember, you should wait at least 16 weeks before donating blood again. 
 Question:What component of blood is used to treat burned patients? 
A. Plasma 
B. Red blood cell

Context: It's impossible to determine how many people would have lost their lives without the contribution of African-American inventor Dr Charles Drew.
Charles Drew was born on June 3, 1904, in Washington, DC. His early interest was in education, but he was also an outstanding athlete. While in college, he was awarded as the man who contributed the most to sports during his four years in school. Drew's sister Elsie suffered from tuberculosis  and died in 1920. Her death influenced his decision to study medicine.
After becoming a doctor and working as a college instructor, Drew went to Columbia University, where he earned his Doctor of Medical Science degree. During this time he became involved in research on blood and blood transfusions.
At Columbia, he wrote a paper on ""banked blood"", in which he described a technique he developed for the long-term preservation of blood plasma. Before his discovery, blood could not be stored for more than two days because of the rapid breakdown of red blood cells. Drew had discovered that by separating the plasma from the whole blood and then refrigerating them separately, they could be combined a week later for a blood transfusion. Drew became the first African American to receive a PhD in medical science.
After World War II broke out, Drew was called upon to put his techniques into practice. He was named a project director for the American Red Cross but soon quit his post after the government issued an order that blood taken from white donors should be separated from that of black donors.
On April 1, 1950, after he attended the annual free clinic at the John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, he and other three physicians decided to drive back home. As he was tired from spending the night before in the operating room, he lost control of his car. Drew was badly injured and was taken to Alamance General Hospital in Burlington, North Carolina. He was pronounced dead half an hour after he first received medical attention. Drew's funeral was held on April 5, 1950, at the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church in Washington, DC.
But contrary to popular thought, he was not refused a blood transfusion by an all-white hospital. He indeed received a transfusion but was beyond the help of the doctors attending to him. As Dr. John Ford, one of the doctors who survived the accident, later explained, ""We all received the very best of care. The fact that he was a Black did not in any way limit the care that was given to him."" Over the years, Drew has been considered one of the most honored figures in the medical field. 
 Question:According to the passage,   _   might have contributed to the invention of blood banks. 
A. the combination of blood cells 
B. the rapid breakdown of red blood cells 
C. the development of refrigerating technique 
D. the technique of separating plasma from the whole blood

Context: Many years ago, when I was working as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Lisa. The poor little girl had a very serious disease and was dying. The doctor had done his best but no medicine really worked. The only chance to save her seemed to be a blood transfusion  from her five-year-old brother. The little boy had the same disease before and had developed the antibodies  to fight the illness.
The doctor talked to the little boy about what they planned to do, and asked him if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate  for a moment. He took a deep breath and said, ""Yes, I'll do it if it can save Lisa.""
As the transfusion was going on, the little boy lay quietly in bed next to his sister. He looked at her and smiled all the time. When everything was done and the colour returned to his sister's face, his smile disappeared and he looked a little afraid. He looked up at the doctor and asked, "" Will I start to die now?""
He was too young to understand the doctor. He thought he would have to give all his blood to his sister, but he agreed. 
 Question:The doctor waited the little boy to   _  . 
A. give a11 his blood to his sister 
B. give some of his blood to his sister 
C. give his life to his sister 
D. get the same disease as his sister

Context: Do you know why different animals or pests have their special colors? Colors in them seem to be used mainly to protect themselves.
Some birds like eating locusts. but birds cannot easily catch them. Why? It is because locusts change their colors together with the change of the colors of crops. When crops are green, locusts look green. But as the harvest time comes, locusts change to the same brown color as crops have. Some other pests with different colors from plants are easily found and eaten by others. So they have to hide themselves for lives and appear only at night.
If you study the animal life, you'll find the main use of coloring is protecting themselves. Bears, lions and other animals move quietly through forests. They cannot be seen by hunters. This is because they have the colors much like the tree.
Have you ever noticed an even more strange act? A kind of fish in the sea can send out a kind of very black liquid when it faces danger. While the liquid spread over, the enemies cannot find it. And it immediately swims away. So it has lived up to now though it isn't strong at all.

 Question:People would die without  _ 
A. animals 
B. meat 
C. plants 
D. leaves 
 Answer: C
Context: Animals like the lion are known as carnivorous (meat-eating) animals. They feed on smaller animals. But many other animals eat grass or plants. They are called herbivorous (plant-eating) animals.
You may be surprised to learn that there are carnivorous plants as well as carnivorous animals. Plants that grow in poor soil need other food. They trap (catch by a trick) small insects   and take their bodies as food.
The pitcher plant   is a common carnivorous plant. This plant has a clever trap like a pitcher or jar. It even has a lid to keep out of the rain. The mouth of the pitcher is covered with something sweet like honeydew . Insects come to the plant to feed on the honeydew. When they have eaten all that is round the mouth, they go into the pitcher to look for more. There is more honeydew deep in the pitcher and they go down to feed on it. The inner wall of the pitcher is covered with fine hairs. These hairs point downwards so that the insects cannot climb out of the pitcher. They are trapped in it. They die there, and their bodies are taken as food by the plant.

Context: Sometimes,you just can't help it.Maybe you're watching a sad movie,or thinking about the friend who moved away.Next thing you know,your eyes are watering,and you have tears running down your cheeks.Why do people cry when they are emotional? What are tears? Scientists are working hard to find the answers to these questions.
Ad Vingerhoets is a professor of psychology at Tilburg University,in the Netherlands.He is one of the few scientists in the world who have studied crying.According to Vingerhoets,there are three types of tears.Basal tears are the first type.They lubricate the eyes and act as a protective barrier between the eye and the rest of the World.Next are reflex tears.They wash your eyes clean when something gets in them.Finally,there are emotional tears. ""These are released in response to emotional states,""explains Vingerhoets.""Especially when we feel helpless.""
Scientists believe that crying has something to do with how humans developed and learned to depend on each other.""Humans are very complex social creatures,""says Lauren Bylsma,a professor at the University of Pittsburgh,in Pennsylvania.""It seems that tears serve to arouse help and support from others,''She says.""Another reason we weep is that humans have the longest developmental period of almost any animal.It takes a long time to grow up.""
Vingerhoets agrees.""I think that the reason why humans shed tears has something to do with our childhood,""he says.""That's the time when we are stir dependent on adults for love and protection and care.The major advantage of emotional tears is that you can target them at a specific person.""Vingerhoets says this ability to target someone could have come in hand in prehistoric times,when humans were living among dangerous animals.Crying could attract predators .Tears were a safer way to get attention.In this case,it is better to use a silent signal to ask for help,""he says.
Vingerhoets and Bylsma do frequent studies to better understand why humans cry.According to Byhma,there is still much more to discover.""It's surprising,""she says,""how much we still don't know."" 
 Question:What can we learn from the passage? 
A. Emotional tears are better than reflex tears. 
B. Basal tears are a type of protective barrier. 
C. Tears helped frighten predators away. 
D. It's easy to understand why humans cry. 
 Answer: B
Context: What does it mean to cry over a book? ""I'm a reader who did not weep,"" Ruth Graham, a well-known critic, wrote. ""Does this make me heartless? Or does it make me a grown-up?""
Tears have played a surprisingly important part in the history of the novel. Readers have always asked about the role that emotion plays in reading: What does it mean to be deeply moved by a book? Which books are worthy objects of our feelings?
In different times, people answered those questions in different ways. In the early eighteenth century, when the novel was still a new form, crying was a sign of readers' virtue. ""Sentimental"" novels, full of touching scenes, gave readers an occasion to exercise their ""finer feelings."" Your tear proved that you were likely to feel the suffering of others.
At that time, sentimental novels were hugely popular, but also easy to attack. Tears, after all, had no necessary connection to actual virtue, and they could be not true  As the critic John Mullan points out, by the end of the eighteenth century, the word ""sentimental"" had acquired a new meaning -- ""addicted to low emotion"" -- bringing it closer to the meaning that it has for us today.
In the nineteenth century, the meaning of tears evolved in two different directions. Some writers sought to waken ""higher"" feelings in their readers: Victorian sentimentalists wrote touching scenes in an effort to inspire social and political reform. However, the ""sensation"" novel, a different type of Victorian best-seller, showed that tears could be enjoyable in themselves. Sensation novels were the leaders of the modern thriller and mystery. Heavy on secrets, and madness, they were known for creating physical ""sensations"" in their readers -- trembling, a fast beating heart, and tears. But these were tears without moral purpose or effect.
Today's debate about crying while reading looks back on all of this history. The debate, in fact, is about why books matter to us, and what reading is ""for."" Talking about what makes us cry is a way of talking about ourselves. 
 Question:From the passage we can know that ""sensation"" novels   _  . 
A. aimed for social and political reform 
B. helped understand others' suffering 
C. consisted of many touching scenes 
D. tended to amuse the readers 
 Answer: D
Context: When I was small and my grandmother died, I couldn't understand why I had no tears. But that night when my dad tried to cheer me up, my laugh turned into crying.
So it came as no surprise to learn that researchers believe crying and laughing come from the same part of the brain. Just as laughing has many health advantages, scientists are discovering that so, too, does crying.
Whatever it takes for us to reduce pressure is important to our emotional   health, and a study found that 85 percent of women and 73 percent of men report feeling better after crying.
Besides, tears attract help from other people. Researchers agree that when we cry, people around us become kinder and friendly and they are more ready to provide support and comfort. Tears also enable us to understand our emotions better; sometimes we don't even know we' re very sad until we cry. We learn about our emotions through crying, and then we can deal with them.
Just as crying can be healthy, not crying -- holding back tears of anger, pain or suffering -- can be bad for physical   health, Studies have shown that too much control of emotions can lead to high blood pressure, heart problems and some other illnesses. If you have a health problem, doctors will certainly not ask you to cry. But when you feel like crying, don't fight it. It's a natural -- and healthy -- emotional response  .

A. Power of Tears 
B. How to Keep Healthy 
C. Why We Cry 
D. A New Scientific Discovery 
 Answer: A
Context: Being an astronaut sounds cool, doesn't it?In space, they get to do some pretty amazing things, like floating in zero gravity.
However,there are also plenty of things that astronauts can't do because of their weightless environment, and that's very sad. What's worse, they can't even let their sadness show--because it's impossible to cry in zero gravity.
Of course, astronauts can still produce tears. But crying is much more difficult in space,reported The Atlantic in January. Without gravity, tears don't flow downward out of the eyes like they do here on Earth. This means that when you cry in space, your tears have nowhere to go--they just stick to your eyes.
In May 2011, astronaut Andrew Feustel experienced this during one of his spacewalks.""Tears,"" he said, ""don't fall off your eye... They just kind of stay there.""
Besides making your vision unclear, this can also cause physical pain. Back on Earth, tears are supposed to bring comfort to the eyes.But that's not the case in space.The space environment dries out astronauts' eyes, and when tears suddenly wet the eyes, it can cause pain rather than comfort. ""My right eye is painful like crazy."" Feustel told his teammate during the walk.
Since gravity doesn't work in space, astronauts need some extra help to get rid of the tears.Feustel chose to rub his eyes against his helmet to wipe the tears away. Another choice is to just wait--""When the tears get big enough they simply break free of the eye and float around,""astronaut Ron Parise told The Atlantic.
There are lots of small things--things like crying--that we are so used to on Earth. We usually take them for granted, until they become a problem in a totally different environment,like space. There, astronauts can't talk to each other directly. They also can't eat or drink in normal ways. They can't even burp , because there is no gravity to hold the food down in their stomach. If they do burp, they just end up throwing up  everything in their stomach,according to the UK National Space Center.
Thus, perhaps it's only space explorers who can honestly say:""Gravity, you're the best."" 
 Question:What effect do tears have on astronauts? 
A. They cause physical pain. 
B. They bring comfort to them. 
C. They make their vision clearer. 
D. They float around and cause trouble.

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle? 
 Answer: A
Context: Along with the Great Pyramid of Giza. The Sphinx  is one of the most studied ancient monument of mankind's history. The whole complex of Giza, composed of the Sphinx, the Great Pyramid, other pyramids, and distinct structures, definitely holds the key to understanding advanced past civilizations. In the examination of the mystery of the great Sphinx we run into a similar situation. The Egyptians wrote very little about the construction of the Sphinx. However, the Egyptians, Romans, and Arabs did write accounts concerning its numerous restorations, which will be discussed later in this article. In addition, it should be said that other cultures had their form of a Sphinx. For example, the Greek Sphinx was a female with a human head, breast, and the body of a feminine lion.
Now there are basically two schools of thought on the origin, the age and the builder of the Sphinx in Egypt. The traditional view of Egyptologists is that Pharaoh Khafre of the Fourth Dynasty built the Sphinx along with the Great Pyramid around 2,500 BC. The evidence is that the face of the Sphinx is thought to look like Pharaoh Khafre. This theory makes the Sphinx about 5,000 years old according to Dr Zahi Hawass, director of Giza Saqqara of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization.
The other school of thought doesn't believe that the Egyptians built the Sphinx, but thinks that it was built by an advanced civilization before the Egyptians. The Egyptians came later and built their tombs and temples along the sides of these great structures.  
This school of thought has been around for hundreds of years, but new buildings give it more  _ . Recently, Graham Hancock , the author of the famous book Finger-prints of the Gods and some American scholars have presented certain evidence that challenges the traditional thought on the Sphinx.
They present proofs that may cause a rethinking of the so-called fact used to determine who built the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid of Giza and for what purpose. Their proofs consist of basically two pieces of evidence astronomical  calculations of the stars and geological evidence that the erosion  of the Sphinx and other monuments of Giza was due to water rather than sand, wind or sunshine according to Robert Bauval's book  _ . It is this evidence that  has turned the Egyptologists' world upside down. 
 Question:Which of the following is the main purpose of the passage? 
A. To show the importance of the Sphinx. 
B. To tell us two views on the origin of the Sphinx. 
C. To introduce an advanced civilization to us. 
D. To explain some mysteries of the Sphinx.

Context: For those who have lonely nights and have trouble falling asleep, he is proving the ideal partner. This is a man who does not snore   in bed. And he is happy to wrap a comforting arm around his dearest until morning arrives.
       He does exist. He is the body-shaped pillow, the latest sleeping aid from Japan.
       This pillow comes without a head and is filled with foam. It's made by  _ and has a ""body"" and a flexible arm that can be curled around its owner.
       About 1,000 of the pillows have been sold since they went on sale in Japan last year and many buyers say they are pleased with their sleeping companion.
       ""This pillow makes me feel relaxed because I can hold the arm and feel something warm at my side,"" said 34-year-old radio DJ Junko Suzuki.
       But according to _ , the pillow is more than just an emotional help for those tired of spending the night alone. And it is shaped, the firm says, to support its partner on both sides to ensure a night of good sleep.
       The idea is to curl up in between the body and the flexible arm. The head just rests on the pillow's ""arm muscles"".
       ""My grandmother used to say that there is no more comfortable pillow than another person,"" said the firm president, Tomoki Kakehashi. ""So I thought that maybe people would want to sleep on a pillow shaped like an arm.""
       The pillows, on sale only in Japan for the moment, cost 8,500 yen(around US$80) each and come with shirt-or shirt-shaped pillow covers in blue, pink or green.

B. to advise people to use the body-shaped pillow 
C. to tell how the body-shaped pillow is invented 
D. to tell how the body-shaped pillow works

Context: For centuries, medical pioneers have refined a variety of methods and medicines to treat sickness, injury, and disability, enabling people to live longer and healthier lives.
""A salamander (a small lizard-like animal) can grow back its leg. Why can't a human do the same?"" asked Peruvian-born surgeon Dr. Anthony Atala in a recent interview. The question, a reference to work aiming to grow new limbs for wounded soldiers, captures the inventive spirit of regenerative medicine. This innovative field seeks to provide patients with replacement body parts.
These parts are not made of steel; they are the real things --- living cells, tissue, and even organs.
Regenerative medicine is still mostly experimental, with clinical applications limited to procedures such as growing sheets of skin on burns and wounds. One of its most significant advances took place in 1999,when a research group at North Carolina's Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine conducted a successful organ replacement with a laboratory-grown bladder. Since then, the team, led by Dr. Atala, has continued to generate a variety of other tissues and organs  from kidneys to ears.
The field of regenerative medicine builds on work conducted in the early twentieth century with the first successful transplants of donated human soft tissue and bone. However, donor organs are not always the best option. First of all, they are in short supply, and many people die while waiting for an available organ; in the United States alone, more than 100,000 people are waiting for organ transplants. Secondly, a patient's body may ultimately reject the transplanted donor organ. An advantage of regenerative medicine is that the tissues are grown from a patient's own cells and will not be rejected by the body's immune system.
Today, several labs are working to create bioartificial body parts. Scientists at Columbia and Yale Universities have grown a jawbone and a lung. At the University of Minnesota, Doris Taylor has created a beating bioartificial rat heart. Dr. Atala's medical team has reported long-term success with bioengineered bladders implanted into young patients with spina bifida (a birth defect that involves the incomplete development of the spinal cord). And at the University of Michigan, H. David Humes has created an artificial kidney.
So far, the kidney procedure has only been used successfully with sheep, but there is hope that one day similar kidney will be implantable in a human patient. The continuing research of scientists such as these may eventually make donor organs unnecessary and, as a result, significantly increase individuals' chances of survival.

A. Positive. 
B. Negative. 
C. Doubtful.

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle? 
 Answer: A
Context: Do women's minds work the same as men's? Absolutely not. At least, that is what most men are convinced of. Psychologists view the subject either as a matter or frustration or a joke. Now the biologists have moved into this minefield, and some of them have found that there are real differences between the brains of men and women. But being different, they point out hurriedly, is not the same as being better or worse.
There is, however, a definite structural variation between the male and female brain. The difference is in a part of the brain that is used in the most complex intellectual processes-the link between the two halves of the brain.
The two halves are linked by a trunkline of between 200 and 300 million nerves, the corpus callosum. Scientists have found quite recently that the corpus callosum in women is always larger and probably richer in nerve fibres than it is in men. This is the first time that a structural difference has been found between the brains of women and men and it must have some significance. The question is ""What?"", and, if this difference exists, are there others? Research shows that present-day women think differently and behave differently from men. Are some of these differences biological and inborn, a result of evolution? We tend to think that is the influence of society that produces these differences. But could we be wrong?
Research showed that these two halves of the brain had different functions, and that the corpus callosum enabled them to work together. For most people, the left half is used for word handing, analytical and logical activities; the right half works on pictures, patterns and forms. We need both halves working together. And the better the connections, the more harmoniously the two halves work. And, according to research findings, women have the better connections.
But it isn't all that easy to explain the actual differences between skills of men and women on this basis. In schools throughout the world girls tend to be better than boys at ""language subjects"" and boys better at maths and physics. If these differences correspond with the differences in the hemispheric trunkline, here is an unalterable distinction between the sexes.
We shan't know for a while, partly because we don't know of any precise relationship between abilities in school subject and the functioning of the two halves of the brain, and we cannot understand how the two halves interact via the corpus callosum. But this striking difference must have some effect and, because the difference is in the parts of the brain involved in intellect, we should be looking for differences in intellectual processing. 
 Question:At the end of the passage the author proposes more work on   _  . 
A. the brain structure as a whole 
B. the functioning of part of the brain 
C. the distinction between the sexes 
D. the effects of the corpus callosum 
 Answer: D
Context: Like distance runners on a measured course,all of us will move through time in a roughly predictable pattern.
In the first stage of our lives,we develop and grow, reaching toward the top of physical vitality .
After we grow up,however, the body begins a process of gradually wearing out.
A new awareness of physical fitness may help lengthen our years of health and vitality,yet nothing we do will work to stop the unavoidable force of aging.
Most of the changes of aging take place deep inside the body.The lungs become less able to take in oxygen.Powerful muscles gradually lose their strength.The heart loses power and pumps less blood.Bones grow easier to break.
Finally, we meet a stress,a stress that is greater than our physical resistance.Often,it is only a minor accident or chance infection(a disease caused by virus),but this time, _ brings life to an end.
In 1932,a classic experiment nearly doubled the lifetime of rats,simply by cutting back the calories in their diet The reason for the effect was then unknown.
Today, at the University of California at Berkley, Dr.Paul Seagle has also greatly lengthened the normal lifetime of rats.The result was achieved through a special protein limited diet,which had a great effect on the chemistry of the brain.Seagle showed that within the brain,specific chemicals control many of the signals that influence aging.By changing that chemical balance,the clock of aging can be reset.
For the first time, the mystery of why we age is being seriously challenged.Scientists in many fields are now making striking and far-reaching discoveries.
An average lifetime lasts 75 years,yet in each of us lies a potential for a longer life.If we could keep the vitality and resistance to disease that we have at age twenty, we would live for 800 years. 
 Question:What is probably the best title for the article? 
A. Two Great Experiments 
B. The Mystery of Human Life 
C. The Breakthrough in the Study of Aging 
D. Ways to lengthen Human Life

Context: Recently hand-foot-mouth disease has spread across China. In the past three months, there have been about 41,846 cases   in 30 provinces and regions. The number is increasing. Eighteen Chinese children have died of the disease so far this year.
What causes the disease and why is it dangerous?
Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common childhood illness. It mainly affects children under the age of 10. It gets its name from the rash   that develops on the hands and feet. It can also cause blisters   in your mouth.
A child who has the disease will usually have a fever, a runny nose and sore throat. He or she doesn't want to eat or drink because of pain in the mouth.
Hand-foot-mouth disease is mostly not serious. The fever and rash clear within a few days. But in some cases, the virus   affects the heart, lungs or brain. This puts the child's life in danger.
A virus causes hand-foot-mouth disease. The disease spreads easily where a lot of young children are together, such as in a child-care center. Sometimes it can also affect teenagers and adults.
In order not to pass on the virus, good hygiene   is important. We should wash our hands as often as possible. Especially we should wash our hands before meals and after going to the toilet. 
 Question:_   can help us to keep away from the hand-foot-mouth disease. 
A. Passing on the virus 
B. Taking children to the child-care center 
C. Keeping your hands clean 
D. Not going to public places 
 Answer: C
Context: How would you like to brush a crocodile's teeth? Or give a shark a bath? Cats are well-known for the way they keep themselves clean by licking , but other animals have their own ways to stay clean as well. And tidiness can be important for their survival. Even cockroaches  have to keep their feelers clean to help them into food.
Many animals in the wild, such as deer, wolves and bears, have an automatic cleaning system. Insects like to attach themselves to animals to feed on the skin or blood. These parasites  can be unhealthy. But their ""host"" animals are constantly dropping skin and fur by a natural process. They also like to rub up against trees or rocks to comfort themselves, and this removes additional skin and fur. Along with old fur goes the dirt and parasites living in the fur. While these animals may sometimes take a bath when they enter or cross a river or lake, they don't need the water to stay clean. They don't get sweaty, because they don't have sweat glands  all over their bodies the way people do. Growing new skin and fur is enough to keep them clean.
Some animals and birds use dust to get clean. Chinchillas, a kind of small animal that lives in the mountains of South America, have a very fine fur. (They are raised for their fur, in fact.) If they took water baths, they might get too cold. So, instead, they roll around in fine dust, raising quite a cloud as they ""bathe"". The dust helps to keep their fur and skin dry. This protects them from bacteria and parasites that enjoy warm and wet places. And the fine dust doesn't stick in their fur for long. It falls off or blows away.
As for lions and tigers, their rough tongues act like combs and can remove dirt and loose fur. Why is it important for them to stay clean and smooth? It helps them stay cool in very hot summer or feel warm in cold winter. 
 Question:It can be inferred from the passage that the way some animals stay clean_. 
A. is decided by their physical conditions 
B. is better than the way people do 
C. keeps them away from parasites all the time 
D. helps them survive any danger in the wild 
 Answer: A
Context: If you've ever seen the way dog people interacted with their pets, it comes as no surprise that there's some germ-exchanging going on there. A new study indicates that dog ownership specifically may be one of the biggest single contributors to what kinds of microbes live on your skin.
A team of researchers led by Se Jin Song at the University of Colorado, Boulder, took swabs  of the tongues, palms, forehead and feces  of members of 60 family households. Some of the families had children or household pets and some did not; dogs were the only pets swabbed.
Researchers then analyzed the DNA of the bacteria they found to determine how diverse the bacteria populations were. Not surprisingly, family members who lived together had more bacteria in common than members of separate households. Bacteria on the skin were especially similar within households, probably because we pass microbes through the air, through direct contact, and via the surfaces we touch.
The most surprising finding, however, was the large bacteria contribution Fidonad made. The skin bacteria of dog owners from different households was almost as similar as if they'd cohabited without a dog. Put another way, you and a friend across town who both own dogs share a skin ecosystem as alike as a married couple does.
The reason for this appears to be that dogs harbor some kinds of bacteria that are rare on human skin. One in particular, a family of bacteria called Methylophilaceae, was abundant in the mouths of dogs sampled as well as the skin of their owners--indicating ""a common occurrence of oral-skin transfer between dogs and their owners,"" according to the results published in the journal eLife. 
 Question:What does this passage mainly tell us? 
A. It is unsafe to keep dogs because of microbes. 
B. How many kinds of bacteria live on people's skin because of dog ownership. 
C. Dog ownership affects the kinds of microbes living on people's skin. 
D. What are the similarities between people who keep dogs and those who don't. 
 Answer: C
Context: The World Health Organization (WHO) planned to study the relationship between the eating habits of the people and the disease. Two doctors were chosen to make the study. They flew to Africa south of the Sahara and during the next two months visited ten countries. They found that serious diseases of poor eating, often mistaken for other diseases, existed in all parts of Africa. The diseases were similar and could therefore all be named kwashiorkor. The diseased children are usually from one to four years old. As the illness progresses, the child's stomach becomes swollen by liquid collecting in the body. The skin changes color and may break out in open sores . The hair changes color and starts to fall out. The patient loses all interest in his surroundings and even in food, and becomes so weak that he wants to lie down all the time. Stomach liquids are no longer produced.
The doctors reasoned that kwashiorkor was found in the young children of this age in many parts of Africa because of lack of milk or meat. Their mothers, after stopping their breastfeeding, gave them foods full of starches instead of greatly needed proteins. They found that the addition of milk to the food of the children suffering from kwashiorkor saved many lives.
The unbelievable thing about kwashiorkor is that the very existence of the disease--which has been killing thousands of children for centuries--was not even recognized in Latin America as recently as ten years ago. The deaths of those children were mistakenly listed as due to other diseases. It was the WHO's work in Africa that led to the discovery of the problem in Central America. 
 Question:It is difficult to discover kwashiorkor because   _   . 
A. it has no symptoms at all 
B. it is hard to identify signs of it 
C. it doesn't last long enough for careful observation 
D. it is hardly different from other diseases

Context: Most children have ever heard their parents yell ""sit up straight!"" or ""don't hang your head !"" when they eat dinner. Nowadays, it is also heard around another activity -- video games. Ten-year-old Owaish admits it takes him three to four hours a day to play games on his tablet computer. In addition, he plays for about two hours on the smart phone every day. As a result, he started suffering a serious pain in the neck around June or July. What's worse the pain has spread to the hand and back gradually, which makes his mother Mehzabin become concerned.
The doctors note the number of young children with the chronic pain  in their necks, arms and shoulders is on the increase sharp in recent years . They are not aging, they haven't had an accident, the blood reports are fine, their X-rays are fine, and their MRIs are fine. Facts have proved that the pain is from the poor posture  while they are playing video games on smart phones or other electronic devices. 19-year -old student Nida feels pain in the finger which holds the weight of her smart phone most of the day. Nida almost uses her smart phone 24/7, which means 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or all the time.
Health experts predict there will be not only physical but mental  problems resulting from the overuse of electronic devices. They encourage people to often take breaks and exercise from using computers, smart phones or other devices. Stand up! Stretch  the legs, back, shoulders and arms in all the possible directions. That's the most effective way and maybe the key to solving the problem completely. After all, the medication doesn't help sometimes.

Context: Dr.Michael Prager, a leading Botox expert, said that a growing number of women are developing something called ""computer face"".He also mentioned that professionals who worked long hours in front of a screen were ending up with saggy jowls , ""turkey neck"" and deep-set wrinkles on their forehead and around their eyes.
The Botox expert said that, of all his clients, office workers were most likely to show premature signs of ageing.""If you are one of the unfortunate people who frown while you are concentrating on the screen then, over time, you will inevitably end up with frown lines,"" Dr.Prager said.""What is perhaps more surprising is the number of women with saggy jowls because they are sitting in one position for so long.If you spend most of the time looking down then the neck muscles shorten and go saggy, eventually giving you a second neck.""
Dr.Prager, who has a practice near Harley Street in London, said he encourages his clients to put a mirror next to their computer so they can see if they are frowning at the screen.""When people are stressed or thinking hard about something, then they will often put on a 'grumpy face' without even knowing what they are doing.When my clients put a mirror next to their desk, they are often shocked by the angry, frowning face which stares back at them.""
He said, ""The women I am seeing at the moment have only been using computers at work for the last decade or so.But women in their 20s have grown up with them and use them for every single task.I think the problem is going to become much, much worse.In another ten years, they could be looking quite awful.""
Dr.Prager said there were several simple steps which could avoid ""computer face"" such as regular screen breaks and stretching the neck muscles.And, of course, there was always Botox.He said that, after a couple of sessions of Botox, the habit of ""grumpy face"" could be broken.

Context: Two years ago, Wendy Hasnip, 47, experienced a brain injury that left her speechless for two weeks. When she finally recovered, she found herself talking with what seemed to be a French accent: ""I phoned a friend the other day, and she spent the first ten minutes laughing,"" Hasnip said at the time. ""While I have nothing against the French.""
Hasnip suffered from foreign accent syndrome , a rare condition in which people find themselves speaking their own language Like someone from a foreign country. The condition usually occurs in people who have experienced a head injury or a stroke a sudden loss of consciousness, sensation, or movement caused by a blocked or broken blood vessel in the brain.
The condition was first identified during the Second World War in a Norwegian woman whose head was injured during an attack by the German military. The woman recovered but was left with a German-sounding accent, to the horror of fellow villagers who avoided her after that.
Researchers have discovered that the combined effect of the damage to several parts of the brain makes victims lengthen certain syllables, mispronounce sounds, and change,the normal pitch of their voice. Those changes in speech add up to what sounds like a foreign accent.
Another researcher, a phonetician ,says victims of the syndrome don't acquire a true foreign accent. Their strangely changed speech only resembles the foreign: accent with which it has a few sounds in common.
When an English woman named Annie recently developed foreign accent syndrome after a stroke, she spoke with what seemed to be a Scottish accent.
However, Annie's Scottish coworkers said she didn't sound at all like a Scot. 
 Question:If a person suffers foreign accent syndrome  _  . 
A. his coworkers will be afraid of him and avoid contacting with him

Context: A new factory that turns used wine bottles into green sand could revolutionize the recycling industry and help to filter  the nation's drinking water.
For the last 100 years special high grade white sand quarried  at Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire has been used to filter tap water to remove bacteria and impurities--but this may no longer be necessary.
The green sand has already been successfully tested by water companies and is being used in 50 swimming pools in Scotland to keep the water clean.
 _ by one million pounds from the European Union and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs(Defar), a company based in Scotland is building a factory to turn beverage bottles back into the sand from which they were made.
The idea is not only to avoid using up increasingly scarce sand in Scotland and avoid any further quarrying but also to solve a crisis in the recycles only 750 000 tones of it.
Howard Dryden, the scientist and managing director of the company has spent six years working on what he calls Active Filtration Meadia, or AFM, the recycled glass. He says he needs bottles that have already contained drinkable liquids to be sure that drinking water would not be polluted.
""The fact is that tests show that AFM does the job better than glass, it is easier to clean and reuse and has all sorts of properties that make it ideal for other applications, ""he claimed. He also thinks the market will be able to take 250 000 tones of green sand a year. The plan is to build five or six factories in cites in UK where the bottles come from to cut down on transport.
The factory will be completed this month and is expected to go into full production on January 14 next year. Once it is providing a ""regular"" product, the government's drinking water inspectorate will be asked to perform tests and approve it for general use by water companies. 
 Question:According to the passage, the new idea can do the following except   _  . 
A. cutting down the cost on transport 
B. avoiding using up increasingly scarce sand 
C. avoiding further quarrying of white sand 
D. solving the crisis in the recycling industry

Context: Drinking alcohol is a socially acceptable behavior in many parts of the world. Some medical experts say light drinking may even be good for your health, especially for the heart. But they say such health benefits should be compared to the many health risks connected with alcohol use.
Some research suggests that having one to two drinks of alcohol a day may offer some health benefits. Several large studies have shown that this type of moderate  drinking may lower the risk of heart disease and other diseases.
A study last year suggested that drinking small amounts of red wine may help lower the risk of breast cancer in women. Researchers at Medical Center in California studied 36 women. Each woman drank a glass of red or white wine every day for almost a month. Researchers collected blood samples from the women two times a month to measure their hormone  levels. The next month the women who drank red wine were told to drink white wine instead. The white wine drinkers were told to drink red wine. The researchers found that the women who drank red wine had lower levels of the female hormone than the white wine drinkers. They said red grapes have chemicals that may help to lower the risk of breast cancer.
However, recent studies suggested that even small amounts of alcohol may generally increase the risk of breast cancer in women. They found that women who drink four small glasses of wine a week increase their risk of breast cancer by 15 percent.
Many studies have examined the harmful effects of alcohol use on the body. Alicia Ann Kowalchuk serves as medical director, saying ""Healthy use for adults --- that's men under age 65 --- is no more than 4 drinks in a day and no more than 14 drinks in a week. And for women of all ages, it's no more than 7 drinks in a week and no more than 2 drinks in a day."" She says too much alcohol use has been linked to liver diseases, and many other cancers. 
 Question:Which of the following is the most beneficial to women with breast cancer? 
A. A glass of white wine per day. 
B. A glass of red wine per day. 
C. Small amounts of alcohol per day. 
D. Four small glasses of wine per day. 
 Answer: B
Context: Australian scientists say an organic compound  used by Indian women to paint dots or bindi on their foreheads could hold the key to a breakthrough in cancer treatment. Rose Bengal was first used in the early 1900s as a dye for food, textiles and cosmetics. But now it is proving to be a useful weapon in the fight against skin cancer.
Television advertisements constantly warn of the dangers of overexposure to the fierce sun. Among them is the possibility of the disease melanoma , a type of skin cancer. More than 1,200 Australians die every year from the disease.
Initial trials of a solution of Rose Bengal injected into some melanoma cells have had a 75 percent success rate in controlling the disease. Professor John Thompson, the director of the Melanoma Unit at the University of Sydney, says this organic dye could become a powerful cancer-fighting treatment.
""We believe it works by getting into the tumor  cells and causing them to self-destruct. But the exact mechanism by which it works is not totally clear. It's not useful for people who have a primary melanoma. The treatment of primary melanoma is surgical excision ,""he said. ""It's useful to inject tumors for people who have recurrences; when the primary treatment has failed and when recurrence in the area, or at more distant sites has occurred.""
About 90 percent of Australians who develop melanoma survive thanks to early diagnosis and treatment. If left untreated, however, the disease can be fatal.
Convincing younger people in Australia about the dangers of overexposure to the sun is a battle campaigners are constantly waging.
Veronica Manock, a 21-year-old student, had two major operations to remove a cancerous tumor from her leg.
""I've had a lot of friends who just said 'I thought it was just, you know, I'll get a mole  cut out and that's it', whereas I don't think people realize how much danger they're putting themselves into and how easy it is to stop something like this happening to you just from doing little things,""said Marock.
Other researchers in Australia are investigating genetic treatments to skin cancer. There is a pressing need for such research to produce effective treatments. Australians, the majority of whom are fair-skinned , are four times more likely to develop a melanoma than people in Canada, the United States or Great Britain. 
 Question:The information about Rose Bengal is wrong EXCEPT that  _  . 
A. it is no longer used as a dye 
B. it is used to cure skin cancer 
C. it is a special kind of rose planted in Australia 
D. it can be effective in treating skin cancer 
 Answer: D
Context: Can people change their skin colour without suffering like pop king Michael Jackson? Perhaps yes. Scientists have found the gene that determines skin colour. The gene comes in two versions, one of which is found in 99 per cent of Europeans. The other is found in 93 to 100 per cent of Africans, researchers at Pennsylvania State University report in the latest issue of Science.
Scientists have changed the colour of a dark-striped zebra fish to uniform gold by inserting a version of the pigment   gene into a young fish. As with humans, zebra fish skin colour is determined by pigment cells, which contain melanosomes  . The number, size and darkness of melanosomes per pigment cell determines skin colour.
It appears that, like the golden zebra fish, light-skinned Europeans also have a mutation  in the gene for melanosome production. This results in less pigmented skin. However, Keith Cheng, leader of the research team, points out that the mutation is different in human and zebra fish genes.
Humans acquired dark skin in Africa about 1.5 million years ago to protect bodies from ultra-violet rays of the sun, which can cause skin cancer. But when modern humans leave Africa to live in northern latitudes, they need more sunlight on their skin to produce vitamin D. So the related gene changes, according to Cheng. Asians have the same version of the gene as Africans, so they probably acquired their light skin through the action of some other gene that affects skin colours, said Cheng.
The new discovery could lead to medical treatments for skin cancer. It also could lead to research into ways to change skin colour without damaging it like chemical treatment done on Michael Jackson.

Context: Since ancient times, people have known about its ability to reduce pain and high body temperature. More than 2000 years ago, the Greek doctor Hippocrates advised his patients to chew on the bark and leaves of the willow.
The tree contains a chemical called salicin . From salicin, researchers in the 1800s discovered how to make salicylic acid . And in 1897, a chemist named Felix Hoffmann at Friedrich Bayer and Company in Germany created acetyl salicylic acid. Later it became the active substance in a new medicine that Bayer called aspirin. The ""a"" came from acetyl. The ""spir"" came from the spirea plant, which also produces salicin. And the ""in"" Well, that is a common way to end medicine names.
In 1982, a British scientist shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in part for discovering how aspirin works. Sir John Vane found that aspirin blocks the body from making natural substances called prostaglandins .Prostaglandins have several effects on the body. Some cause pain and the expansion, or swelling( ; ), of damaged tissue. Others protect the lining of the stomach and small intestine. Prostaglandins also make the heart, kidneys and blood vessels  work well. But there is a problem. Aspirin works against all prostaglandins, good and bad. Scientists learned how aspirin interferes with an enzyme . One form of this enzyme makes the prostaglandin that causes pain and swelling. Another form of the enzyme creates a protective effect. So aspirin can reduce pain and swelling in damaged tissues. But it can also harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine . 
 Question:What can we know about aspirin according to the passage? 
A. Aspirin can treat almost diseases. 
B. Aspirin can create the protective enzyme. 
C. Aspirin can harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
D. Aspirin can protect the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
 Answer: C

For children six to twelve years old, give half the amount. For children under six years old ,ask for your doctor's advice.
Reduce the amount if you suffer from restlessness or sleeplessness after taking the medicine"".

 Answer: A
Context: Medical drugs sometimes cause more damage than they cure. One solution to this problem is to put the drugs inside a capsule, protecting them from the body--and the body from them--until they can be released at just the right spot. There are lots of ways to trigger   this release, including changing temperature, acidity, and so on. But triggers can come with their own risks--burns, for example. Now, researchers in California have designed what could be a harmless trigger to date: shining near-infrared light (NIR, ) on the drug in the capsule.
The idea of using light to liberate the drug in the capsule isn't new. Researchers around the globe have developed polymers   and other materials that begin to break down when they absorb either ultraviolet (UV, ) or visible light. But tissues also readily absorb UV and visible light, which means the drug release can be triggered only near the skin, where the light can reach the capsule. NIR light largely passes through tissues, so researchers have tried to use it as a trigger. But few compounds   absorb NIR well and go through chemical changes.
That changed last year when Adah Almutairi, a chemist at the University of California, San Diego, reported that she and her colleagues had designed a polymer that breaks down when it absorbs NIR light. Their polymer used a commercially available NIR-absorbing group called o-nitrobenzyl (ONB). When they catch the light, ONB groups fall off the polymer, leading to its breakdown. But ONB is only a so-so NIR absorber, and it could be poisonous to cells when it separates from the polymer.
So Almutairi and her colleagues reported creating a new material for capsules that's even better.This one consists of a long chain of compounds called cresol groups linked in a polymer. Cresol contains reactive  components that make it highly unstable in its polymeric form, a feature Almutairi and her colleagues use to their advantage. After polymerizing the cresols, they cap each reactive component with a light-absorbing compound called Bhc. When the Bhcs absorb NIR light, the reactive groups are exposed and break the long polymer into two short chains. Shining additional light continues this breakdown, potentially releasing any drugs in the capsule. What's more, Almutairi says, Bhc is 10 times better at absorbing NIR than is ONB and is not poisonous to cells. 
 Question:Which word can be used to complete the following process of changes? 
A. protected 
B. formed 
C. exposed 
D. combined

Context: It is not always easy to understand inventions and new developments in science. To understand fiber optics , however, you can try an experiment.
Put a drop or two of milk into the glass of water. Turn off the lights. Shine the light from your flashlight  through the top of the glass at an angle  of about 45 degrees. Put a piece of white paper against the glass when the beam of light is shining. Move the paper so you can see where the beam is coming out of the glass. You should see a spot of light. Some of the light has passed through the water and through the glass. You see it on the paper. You also see another beam going down into the glass. It is being reflected down into the glass.
Next move the flashlight so that the beam is coming straighter down(30 degrees) into the water. You will see the same phenomenon: some of the light is reflected back into the glass. And some escapes out. Now move the beam of light from the flashlight slowly up until you cannot see any light escaping. This point is called the ""point of total internal reflection."" The word internal means ""inside."" All the light is staying inside the glass. There is no beam showing a bright spot on the white paper. All the light energy is inside the glass.
The glass of milky water is like a strand of glass. A fiber optic tube is a bundle of long thin strands of glass, really many tubes. However, the principle  is the same: at a certain angle, all the light energy that goes into the glass fiber comes out the other end.
Light is energy. Sound is energy. Radio waves and electricity are both energy. They can all be changed into light, and as light they can all travel along a glass fiber. Light travels at the rate of 186,000 miles per second. Therefore, a message can travel that fast in a glass fiber. This is the principle, or law of nature, that makes fiber optics work. 
 Question:The last step is to prove_. 
A. no beam is shown on the white paper 
B. no light can be noticed inside the glass 
C. no reflection can be seen 
D. no energy is wasted

Context: Linus Pauling,the only person who has won two undivided Nobel Prizes,was born in Portland,Oregon. He attended Washington High School but because of an unimportant detail he did not receive his diploma until 1962,long after he had received his Bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from Orgon State College in 1922. He had chosen to study his major because he could get a good job with it.
He won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1954 for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the explanation of the structure of complex substance. His interest in the ""behavior"" of molecules  led him from physical chemistry to biological chemistry,especially of the human body. He began with proteins and their main parts,the amino acids ,which are called the""building blocks of life"".In 1950,he constructed the first satisfactory model of a protein molecule,a discovery very important to the understanding of the living cell.
During World WarII,Pauling was a member of the Research Board for National Security,for which he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Merit in 1948. However,the use of the atomic bomb near the end of the war turned Pauling in a new direction. Having long worked on the structure of molecules,he took an immediate interest in the deadly effects of nuclear fallout on human molecular structures.
From then on,Pauling protested the production of the hydrogen bomb and supported the prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons. Through his efforts,The NuclearTestBan Treaty,declaring all nuclear tests to be illegal except underground ones,came into effect on October 10,1963,the same day Linus Pauling was awarded the Nobel Peace. 
 Question:Which of the following is legal according to The NuclearTestBan Treaty? 
A. The use of nuclear weapons. 
B. Testing hydrogen bomb on the ground. 
C. Testing hydrogen bomb on underground. 
D. The production of hydrogen bombs.

Context: Are you a volcano lover? Here is a list of some of the world's most beautiful volcanoes
that our travel agency can offer you to visit. Don't miss them!
Mount Mayon, the Philippines
Located about 450 km southeast of Manila on the island of Luzon, Mount Mayon is the
most active volcano in the Philippines; a September 2014 eruption forced thousands to flee the
area. Those who hike the volcano are rewarded with views of the towns in the Albay province
and the Pacific Ocean. But even those who prefer the view from a distance have a historical
good point at the Cagsawa Ruins, once an 18th Century Franciscan church that was destroyed
by an 1814 eruption.
Kilauea and Marina Kea, Hawaii
Hawaii's volcanoes are known for their active eruptions and extraordinary scenes. Mauna Kea is around one million years old, while Kilauea is the youngest volcano in Hawaii and has
been erupting continuously since 1983. The lava falls straight into the sea, creating fantastic
forms of black rocks and smoke clouds.
Mount Kelimutu, Indonesia
Kelimutu's three mysterious crater lakes attract both scientists and tourists to the island
of Flores in Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara province. One is emerald green  , another
dark red, and the third pitch black. Scientists say the lakes take on such colors because the
volcanic gases met the lakes' minerals centuries ago. 
 Question:People who hike Mount Mayon can enjoy the following EXCEPT   _  . 
A. views of the towns in the Albay province 
B. views of the Pacific Ocean 
C. views of the Cagsawa Ruins

Context: Often speakers at a meeting experience dry mouths and ask for a glass of water.You can solve the problem by activating the saliva in you mouth.First gently bite the edges of your tongue with your teeth.Or,press your entire tongue to the bottom of your mouth and hold it there until the saliva flow.Or you can imagine that you are slicing a big juicy lemon and sucking the juice.
Before you begin your talk,be kind to your voice.Avoid milk or creamy drinks which coat your throat.Keep your throat wet by drinking a little sweetened warm tea or water-down fruit juice.
If you sense that you are losing your voice,stop talking completely.Save your voice for your speech.You may feel foolish using paper to write notes,but the best thing you can do is to rest your voice.If you feel the need to see a doctor,perhaps getting some advice from a professional singer can be a better choice.In the meantime,do not even talk in a low voice.
What about drinking alcohol to wet your throat?I advise you not to touch alcohol before speaking.The problem with alcohol is that one drink gives you a little confidence.The second drink gives you even more confidence.Finally you will feel all-powerful and you will feel you can do everything,but in fact your brain and your mouth do not work together properly.Save the alcohol until after you finish speaking.
Perhaps you want to accept the advice,but you may wonder if you can ever change the habits of a lifetime.Of course you can.Goethe,who lived before indoor skating rinks or swimming pools,said,""We learn to skate in the summer and swim in the winter.""Take this message to heart and give yourself time to develop your new habits.If you are wiling to change,you will soon be able to say that you will never forget these techniques because they've become a part of your body.

B. To tell that Goethe had a strong willpower. 
C. To prove one can change his habits. 
D. To remind people of the techniques to develop a lifelong habits. 
 Answer: C
Context: Perhaps you have been told about some habits  which stop a person reading fast, and have been strongly asked to break those habits which you might have.
Do you still have any of these bad habits7 Check yourself by answering ""yes"" or ""no"" to
these questions:
1. Do you move your lips  when reading silently?
2. Do you point to words with your finger as you read?
3. Do you move your head from side to side as you read?
4. Do you read one word at a time?
If you answer ""yes"" to any of these questions, start at once to break the habit.
If you move your lips, hold your fingers over them, or hold a piece of paper between your lips while you are reading. Then if your lips move, you will know it and can stop them.
If you point to words, hold the two sides of your book, one side with your left hand, the other side with your right hand. Then you will not have a free finger to use in pointing while reading.
If you move your head, place your chin in one hand, and hold your head still(,).
If you read no more than one or two or three words at a time, you need to work very hard in learning to take in more words at each glance  as your eyes travel across the lines of words.

Florida chiropractor Dean Fishman began noticing an increased number of patients talking about neck and shoulder pain. He discovered these symptoms were due to the overuse of hand-held devices, particularly the action of bending the neck, and then _ the term ""Text Neck."" As if the painful symptoms weren't bad enough, Fishman warns that an untreated case of Text Neck could lead to permanent spinal  damage.
Other doctors have warned about ""iPad Hand,"" a condition that occurs when people use tablets like the iPad for hours at a time. Most people use their left hand to support the tablet and their right hand to tap or scroll. Doing this for long periods without changing positions can result in severe joint pain.
In order to avoid or reduce the possibility of getting Text Neck or iPad Hand, use the following basic ergonomic  principles:
Avoid awkward positioning. Don't strain your neck, and stay aware of how you are positioned in relation to the device. Make sure that both your neck and shoulders are relaxed and that you aren't leaning over for a long period of time.
Take frequent breaks when using any kind of mobile device. Many doctors recommend that users change their position every 15 minutes.
When using a tablet, use a case that can support the device on a table or your lap at a comfortable viewing angle.
Along with a case, use a separate keyboard with your tablet. This will be more comfortable since you'll be resting both hands on the keyboard. And since you won't be holding the tablet, you'll be less likely to experience hand or arm pain. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? 
A. If you are holding an iPad for long periods, it could cause spinal damage. 
B. Text Neck symptoms include long-term damage in the back. 
C. You are advised to lean over in relation to the device. 
D. You should rest your hands on the keyboard at times. 
 Answer: B
Context: Which animal has the fastest snapping jaw  ? If you're guessing a shark or perhaps a larger animal, you'll have to think smaller. The trapjaw ant, which lives in Central and South America, moves its mouth parts at 35 to 63 meters per second. Another way to think about this is that the ant's jaws close at 125 to 233 kilometers per hour. That's 2, 300 times faster than the blink of an eye.
Scientists were able to measure the amazing jaw speed using highspeed video techniques. Sheila Patek, a biologist, says the key is that the jaws have a springy   system, which is critical in getting explosive   speeds.
Consider a bow and arrow. If you try to throw an arrow with your arm, it won't go very far. If you use a bow, elastic energy stored in the bow is released almost instantly when you release the arrow with your finger or a latch. The combination of the springy bow and latch mechanism is what makes the arrow zoom through the air.
Maybe even more amazing than how fast these ants grab food or even enemies is how they use this same energy to move. As the ant closes its jaws, it uses them to push off the ground--all faster than the eye can see without slow motion video. A snap of the jaw can send an ant up to 8.3 centimeters into the air. That's like someone who is 1.7 meters jumping 13 meters high! Not only can they quickly escape from enemies, but often a group of ants will start jumping all at once. It would be hard for their enemies to grab just one.
People have suspected the ants used their jaws to jump for over a century, but could only prove it with today's modern video equipment. 
 Question:Which of the following may amaze the scientists most? 
A. How high the ants can leap by using their jaws. 
B. How quickly the trapjaw ants can move on the ground. 
C. How wonderfully the springy system in the trapjaw ants' jaws works. 
D. How quickly the trapjaw ants can grab food or enemies.

Context: The World Health Organization recently reported that the number of cases of tuberculosis(TB) has been _ since 2006 . Also, fewer people are dying from TB. But a study by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, says smoking could threaten this progress.
Nearly twenty percent of all people use tobacco, and millions of non-smokers get sick from breathing the smoke. The new study predicts that smoking will produce an additional thirty-four million TB deaths by 2024.
Efforts to control the spread of TB have mainly focused on finding and treating infections. Fewer efforts have been made to understand the causes. Dr Anthony Fauci is the director of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases. He said, ""Despite our control efforts, we still have more than a million people each year dying from TB and millions of people  getting infected; we realize it's still a very important problem. So we have to do the practical thing and we have to do the fundamental research things at the same time. ""
Smoking does not cause TB; bacteria cause the infection. But the study says smoking affects the nervous system in a way that makes an inactive case of TB more likely to develop into an active one. Stanton Glantz is the director of the University of California's Centre for Tobacco Control Research and Education and an author of the new study. He says it shows that TB cannot be controlled unless tobacco use is controlled.  He said, ""It increases the number of people who will get TB by about seven percent.""
The study is described as the first to identify a direct link between tobacco use and rates of TB infection and death. Professor Glantz says the results should guide those creating health policies and TB control efforts. He said, ""If you want to control the infectious disease of TB, you have to control the tobacco industry and the tobacco industry's efforts to increase tobacco use, particularly in developing countries where TB is a big problem."" 
 Question:What would Dr Anthony Fauci probably agree with? 
A. More efforts are needed to find the causes of TB infections. 
B. TB infections are no longer a serious problem. 
C. Few efforts have been put into the work of treating TB infections. 
D. The practical and the fundamental research cannot be done together at present. 
 Answer: A
Context: There are various reasons why cancers appear to be on the increase. For one thing, though their sufferers are to be found in all age groups, cancers are particularly likely to attack persons in their middle and advanced years. Naturally, since people live longer these years, there are more cancer sufferers than before. Again, with better methods of diagnosis  , doctors can more easily recognize cancerous growths that would formerly have passed unnoticed or that would have been wrongly diagnosed. It is also believed that certain habits and conditions of modern living, including heavy smoking and the pollution of the air, may leave people living in more cancer-causing conditions than before.
We all look forward to the day when a simple medical test can find cancer while it is still small. Researchers around the world are working on _ . Most of their work deals with the examination of the blood.
Researchers in Boston have found something in the blood of cancer patients that does not appear in healthy persons. The test showed which persons had cancer and which did not. It was correct more than 90 percent of the time.
The researchers believe the test may be able to show cancer very clearly in its development. Cancers discovered early usually can be treated successfully.
The test examines very small bits of fat in the blood called lipids  . Cancers seem to change lipids although doctors do not know why. The test showed differences between the lipids of the persons with cancer and the lipids of those without cancer.
The researchers say the new test could be a step to develop a simple way to check patients for cancer before the disease shows on an X-ray. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. A simple way to cancer 
B. Cancers can be cured

Context: SHANGHAI - Health experts in Shanghai are calling for more protection for young children as the latest research shows about half of the youngsters are suffering from secondhand smoke.
About 45 percent of children suffer passive smoking in families, 50 percent in public places, and almost 6 percent on public transportation, shows a research released by the Shanghai Children's Medical Center on Tuesday.
""Not only adults but also children and newborn babies are at risk for the adverse effects of passive smoking,"" said Tang Jingyan, a doctor at the Shanghai Children's Medical Center.
""Actually, those young children whose bodies are still growing and developing are more sensitive to the effects of secondhand smoke.""
Research has shown that children who are exposed to secondhand smoke will suffer from more colds, coughs and sore throats, and they are more likely to suffer from bronchitis, pneumonia and will have a higher risk of developing cancer.
Doctors even suggested that children suffering passive smoking are more likely to have behavioral problems and may not develop mentally as quickly as their peers.
Other research by the Shanghai Children's Medical Center has found that more than 80 percent of child patients in the center live in a smoke-filled household, where one or both parents smoke.
""Though doctors have stressed the harm of passive smoking over and over, it is still hard to reach a totally 'smoke free' home,"" said a pediatrician named Zhang Yiwen, noting that parents are often tempted to smoke even though they have learned the harmful effects of secondhand smoke.
China has 540 million people suffering from passive smoke, 180 million of them younger than 15.The age of smokers is also getting lower, earlier reports said.
""There are more young smokers than before.You can see young people wearing a school uniform and carrying a schoolbag light a cigarette on the street.Some of them are even female students,"" said Jing Xingming, a professor of children's developmental behavior at the center.
""Children like to imitate adults, especially their parents.If parents often smoke at home, it is very likely children will develop a smoking habit, which can cause a vicious circle,"" Jin said.
Reports from the Ministry of Health said China has about 350 million smokers, of whom 15 million are underage smokers.Also, around 40 million of the country's 130 million children aged between 13 and 18 had tried smoking, and 15 million had become addicted to tobacco. 
 Question:Which of the following disease may not be connected with secondhand smoking? 
A. Cancer. 
B. Behavioral problems. 
C. Sore throats. 
D. Coughs. 
 Answer: B
Context: The research tracked the health of 101,000 US nurses over three decades.
Light-to-moderate smokers were twice as likely to die of sudden heart problems as those who had never smoked.
But those who quit smoking saw their risk begin to go back down within years, a journal of the American Heart Association reports.
 _ 
During the study, there were 315 sudden cardiac deaths ----where the heart unexpectedly stops working.
In people aged 35 or younger, this usually because of a heart condition that runs in the family.
But in people who are older than this--as most of the nurses in the study were --it can be the first sign of coronary heart disease, where the heart's arteries become blocked by fatty deposits.
Of the 315 sudden deaths in the study, 75 were among current smokers, 148 were among recent or past smokers and 128 occurred in people who had never smoked.
Reason to quit
After taking into account other heart risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and family history of heart disease, Dr Roopinder Sandhu and his colleagues found the women who smoked were twice as likely as likely to die suddenly even if they smoked ""light-to-moderate"" amounts --between one and 14 cigarettes a day.
For every five years of continued smoking, the risk went up by 8%.
But women who quit saw their risk fall to that of someone who had never smoked, after 20 years of cessation.
Dr Sandhu, of the University of Alberta, Canad, said: ""What this study really tells women is how important it is to stop smoking. The benefits in terms of sudden cardiac death reduction are there for all women, not just those with established heart disease.""
""It can be difficult to quit. It needs to be a long-term goal. It's not always easily achievable and it may take more than one attempt.""
Ellen Mason, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""This study shows that smoking just a couple of cigarettes a day could still seriously affect your future health.""
""As we approach the new year, many of us will be making resolutions and giving up smoking will be the top of the list for lots of people.""
""If you're thinking of quitting and need a _ , this research adds to the wealth of evidence that stopping smoking is the single best thing you can do for your heart health.""
A recent study in The Lancet of 1.2million Women found those who gave up smoking by the age of 30 would almost completely avoid the risk of dying early from tobacco-related diseases.
Latest figures suggest a fifth of women in England smoke. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
A. Nonsmokers wouldn't die of sudden cardiac death 
B. Most of the nurses concerned in the research were middle aged. 
C. All age groups of people were involved in the research. 
D. If the smokers had quit smoking, they wouldn't have died of heart disease.

Context: Warm water freezes   more quickly than cold water. Sir Francis Bacon said that almost four hundred years ago. But few people believed him until 1970. In that year Canadian scientist Geoge Kell proved   the English physicist was right. Dr Kell filled one open bowl   with cold water. He filled another with warm water. He put both bowls to the same low temperature. The warm water froze   first.
The lack   of covers on the bowls was the secret  . Some of the warm water changed into vapor.   It evaporated   into the air. This meant that less of the warm water was left to freeze. And so the warm water froze faster than the cold water. 
 Question:Warm vapor can't freeze faster if the bowls are   _  . 
A. full 
B. covered 
C. put outside 
D. changed 
 Answer: B
Context: One Monday morning, Paul and his classmates were in science laboratory for their practical chemistry lesson. The students were going to work in pairs to do an experiment. Before they began, the teacher gave them this description of the different stages of the experiment.
Stage 1: Prepare the equipment: a test tube, a crucible, a Bunsen burner and tongs.
Stage 2: Weigh 5 grams of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and put it in a crucible.
Stage 3: Heat 10 ml of hydrochloric acid   in a test tube.
Stage 4: Pour the warm acid onto the baking soda and continue to heat the mixture.
Result: The acid reacts with the bicarbonate to form water, carbon dioxide gas and salt. The hotter the mixture, the quicker the reaction. Continue to heat the mixture until the water evaporates, leaving the salt in the crucible.
Paul and his partner followed the instructions and set up their equipment. Paul went to the cupboard to get a bottle of hydrochloric acid. He found that there was only one bottle in the cupboard so he took that. There was no label on the bottle and Paul didn't check with the teacher if it was the right solution.
He measured the liquid and poured it into a test tube. Using tongs to hold the test tube, he heated it over the Bunsen burner. That's when things started to go wrong. The liquid in the test tube was not hydrochloric acid. When it was heated, it formed a thick cloud of white gas. Soon the room was full of this strong smelling white gas.
All the students started coughing and their eyes hurt. The teacher immediately opened the windows and ordered the students to leave the laboratory at once. She realized that the liquid was a crylamide   and that it is poisonous.
Fortunately, nobody was injured in the incident. However, it taught the students and the teacher a good lesson. 
 Question:What substance were the students making in the experiment? 
A. Water 
B. Carbon dioxide gas 
C. Salt 
D. Poisonous gas

Context: The oldest and hardest cow beef may be made as tender and tasty as young and choice met. ""This declaration was made by the French physicist Denis Papin in book published in 1681, which described his ""New Digester"" or pressure cooker.  It was a cast iron pot with an air-tight lid, which allowed liquids to boil at a higher temperature than usual, and so it cooked food in a quarter of the time.  The food was cooked by pressurized steam being forced through it at about 121degC.  All pressure cookers were made of cast iron until 1905,  when the first aluminum model was made in America. In 1938, Alfred Vischer, a man from Chicago, U. S. A., designed a simple interlocking pan and lid, and an improved pressure-tight seal --a replaceable rubber sealing ring. When Vischer's patent expired in 1954,  many companies entered the field,  and the rapid pressure cooker became popular with people with people who had little time to cook or had to supply food for unexpected guests.

Context: There are many commonly held beliefs about eye glasses and eyesight that are not proven facts. For instance, some people believe that wearing glasses too soon weakens the eyes. But there is no evidence to show that the structure of eyes is changed by wearing glasses at a young age. Wearing the wrong glasses, however, can prove harmful. Studies show that for adults there is no danger, but children can develop loss of vision if they have glasses inappropriate for their eyes.
We have all heard some of the common myths about how eyesight gets bad. Most people believe that reading in dim light causes poor eyesight, but that is untrue. Too little light makes the eyes work harder, so they do get tired and strained. Eyestrain also results from reading a lot, reading in bed, and watching too much television. However, although eyestrain may cause some pain or headaches, it does not permanently damage eyesight.
Another myth about eyes is that they can be replaced, or transferred from one person to another. They are close to one million nerve fibers  that connect the eyeball to the brain, so it is impossible to attach them all in a new person. Only certain parts of the eye can be replaced. But if we keep clearing up the myths and learning more about the eyes, some day a full transplant may be possible.

Context: Women are friendly. But men are more competitive. Why? Researchers have found it's all down to the hormone oxytocin . Although known as the love hormone, it affects the sexes differently.
""Women tend to be social in their behavior. They often share with others. But men tend to be competitive. They are trying to improve their social status,"" said Professor Ryan.
Generally, people believe that the hormone exytocin is let out in our body in various social situations and our body creates a large amount of it during positive social interaction such as falling in love or giving birth.
But in a previous experiment Professor Ryan found that the hormone is also let out in our body during negative social interactions such as envy.
Further researches showed that in men the hormone oxytocin improves the ability to recognize competitive relationships, but in women it raises the ability to recognize friendship.
Professor Ryan's recent experiment used 62 men and women aged 20 to 37.
Half of the participants received oxytocin. The other half received placebo . [( )] [( :Love my Dog.)] 
After a week, the two groups switched with participants. They went through the same procedure with the other material.
Following each treatment, they were shown some video pictures with different social interactions. Then they were asked to analyze the relationships by answering some questions. The questions were about telling friendship from competition. And their answers should be based on gestures, body language and facial expressions.
The results indicated that, after treatment with oxytocin, men's ability to correctly recognize competitive relationships improved, but in women it was the ability to correctly recognize friendship that got better.
Professor Ryan thus concluded: ""Our experiment proves that the hormone oxytocin can raise people's abilities to better distinguish different social interactions. And the behavior differences between men and women are caused by biological factor that are mainly hormonal."" 
 Question:Why did Professor Ryan conduct the recent experiment? 
A. To test the effect of oxytocin on the ability to recognize social interactions. 
B. To know the differences between friendship and competition. 
C. To know people's different abilities to answer questions. 
D. To test people's understanding of body language.

Context: Have you ever noticed that people have thinner arms and legs as they get older? As we age it becomes harder to keep our muscles healthy. They get smaller, which reduces strength and increases the possibility of falls and fractures  . New research is showing how this happens and what to do about it.
A team of Nottingham researchers has already shown that when older people eat, they cannot make muscle as fast as the young. Now they've found that the ability to prevent muscle breakdown is reduced with age.
When older people eat, they don't build enough muscle with the protein in food; also, the insulin   fails to shut down the muscle breakdown that rises between meals and overnight. Normally, in young people, insulin acts to slow muscle breakdown.
The research just published compared one group of people in their late 60s to a group of 25-year-olds, with equal numbers of men and women. ""We studied our subjects first -- before breakfast -- and then after giving them a small amount of insulin to raise the hormone  to what they would be if they had eaten breakfast,"" Professor Rennie said.
"" The results were clear. The younger people's muscles were able to use insulin we gave to stop the muscle breakdown, which had increased during the night. The muscles in the older people could not. In the course of our tests, we also noticed that the blood flow in the leg was greater in the younger people than the older ones,"" added Professor Rennie. 
However, scientists think that weight training may reactivate muscle blood flow and help retain   muscles for older people. ""In fact, doing exercise three times a week over 20 weeks reactivates the leg blood flow responses of older people. They became identical to those in the young,"" said Professor Rennie. 
 Question:The researchers seemed to believe that   _  . 
A. older people can't make muscles any more 
B. eating fast will help make more muscles 
C. young people make muscles more quickly when eating 
D. older people are not able to stop muscles breakdown

Context: Malaria, the world's most widespread parasitic  disease, kills as many as three million people every year--almost all of whom are under five, very poor, and African. In most years, more than five hundred million cases of illness result from the disease, although exact numbers are difficult to assess because many people don't (or can't) seek care. It is not unusual for a family earning less than two hundred dollars a year to spend a quarter of its income on malaria treatment, and what they often get no longer works. In countries like Tanzania, Mozambique, and the Gambia, no family, village, hospital, or workplace can remain unaffected for long.
Malaria starts suddenly, with violent chills, which are soon followed by an intense fever and, often, headaches. As the parasites multiply, they take over the entire body. Malaria parasites live by eating the red blood cells they infect. They can also attach themselves to blood vessels in the brain. If it doesn't kill you, malaria can happen again and again for years. The disease passed on to humans by female mosquitoes infected with one of four species of parasite. Together, the mosquito and the parasite are the most deadly couple in the history of the earth--and one of the most successful. Malaria has five thousand genes, and its ability to change rapidly to defend itself and resist new drugs has made it nearly impossible to control. Studies show that mosquitoes are passing on the virus more frequently, and there are more outbreaks in cities with large populations. Some of the disease's spread is due to global warming.
For decades, the first-choice treatment for malaria parasites in Africa has been chloroquine, a chemical which is very cheap and easy to make. Unfortunately, in most parts of the world, malaria parasites have become resistant to it. Successful alternatives that help prevent resistance are already available, but they have been in short supply and are very expensive. If these drugs should fail, nobody knows what would come next. 
 Question:It can be inferred from the passage that  _  . 
A. no drugs have been found to treat the disease 
B. the alternative treatment is not easily available to most people 
C. malaria has developed its ability to resist parasites 
D. nobody knows what will be the drug to treat the disease

Context: Tu Youyou, 84, honored with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Oct 5, 2015. She was the first Chinese citizen to win a Nobel Prize in science for her work in helping to create an anti-malaria  medicine.
In 1967, Communist leader Mao Zedong decided there was an urgent national need to find a cure for malaria. At the time, malaria spread by mosquitoes was killing Chinese soldiers fighting Americans in the jungles of northern Vietnam. A secret research unit was formed to find a cure for the illness. Two years later, Tu Youyou was instructed to become the new head of Mission 523. Researchers in Mission523 _ ancient books to find historical methods of fighting malaria. When she started her search for an anti-malarial drug, over 240,000 compounds  around the world had already been tested, without any success.
Finally, the team found a brief reference to one substance, sweet wormwood , which had been used to treat malaria in China around 400 AD. The team isolated one active compound in wormwood, artemisinin , which appeared to battle malaria-friendly parasites . The team then tested extracts  of the compound but nothing was effective until Tu Youyou returned to the original ancient text. After another careful reading, she improved the drug recipe one final time, heating the extract without allowing it to reach boiling point.
After the drug showed promising results in mice and monkeys, Tu volunteered to be the first human recipient of the new drug. ""As the head of the research group, I had the responsibility."" she explained. 
 Question:Which of the following words can best describe Tu Youyou? 
A. Responsible 
B. Traditional 
C. Stubborn 
D. Lucky 
 Answer: A
Context: Before 1900, many theories existed as to the cause of yellow fever  . Some doctors were sure the disease was air-borne; others felt that it was spread from person to person. Dr. Carlos Finlay, a well-known Cuban doctor of that time, had long held the theory that it was caused by the bite of mosquitoes. But neither the public nor the doctors then accepted his idea. 
  Walter Reed,all American doctor sent to study yellow fever in Cuba,went to talk with Finlay.Reed,after reading a lot on the subject,had begun to think that Dr.Finlay might be fight.Then Reed and his comrades set to work at once.Outside Havana,they set up a laboratory and began experiments to test the theory.The experiments were successful.Now we know:A period of about two weeks must pass before a mosquito,after feeding on a sick person,could infect  another person.The sick person had to have yellow fever a certain number of days before the mosquito biting him was able to carry the disease. 
 Question:Reed proved the theory  _  . 
A. in his American lab 
B. by talking with Finlay 
C. in a kind of scientific Way 
D. by reading a lot of articles

Context: Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do. 
 Question:Ray Birdwhistell believes that physical appearance   _  . 
A. has little to do with culture 
B. has much to do with culture 
C. is ever changing 
D. is different from place to place

Context: A previously unknown kind of human group disappeared from the world so completely that it has left behind the merest piece of evidence that it ever existed -- a single bone from the little finger of a child, buried in a cave in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia. 
    Researchers removed DNA from the bone and reported that it differed obviously from that of both modern humans and of Neanderthals , living in Europe until the arrival of modern humans on the continent some 44,000 years ago. 
    The child carrying the DNA line was probably 5 to 7 years old, but it is not yet known if it was a boy or a girl. The finger bone was unearthed in 2008 from a place known as the Denisova cave. 
    Researchers are careful not to call the Denisova child a new human species, though it may prove to be so, because the evidence is initial. 
    But the genetic material removed from the bone, found in a layer laid down on the cave floor between 48,000 and 30,000 years ago, belonged to a distinct human line that traveled out of Africa at a different time from the two known ancient human species. Homo erectus , found in East Asia, left Africa two million years ago, and the ancestor of Neanderthals moved away some 500,000 years ago. The numbers of differences found in the child's DNA indicate that its ancestors left Africa about one million years ago. 
    The region was inhabited by both Neanderthals and modern humans at that time. Counting the new human line, three human species may have lived together. 
The standard view has long been that there were three human resettlements out of Africa -- those of Homo erectus; of the ancestor of Neanderthals; and finally, some 50,000 years ago, of modern humans. But in 2004, archaeologists reported that they had found the bones of small humans who lived on the Indonesian island of Flores until 13,000 years ago, causing a serious problem to this view. The new line is the second such challenge. 
If the nuclear DNA of the Denisova child should differ as much as its mitochondrial  DNA does from that of Neanderthals and modern humans, the case for declaring it a new species would be strengthened. But it would be unusual for a new species to be recognized on the basis of DNA alone. 
In new diggings starting this summer, archaeologists will look for remains more analytical than the finger bone. Researchers will also begin re-examining the fossil collections in museums to see if any wrongly assigned bones might belong instead to the new line.

Context: Since ancient times, people have known about its ability to reduce pain and high body temperature. More than 2000 years ago, the Greek doctor Hippocrates advised his patients to chew on the bark and leaves of the willow.
The tree contains a chemical called salicin . From salicin, researchers in the 1800s discovered how to make salicylic acid . And in 1897, a chemist named Felix Hoffmann at Friedrich Bayer and Company in Germany created acetyl salicylic acid. Later it became the active substance in a new medicine that Bayer called aspirin. The ""a"" came from acetyl. The ""spir"" came from the spirea plant, which also produces salicin. And the ""in"" Well, that is a common way to end medicine names.
In 1982, a British scientist shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in part for discovering how aspirin works. Sir John Vane found that aspirin blocks the body from making natural substances called prostaglandins .Prostaglandins have several effects on the body. Some cause pain and the expansion, or swelling( ; ), of damaged tissue. Others protect the lining of the stomach and small intestine. Prostaglandins also make the heart, kidneys and blood vessels  work well. But there is a problem. Aspirin works against all prostaglandins, good and bad. Scientists learned how aspirin interferes with an enzyme . One form of this enzyme makes the prostaglandin that causes pain and swelling. Another form of the enzyme creates a protective effect. So aspirin can reduce pain and swelling in damaged tissues. But it can also harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine . 
 Question:What can we know about aspirin according to the passage? 
A. Aspirin can treat almost diseases. 
B. Aspirin can create the protective enzyme. 
C. Aspirin can harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
D. Aspirin can protect the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
 Answer: C
Context: Researchers have announced the result of two studies on the health effects of the drug aspirin.One study shows aspirin can sharply reduce the chance that a healthy, older man will suffer from a heart attack.
The study offered two new results from earlier findings, It said taking one aspirin pili every other day helped only healthy men over the age of fifty.It also said aspirin gave the greatest protection against heart attacks to men with low blood cholesterol levels.
Earlier in the United States began a major aspirin study in the early 1980s.It included 22,000 healthy men doctors.Ail were between the ages of forty and eighty-four.More than 11,000 of the doctors took a harmless pill that contained no drug.The men did not know which kind of pill they were taking.
The doctors who took aspirin suffered 44% fewer heart attacks than those taking the harmless pill.139 men who took aspirin suffered from heart attacks.Ten of them died.239 men who did not take aspirin suffered from heart attacks.Twenty-six of them died.
The researchers said the doctors' study provides clear proof that taking aspirin can prevent a first heart attack in healthy, older men.They said, however, the result does not mean every man over the mage of fifty should take aspirin.They said aspirin couldn't help men who do not eat healthy foods, who smoke cigarettes and who are fat.The researchers said men who think they wou3d be helped by taking aspirin should talk with their doctors first. 
 Question:We may learn that the new use of aspirin is   _  . 
A. to treat heart disease 
B. to reduce the chance of a heart attack in old men 
C. to protect old men 
D. to reduce the blood cholesterol levels

Context: A super drug that could remove Alzheimer's  ,heart disease and diabetes   and help people live to 100 is being developed by scientists. Their research is based on the identification of three genes that help prolong lives and prevent diseases which occur in old age. Medically controlling the proteins made by the "" longevity genes"" will allow millions to live longer, predicts Dr Nir Barzilai.
Those whose DNA strongly features the three genes are 80 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer's. The genes also fight against the deadly impact of smoking, poor diet, obesity and lack of exercise.
Already, several laboratories are working on a pill to imitate the benefits of the genes and Dr Barzilai thinks it could be tested within three years. The pill could remove some diseases that damage old age. "" The advantage of finding a gene that involves longevity is that we can develop a drug that will imitate exactly what this gene is doing,"" he said.
Of the three longevity genes, two genes increase the production of so-called good cholesterol , which reduces the risk of heart disease. The third prevents diabetes. They were discovered by Dr Barzilai's team while studying the DNA of 500 Ashkenazi Jews with an average age of 100. The chances of living that long are one in 10,000 but the group, which shared relatively few common ancestors, was 20 times more likely to hit the entury. Dr Barzilai said: "" 30 percent of them were obese or overweight and 30 percent smoked two acks of cigarettes a day for more than 40 years, however they can live to 100.""
But Andrew Ketteringham of the Alzheimer's Society said: ""Alzheimer's disease, a most common disease, is likely to be caused by a combination of genetic disosition , lifestyles and life events. Many genes are probably involved. 
 Question:Why does the discovery of the longevity genes mean a lot? 
A. Because it can bring great benefits to scientific labs. 
B. Because it can help people change their unhealthy genes 
C. Because it helps produce a drug that can make people live longer. 
D. Because it will help scientists build up a new branch of biology.

Context: ""Children should not be left unsupervised   to play with a dog."" say experts in this week's British Medical Journal. Their advice is part of a review aimed at doctors who deal with dog bites.
""Dog bites and maulings are a worldwide problem, particularly in children."" write Marina Morgan and John Palmer. Every year 250,000 people who have been bitten by dogs attend minor injuries and emergency units in the United Kingdom, and half of all children are reportedly bitten by dogs at some time, boys more than girls.
Accurate death figures are difficult to obtain, but in the past five years, two to three cases a year have made news headlines.
Based on the latest medical evidence, _ advise doctors how to examine and treat a patient presenting with a dog bite. They discuss the risk of infection and when to refer to specialist care. For travelers bitten abroad, they suggest assessing the risk of rabies .
In terms of prevention, they suggest that children should be taught to treat dogs with respect, avoid direct eye contact, and not tease them. They should be taught not to approach an unfamiliar dog; play with any dog unless under close supervision; run or scream in the presence of a dog; pet a dog without first letting it sniff you; or disturb a dog that is eating, sleeping, or caring for its babies.
""Dog owners also need to change their behavior"", says Rachel Besser, a children's doctor and lifetime dog owner, in an article.
""It is clear that not all dog owners appreciate that children should not be left unsupervised with a dog"", she says. Just as some parents are obliged to take parenting classes, she would like to see compulsive classes for expectant dog owners to teach them about the responsibilities of dog ownership. Educational programs are also needed to teach children about some precautionary   behaviors around dogs.
Finally, she would like to see animal doctors advising dog owners about bite prevention, and doctors promoting bite prevention when treating patients who have been bitten by dogs.

A. only happens to a few children 
B. should be paid attention to 
C. only boys may meet with

 Answer: D
Context: Learning disabilities are very common. They affect perhaps 10 percent of all children .Four times as many boys as girls have learning disabilities.
       Since about 1970, new research has helped brain scientists understand these problems better. Scientists now know there are many different kinds of learning disabilities and that they are caused by many different things. There is no longer any question that all learning disabilities result from differences in the way the brain is organized.
       You cannot look at a child and tell if he or she has a learning disability .There is no outward sign of the disorder .So some researchers began looking at the brain itself to learn what might be wrong.
       In one study ,researchers examined the brain of the learning-disabled person who had died in an accident .They found two unusual things. One has something to do with cells on the left side of the brain ,which control language. These cells normally are white .In the learning-disabled person, however ,these cells were gray. The researchers also found that many of the nerve cells were not in a line the way they should have been .The nerve cells were mixed together.
       The study was carried out under the guidance of Norman Geschwind, an early expert on learning disabilities. Doctor Geschwind thought that learning disabilities resulted mainly from problems on the left side of the brain .He believed this side of the brain failed to develop normally .Probably ,he said ,nerve cells there did not connect as they should .So the brain was like an electrical device in which the wires were crossed.
       Frank Duffy experimented with this technique at Children's Hospital Medical Center inprefix = st1 /Boston. Doctor Duffy found large differences in the brain activity of normal children and those with reading problems. The differences appeared throughout the brain. Doctor Duffy said his research proves that reading disabilities result from damage to a wide area of the brain, not just the left side. 
 Question:According to the passage we can conclude that further researches should be made to_. 
A. study possible influences on brain development and organization 
B. study how children learn to read and write ,and use numbers 
C. help learning-disabled children to develop their intelligence 
D. explore how the left side of the brain works in language learning

Context: Imagine you're in a dark room, running your fingers over a smooth surface in search of a single dot the size of this period, How high do you think the dot must be for your finger to feel it?
Scientists have determined that the human finger is so sensitive it can detect a surface bump just one micron(l0-6m)""high. The human eye, by contrast, can't tell anything much smaller than100 microns.No wonder we rely on touch rather than eyesight when faced with a new roll of toilet paper.
Biologically, touch is the mother of all sensory  systems.It is an ancient sense in evolution: even the simplest single-celled living things can feel when something brushes up against them and will respond by moving closer or pulling away. It is the first sense aroused during a baby's development and the last to weaken at life's peak. Patients in a deep coma  who seem otherwise lost to the world will show skin reaction when touched by a nurse.
""Touch ,is so central to what we are that we almost cannot imagine ourselves without it,"" said Chris Dijkerman.""It's 'not like eyesight, where you close your eyes and you don't see anything. _ .It's always there.""
Long ignored in favor of the sensory heavyweights of eyesight and hearing, the study of touch lately:: has been gaining new concern among scientists.They're exploring the effects of recently reported false touch impressions, of people being made to feel as though they had three arms, for example, with the hope of gaining the true understanding of how the mind works.
Others are turning to touch for more practical purposes: to build better touch screen instruments and robot hands, a more well-rounded virtual life.. ""There's a fair amount of research into new ways of offloading information onto our sense of touch,"" said Lynette Jones. ""To have your cell phone buzzing (making a low sound) as opposed to ringing turned out to have a lot of advantages in.some situations.""
Touch is our most active sense, our means of seizing the world and experiencing it 'first hand. Dr.Susan Lederman pointed out that while we can become aware of something by seeing or hear,ing7;-.from a distance and without really trying, if we want to learn about something by means of touch, we must make a move.We must rub the cloth, or pet the cat. Touching is a two-way street, and that's not true for seeing or hearing. If you have a soft object and you squeeze it, you change its shape. The physical world reacts back.""
Our hands are smart and can do many tasks automatically - button a shirt, fit a key in a lock, play the; piano for others.Dr.Lederman and her colleagues have shown that blindfolded subjects can easily recognize a wide range of common -objects placed.in their hands.But on some feeling tasks, touch is all thumbs (very clumsy). When people are given a raised line drawing of a common object, they're puzzled.""If all we've got is outline information;"" Dr.Lederman said,.""no weight, no texture, no temperature information, well, we're very, very bad with that.""
Touch also turns out to be easy to fool, Among the sensory tricks now being investigated is something called the Pinocchio illusion. Researchers have found that if they shake the band of the biceps , many people report feeling that their forearm is getting 'longer, their hand floating ever further from their elbow . And if they are told to touch the forefinger of the shaken arm to the tip of their nose, they feel as though their nose was lengthening, too. 
 Question:The sense that is firstly awaked during a child's development is the sense of  _  . 
A. sight 
B. taste 
C. hearing 
D. touch

Context: ""How lucky you are to be a doctor..."" Anyone who's a doctor is right out of luck, I thought. _ 
You may think I want to change my job. Well, at the moment I do. As one of my friends says-even doctors have a few friends-it's all experience. Experience! I don't need such experience. I need a warm, comfortable, undisturbed bed of my own. I need it badly. I need all telephones to be thrown down the nearest well, that's what I need.
All these thoughts fly round my head as I drive my Mini  through the foggy streets of East London at 3:45 a.m. on a December morning. I am a ministering angel in a Mini with a heavy coat and a bag of medicines. As I speed down Lea Bridge in the dark at this horrible morning hour, the heater first blowing hot then cold, my back aching from the car-seat, I do not feel like a ministering angel. I wish I were on the beach in southern France. Call me a bad doctor if you like. Call me what you will. But don't call me at half past three on a December morning for an ear-ache that you have had for two weeks.
Of course, being a doctor isn't really all bad. _ . Once in a while people are ill, once in a while you can help, once in a while you get given a cup of tea and rock-hard cake at two o'clock in the morning-then you worry if you have done everything. But all too often 'everything' is a repetitious rule: look, listen, feel, tap, pills, injection, phone, ambulance, away to the next.
And then there is always the cool, warm voice of the girl on the switchboard of the emergency bed service who will get your patient into hospital for you-the pleasant voice that comes to you as you stand in the cold, dark, smelly, dirty telephone box somewhere in a dangerous section of town. Oh, it has its moments, this life does. 
 Question:From the whole passage we know that the writer   _  . 
A. is a bad doctor, unwilling to make a house call during the night-time

Context: At the time, I would go out in the evening with my parents. But this time I had borrowed a bicycle from a friend of mine. I didn't know why, but once I was on my own bicycle, a kind of free feeling flooded through me. The faster I rode, the faster I wanted to go! Far ahead, I rode as if my life depended on it, head down, hands grasping the handbars. I meant to get to Jinghai Bar as fast as I could. . .
Oh! My hands! Don't come any closer. . . Don't touch me! That poor doctor just couldn't get my gloves off. Each time he took a step towards me, I broke into painful shouting. Much later, I discovered that I had crashed heavily with another bicycle, and I hadn't spoken one word of sense for at least three hours! After some time, my mother arrived at the hospital, her face as white as a sheet, and gave me a hug , only then did the doctor begin to stitch my head wound, not only did he merrily cut off a long lock of my hair, but used no anaesthetic either! Later, I seemed to hear faraway voices saying that my right hand was broken. I almost burst into tears. How would I ever play the piano again? 
 Question:One thing is sure, that is, before she was wounded she  _  . 
A. often went to Jinghai Bar with her friends 
B. liked playing the piano 
C. didn't like any doctors at all 
D. would burst into tears when she was in trouble 
 Answer: B
Context: Rene Descartes' explanation of pain has long been acknowledged in medicine. He proposed that pain is a purely physical phenomenon - that tissue injury makes specific nerves send a signal to the brain, causing the mind to notice pain. The phenomenon, he said, is like pulling on a rope to ring a bell in the brain. It is hard to overstate how deeply fixed this account has become. In medicine, doctors see pain in Descartes' terms-- as a physical process, a sign of tissue injury.
The limitations of this explanation, however, have been apparent for some time, since people with obvious injuries sometimes report feeling no pain at all. Later, researchers proposed that Descartes' model be replaced with what they called the gate control theory of pain. They argued that before pain signals reach the brain, they must first go through a gating mechanism in the spinal cord . In some cases, this imaginary gate could simply stop pain signals from getting to the brain.
Their most _ suggestion was that what controlled the gate was not just signals from sensory nerves but also emotions and other ""output"" from the brain. They were saying that pulling on the rope need not make the bell ring. The bell itself--the mind-- could stop it. This theory led to a great deal of research into how such factors as mood, gender, and beliefs influence the experience of pain. In a British study, for example, researchers measured pain threshold and tolerance levels in 53 ballet dancers and 53 university students by using a common measurement: after immersing your hand in body-temperature water for two minutes to establish a baseline condition, you put your hand in a bowl of ice water and start a clock running. You mark the time when it begins to hurt: that is your pain threshold. Then you mark the time when it hurts too much to keep your hand in the water: that is your pain tolerance. The test is always stopped at 120 seconds, to prevent injury.
The results were striking. On average female students reported pain at 16 seconds and pulled their hands out of the ice water at 37 seconds. Female dancers were almost three times as long on both counts. Men in both groups had a higher threshold and tolerance for pain, but the difference between male dancers and male nondancers was nearly as large. What explains that difference? Probably it has something to do with the psychology of ballet dancers--a group known for self-discipline, physical fitness, and competitiveness, as well as by a high rate of chronic  injury. Their driven personalities and competitive culture evidently accustom them to pain. Other studies along these lines have shown that outgoing people have greater pain tolerance and that, with training, one can reduce one's sensitivity to pain.
There is also striking evidence that very simple kinds of mental suggestion can have powerful effects on pain. In one study of 500 patients undergoing dental procedures, those who were given a placebo  injection and promised that it would relieve their pain had the least discomfort-- not only less than the patients who got a placebo and were told nothing but also less than the patients who got actual drug without any promise that it would work.
Today it is abundantly evident that the brain is actively involved in the experience of pain and is no more bell on a string. Today every medical textbook teaches the gate control theory as fact. There's a problem with it, though. It explains people who have injuries but feel no pain, but it doesn't explain the reverse, which is far more common-- the millions of people who experience chronic pain, such as back pain, with no signs of injury whatsoever. So where does the pain come from? _ .

Context: Doctors in hospital emergency rooms often see accidental poisonings . A frightened parent arrives with a child who swallowed a cleaning liquid. Or perhaps the harmful substance is a medicine. Or it might be a chemical product meant to kill insects. These are common causes of accidental poisoning.
In cases like this, look for medical help as soon as possible. Save the container of whatever caused the poisoning. And look on the container for information about anything that stops the effects of the poison. Save anything expelled   from the mouth of the victim. That way, doctors can examine it.
In the past, some people forced poisoning victims to empty the stomach. They used a liquid syrup of ipecac   to do this. But an organization of children's doctors no longer advises parents to keep syrup of ipecac. The American Academy of Pediatrics says some poisons can cause additional damage when they come back up the throat.
Millions of people know a way to save a person who is choking on something trapped in the throat. The method is commonly known as the Heimlich Maneuver or abdominal thrusts. The American Red Cross says a rescuer should first hit the person on the back five times between the shoulder bones. These back blows may ease the choking. If the airway is still blocked, the Red Cross suggests pushing hard five times along the victim's abdomen. The abdomen is the area between the chest and the hip   bones.

A. Learning the basics of first aid

Context: Scientists say they have discovered a promising treatment for sleeping sickness, a killer disease that infects  about 60,000 people in Africa a year.
British and Canadian experts say drugs could attack the parasite  causing the illness needs to survive. They say the drug could be ready for human medical test in about 18 months.
The disease, spread by the bite of a fly, is caused by a parasite attacking the central nervous system. It has similar symptoms  to malaria , making it difficult to diagnose. Left untreated, it moves to the brain, resulting in mental confusion and final death
The ""breakthrough"" came at the University of Dundee in Scotland, where scientists were offered money to research diseases ignored by major drugs companies.
Professor Paul Wyatt, director of the programme, said: ""This is one of the most significant findings made in recent years in terms of drug discovery and development for ignored diseases.""
He said the research, published in the journal Nature, represented ""significant progress"" in the development of a full blown drug against the disease.
The World Health Organization said there are between 50,000 and 70,000 cases of the disease a year, with a further 60 million people at risk of infection.
The research in Dundee was _ by partners at the University of York in England and the Structural Genomics Consortium in Toronto, Canada. The two drugs currently available to treat sleeping sickness both have problems. One is with side effects that kill one in 20 patients and the other is costly, only partially effective and requires long-time hospital treatment, the scientists said. 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that  _   . 
A. big drug companies play an important role in the research of the new drug 
B. people who get infected with the disease are mentally disturbed 
C. among 200 people infected with the disease, 5 may die because of the old drug 
D. Professor Paul Wyatt may be a professor at the University of York

Context: A single night of taking the drug Ecstasy   can cause serious brain damage and speed up the start of Parkinson's disease , scientists say. Just two or three Ecstasy tablets can permanently destroy brain cells that affect movement and reasoning, according to American research that links the drug to Parkinson's for the first time.
A study by a team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, involving squirrel monkeys and baboons   found that both species suffered permanent damage to key cells, which are lost in Parkinson's, after receiving three low doses of Ecstasy at three-hour periods.
The study is particularly important because baboons are one of the best animal models for the human brain. George Ricaurte, who led the research, said that the widespread abuse of drug might have caused severe damage. ""The most troubling result is that young adults using Ecstasy may be increasing their risk of developing Parkinsonism as they get older.""
Alan Leshner, a former director of the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, said, ""This study emphasizes the multi-aspect damage that Ecstasy causes to users. We've long known that repeated use damages brain cells. But this study shows that even very occasional  use can have long-lasting effects on many different brain systems. It sends an important message to young people: don't experiment with your own brain.""
Janet Betts, a mother whose teenage daughter Leah died after a single Ecstasy tablet in 1995, said, ""This comes as no surprise. But people can't see the effects at first, and they say it won't happen to them. We'll see the symptoms later, just as we have with smoking."" 
 Question:The article is intended to   _  . 
A. explain the bad effects of drugs on people's health 
B. warn young people of the risk of taking the drug Ecstasy 
C. persuade people out of such bad habits as smoking and using drugs

Context: There are various reasons why cancers appear to be on the increase. For one thing, though their sufferers are to be found in all age groups, cancers are particularly likely to attack persons in their middle and advanced years. Naturally, since people live longer these years, there are more cancer sufferers than before. Again, with better methods of diagnosis  , doctors can more easily recognize cancerous growths that would formerly have passed unnoticed or that would have been wrongly diagnosed. It is also believed that certain habits and conditions of modern living, including heavy smoking and the pollution of the air, may leave people living in more cancer-causing conditions than before.
We all look forward to the day when a simple medical test can find cancer while it is still small. Researchers around the world are working on _ . Most of their work deals with the examination of the blood.
Researchers in Boston have found something in the blood of cancer patients that does not appear in healthy persons. The test showed which persons had cancer and which did not. It was correct more than 90 percent of the time.
The researchers believe the test may be able to show cancer very clearly in its development. Cancers discovered early usually can be treated successfully.
The test examines very small bits of fat in the blood called lipids  . Cancers seem to change lipids although doctors do not know why. The test showed differences between the lipids of the persons with cancer and the lipids of those without cancer.
The researchers say the new test could be a step to develop a simple way to check patients for cancer before the disease shows on an X-ray. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. A simple way to cancer 
B. Cancers can be cured 
C. How to find cancer 
D. Early discovery of cancer

Context: Elephants have impressed us for centuries. They are big, clever, and sociable. But what if someone told you that they may also hold the key to fighting cancer?
People have been wondering why elephants do not develop cancer, even though they have life spans that are similar to humans, living for around 50 to 70 years.
Now scientists believe they know why. A team at the University of Chicago, Us has found that elephants carry a large number of genes that stop tumors from developing. To be precise, they found 20 copies of an anti-tumor gene called TP 53 in elephants. Most other species, humans included, only carry one copy.
According to the research, which was recently published on the online science network BioRxiv, the extra copies of the gene improved the animal's sensitivity to DNA damage. This lets the cells quickly kill themselves when damaged before they can form deadly tumors.
""An increased risk of developing cancer has stood in the way of the evolution of large body sizes in many animals,"" study author Dr Vincent Lynch told The Guardian. If every living cell has the same chance of becoming cancerous, large creatures with long life spans like whales and elephants should have a greater risk of developing cancer than humans and mice do. But across species, the risk of cancer does not show a connection with body mass.
 _ was found by Oxford University scientist Richard Peto in the 1970s and later named ""Peto's paradox"". Evolutionary biologists believe it results from larger animals using protection that many smaller do not, In the elephant's case, the making of TP53 is nature's way of keeping this species alive.
The study also found that when the same genes were brought to life in mice, they had the same cancer resistance as elephants. This means researchers could use the discovery to develop new treatments that can help stop cancers from spreading or even developing in the first place.
""Nature has already figured out how to prevent cancer,"" said Joshua Schiffman, an oncologist at the School of Medicine, University of Utah, US.
""It's up to us to learn how different animals tackle the problem so we can use those strategies to prevent cancer in people."" 
 Question:Why are elephants unlikely to develop cancer? 
A. They have a large body size 
B. They carry many genes that keep tumors from developing 
C. Certain genes in their body kill existing tumors

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. ""

Context: The relationship between exercise and cancer has long both intrigued and puzzled oncologists and exercise physiologists.
Exercise is strongly associated with lowered risks for many types of cancer. At the same time, exercise involves biological stress, which typically leads to a short-term increase in inflammation  which can contribute to higher risks for many cancers.
Now, a new study in mice may offer some clues into the exercise-cancer paradox. It suggests that exercise may change how the immune system deals with cancer by boosting adrenaline , certain immune cells and other chemicals that, together, can reduce the severity of cancer or fight it off altogether.
To try to better understand how exercise can both elevate inflammation and simultaneously protect the body against cancer, scientists at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and other institutions decided to closely examine what happens inside mice at high risk for the disease.
So, for the new study, they began by gathering a group of adult lab mice. These animals generally like to run.
The scientists then implanted melanoma   skin cancer cells into the mice before providing half of them with running wheels in their cages while the other animals remained sedentary. After four weeks, far fewer of the runners had developed full-blown melanoma than the sedentary mice and those that had been diagnosed with the disease showed fewer and smaller lesions.
They drew blood from both the exercising and sedentary animals and cells from any tumors in both groups. As expected, they found much higher levels of the hormone adrenaline in the blood of the exercising animals, especially right after they had been working out on the wheels but also at other times of the day. The body releases adrenaline in response to almost any type of stressful experience, including exercise.
They also found higher levels of interleukin-6 in the blood of the runners. This is a substance that is released by working muscles and is believed to both increase and decrease inflammation in the body, depending on where and how it goes to work.
Perhaps most important, they found much higher numbers in the bloodstreams of runners than in the sedentary mice of a type of immune cell named natural killer cells that are known to be strong cancer fighters.
So the scientists repeated their original experiment multiple times, inducing cancer while allowing some mice to run and others to sit. In some of these follow-up experiments, the scientists injected the runners with a substance that blocked the production of adrenaline and gave sedentary animals large doses of added adrenaline.
What they now found was that when running mice could not produce adrenaline, they developed cancer at the same rate as the sedentary animals, while the sedentary animals that had been injected with extra adrenaline fought off their tumors better than other sitting mice.
More remarkably, the scientists determined that adrenaline seemed to be sending biochemical signals to some of the animals' IL-6 cells, making them physiologically more alert, so that when a tumor began to develop in the affected animal, those IL-6 cells in turn activated the natural killer cells in the bloodstream and actually directed them to the tumors, like minute guide fish.
With these results, ""we show that voluntary wheel running in mice can reduce the growth of tumors, and we have identified an exercise-dependent mobilization of natural killer cells as the underlying cause of this protection,"" said Pernille Hojman, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen who oversaw the new study. It perhaps provides one more incentive for us to get up and move. 
 Question:According to the study, we can infer the fundamental substance to fight the cancer off is   _  . 
A. adrenaline 
B. interleukin-6 
C. natural killer cells 
D. genes

Perhaps most important, they found much higher numbers in the bloodstreams of runners than in the sedentary mice of a type of immune cell named natural killer cells that are known to be strong cancer fighters.
So the scientists repeated their original experiment multiple times, inducing cancer while allowing some mice to run and others to sit. In some of these follow-up experiments, the scientists injected the runners with a substance that blocked the production of adrenaline and gave sedentary animals large doses of added adrenaline.
What they now found was that when running mice could not produce adrenaline, they developed cancer at the same rate as the sedentary animals, while the sedentary animals that had been injected with extra adrenaline fought off their tumors better than other sitting mice.
More remarkably, the scientists determined that adrenaline seemed to be sending biochemical signals to some of the animals' IL-6 cells, making them physiologically more alert, so that when a tumor began to develop in the affected animal, those IL-6 cells in turn activated the natural killer cells in the bloodstream and actually directed them to the tumors, like minute guide fish.
With these results, ""we show that voluntary wheel running in mice can reduce the growth of tumors, and we have identified an exercise-dependent mobilization of natural killer cells as the underlying cause of this protection,"" said Pernille Hojman, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen who oversaw the new study. It perhaps provides one more incentive for us to get up and move. 
 Question:In the first experiment, which one is the most important result the scientists found? 
A. Natural killer cells are much more in the bloodstreams of runners than in the sedentary mice. 
B. Levels of interleukin-6 are higher in the blood of the runners than in the sedentary mice. 
C. Exercise such as running seemed to help the mice fight against the cancer. 
D. Adrenaline can reduce the severity of cancer or fight it off. 
 Answer: A
Context: People should go outside and absorb some sunshine to help increase their vitamin D levels, some experts say. Arthritis Research UK. which is a British medical research organization dedicated to curing arthritis  , says vitamin D deficiency can cause bone loss, muscle function problems and, in some cases, rickets   in children.
The government recommends vitamin D supplements   for pregnant women and children aged under five. But on sunny days, a few minutes outdoors should achieve the same results, Arthritis Research UK says.
Figures show that up to a quarter of the population has low levels of vitamin D in their blood and the majority of pregnant women do not take vitamin D supplements. People aged over 65, pregnant and breast-feeding women and children aged six months to five years old are thought to be most at risk.
Vitamin D is essential to help the body absorb calcium   from food. Low levels of vitamin D can result in serious problems.
Alan Silman, the medical director of Arthritis Research UK, said, ""When the days are sunny, go out for a few minutes and expose your face and arms to the sunshine."" But he also had a warning on overexposure. ""Don't allow your skin to go red, and take care not to burn, particularly in strong sunshine and if you have fair or sensitive skin. From June to August, just 15 minutes is generally enough time.""
""In less sunny months,"" Alan Silman added, ""we recommend that people add more vitamin D in their diet by eating more oily fish such as salmon, tuna, and foods rich in vitamin D, such as cereals  ."" 
 Question:Lack of vitamin D may cause the following problems EXCEPT   _  . 
A. bone loss 
B. muscle function problems 
C. rickets in children. 
D. high blood pressure 
 Answer: D
Context: Ever feel like you've been hit on the head after a bad night's sleep? According to scientists, the thought isn't as unbelievable as it seems.
A study found going without sleep for just one night causes changes in the brain similar to those that occur after a blow to the head. The researchers said the healthy young men examined in the study showed a sudden increase in the same chemicals which indicate brain damage. Professor Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, Sweden, explained that the chemicals NSE and S-100B are biomarkers for brain damage, such as concussion . He said, ""What we found was their levels in the blood rose in the group that went without sleep for a night. This was not to the extent that would happen after a head injury, for instance, but it was still significant. During sleep, the brain cleans poisonous substances off itself.""
Benedict also said previous studies which linked a lack of sleep with increased risk of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis could applaud his study. The rise of the chemicals in the blood after sleep loss may suggest not getting enough sleep contributes to a loss of brain tissue, he explained. Benedict, whose study is published in the journalSleep, added, ""In conclusion, the findings of our experiment indicate a good night's sleep may be critical to maintaining brain health.""
A third of the UK population suffer from sleep-related problems, while the average person now sleeps for only seven hours a night, compared with almost nine a few decades ago. Many scientists believe irregular sleeping patterns lead to illnesses ranging from aches and pains to heart disease, while less than eight hours' sleep a night can lower the IQ the next day. 
 Question:What do we know about previous studies? 
A. They found reasons for brain disorders. 
B. Their findings were published inSleep. 
C. They were supported by Benedict's study. 
D. They focused on brain health.

Context: One Monday morning, Paul and his classmates were in science laboratory for their practical chemistry lesson. The students were going to work in pairs to do an experiment. Before they began, the teacher gave them this description of the different stages of the experiment.
Stage 1: Prepare the equipment: a test tube, a crucible, a Bunsen burner and tongs.
Stage 2: Weigh 5 grams of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and put it in a crucible.
Stage 3: Heat 10 ml of hydrochloric acid   in a test tube.
Stage 4: Pour the warm acid onto the baking soda and continue to heat the mixture.
Result: The acid reacts with the bicarbonate to form water, carbon dioxide gas and salt. The hotter the mixture, the quicker the reaction. Continue to heat the mixture until the water evaporates, leaving the salt in the crucible.
Paul and his partner followed the instructions and set up their equipment. Paul went to the cupboard to get a bottle of hydrochloric acid. He found that there was only one bottle in the cupboard so he took that. There was no label on the bottle and Paul didn't check with the teacher if it was the right solution.
He measured the liquid and poured it into a test tube. Using tongs to hold the test tube, he heated it over the Bunsen burner. That's when things started to go wrong. The liquid in the test tube was not hydrochloric acid. When it was heated, it formed a thick cloud of white gas. Soon the room was full of this strong smelling white gas.
All the students started coughing and their eyes hurt. The teacher immediately opened the windows and ordered the students to leave the laboratory at once. She realized that the liquid was a crylamide   and that it is poisonous.
Fortunately, nobody was injured in the incident. However, it taught the students and the teacher a good lesson. 
 Question:Why did the teacher send the students out of the classroom? 
A. Becausethe room was full of this strong smelling white gas. 
B. Because all the students started coughing and their eyes hurt. 
C. Becausethe liquid was a crylamide and that it is poisonous. 
D. Because someone was injured in the incident.

Context: Perhaps it is hard to imagine that a bad tooth could be deadly. But doctors in the Washington area say a twelveyearold boy died last month of a tooth infection that spread to his brain. They say it might have been prevented if the boy had received the dental care he needed.
Experts at the National Institutes of Health say good dental care should start at birth. They say breast milk is the best food for the healthy development of teeth. Breast milk can help slow bacterial growth and acid production in the mouth.
When baby's teeth begin to appear,you can clean them with a wet toothbrush. Dentists say it is important to find soft toothbrushes made especially for babies,and use them very gently.
The use of fluoride   to protect teeth is common in many parts of the world. This natural element is often added to drinking water supplies. The fluoride mixes with enamel ,the hard surface on teeth,to help prevent holes,or cavities from forming.
But the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry points out that young children often swallow toothpaste when they brush their teeth. The group notes that swallowing fluoridated toothpaste can cause problems. So young children should be carefully supervised when they brush their teeth. And only a small amount of fluoridated toothpaste,the size of a green pea,should be used.
Parents often wonder what effects sucking a thumb or sucking on a pacifier might have on their baby's teeth. Dental experts generally agree that this is fine early in life.
The American Academy of Family Physicians says most kids stop sucking their thumbs by the age of four. If it continues,the group advises parents to talk to their child's dentist or doctor. It could influence the correct development of permanent teeth. 
 Question:The boy with a bad tooth died because  _  . 
A. his tooth disease was very deadly 
B. the doctor refused to treat him properly 
C. he didn't receive timely treatment 
D. something was wrong with his brain

Context: A growing number of college students are applying to take entry tests for medical and dental   schools among increasing graduate unemployment in Korea.
""I've decided to apply for the test to enter a medical college to become a doctor, changing from my original plan to prepare for a lawyer qualification exam in order to get a more stable job in the future,"" said a 24-year-old college graduate, Lee, who majored in business administration during his undergraduate schooling.
The new medical and dental school system is getting popularity, attracting an increasing number of students every year since its appearance in 2004, as it is open to all college graduates regardless of their previous majors.
The Education Development introduced the new medical and dental education system, in which college students with bachelor's degrees are allowed to study medicine or dentistry by taking the Medical Education Test (MET) and Dental Education Test (DET).
Ten medical schools and six dental colleges that have used the new system have received 4,377 applications   for the entrance exams.
Applicants are getting younger compared with those in their 20s representing 76.9 percent of the total. The tests might be easier for students with biology and chemistry majors, but graduates from other majors are also applying for the tests.
Under the existing medical and dental education system, students should take a two-year premedical course followed by a four-year medical course.
Students graduating under the new medical or dental education system are given master's degrees, while those graduates who studied under the previous system have bachelor's degrees. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. New Medical and Dental School System Is Carried Out in Korea

Context: Learning disabilities are very common. They affect perhaps 10 percent of all children .Four times as many boys as girls have learning disabilities.
       Since about 1970, new research has helped brain scientists understand these problems better. Scientists now know there are many different kinds of learning disabilities and that they are caused by many different things. There is no longer any question that all learning disabilities result from differences in the way the brain is organized.
       You cannot look at a child and tell if he or she has a learning disability .There is no outward sign of the disorder .So some researchers began looking at the brain itself to learn what might be wrong.
       In one study ,researchers examined the brain of the learning-disabled person who had died in an accident .They found two unusual things. One has something to do with cells on the left side of the brain ,which control language. These cells normally are white .In the learning-disabled person, however ,these cells were gray. The researchers also found that many of the nerve cells were not in a line the way they should have been .The nerve cells were mixed together.
       The study was carried out under the guidance of Norman Geschwind, an early expert on learning disabilities. Doctor Geschwind thought that learning disabilities resulted mainly from problems on the left side of the brain .He believed this side of the brain failed to develop normally .Probably ,he said ,nerve cells there did not connect as they should .So the brain was like an electrical device in which the wires were crossed.
       Frank Duffy experimented with this technique at Children's Hospital Medical Center inprefix = st1 /Boston. Doctor Duffy found large differences in the brain activity of normal children and those with reading problems. The differences appeared throughout the brain. Doctor Duffy said his research proves that reading disabilities result from damage to a wide area of the brain, not just the left side. 
 Question:According to the passage we can conclude that further researches should be made to_. 
A. study possible influences on brain development and organization 
B. study how children learn to read and write ,and use numbers 
C. help learning-disabled children to develop their intelligence 
D. explore how the left side of the brain works in language learning

Context: Alzheimer's disease is a major national health problem. Nearly 2 million Americans over the age of 65 have Alzheimer's disease. It is a leading cause of death among the elderly. But Alzheimer's disease is not confined   to the aged. There may be a million or more people under the age of 65 suffering from the disease.
At one time, people suffering from the disease were said to be ""getting old"". The disease was thought to be a natural part of growing old, but it is now known that Alzheimer's disease strikes young and old alike. It is an organic   disease that destroys brain cells.
Alzheimer's disease affects the patient's memory, speech, and movement. In the beginning stages of the disease, the patient may seem slightly confused. He may have trouble speaking, then the patient's memory begins to fail. He may forget dates, numbers, names and plans.
As the disease progresses, the patient may not recognize family and friends. These symptoms  often cause terrible anxiety in the patient. He may feel lost and frightened. Sometimes the patient reacts with wild and bad behavior.
In the last stages of the disease, the patient may not be able to take care of himself. He may have lost the ability to speak and walk.
Scientists don't know exactly what causes Alzheimer's disease. It may be caused by a virus  .It may be caused by a poisonous substance  in the environment. At present, there is no cure for the disease. But there are ways to slow its progress. Exercise and physical treatment can help the patients of this disease. 
 Question:The main idea of the passage is that Alzheimer's disease   _  . 
A. is a terrible part of the aging process 
B. is an organic disease that affects young and old 
C. can be cured by physical treatment 
D. causes forgetfulness 
 Answer: B
Context: A single night of taking the drug Ecstasy   can cause serious brain damage and speed up the start of Parkinson's disease , scientists say. Just two or three Ecstasy tablets can permanently destroy brain cells that affect movement and reasoning, according to American research that links the drug to Parkinson's for the first time.
A study by a team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, involving squirrel monkeys and baboons   found that both species suffered permanent damage to key cells, which are lost in Parkinson's, after receiving three low doses of Ecstasy at three-hour periods.
The study is particularly important because baboons are one of the best animal models for the human brain. George Ricaurte, who led the research, said that the widespread abuse of drug might have caused severe damage. ""The most troubling result is that young adults using Ecstasy may be increasing their risk of developing Parkinsonism as they get older.""
Alan Leshner, a former director of the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, said, ""This study emphasizes the multi-aspect damage that Ecstasy causes to users. We've long known that repeated use damages brain cells. But this study shows that even very occasional  use can have long-lasting effects on many different brain systems. It sends an important message to young people: don't experiment with your own brain.""
Janet Betts, a mother whose teenage daughter Leah died after a single Ecstasy tablet in 1995, said, ""This comes as no surprise. But people can't see the effects at first, and they say it won't happen to them. We'll see the symptoms later, just as we have with smoking."" 
 Question:The article is intended to   _  . 
A. explain the bad effects of drugs on people's health 
B. warn young people of the risk of taking the drug Ecstasy 
C. persuade people out of such bad habits as smoking and using drugs 
D. tell us the links between the drug Ecstasy and the animal models 
 Answer: B
Context: Scientists in UK have grown a living human ""brain"". The team at Aston University created tiny bunch of cells which act like a mini nervous system.
They believe it could help find a cure for worse mental conditions like Parkinson's disease. Professor Michael Coleman is leading the research program. He explained, ""We are aiming to be able to study the human brain at the most basic level, using an actual living human cell system. Cells have to be alive and operating efficiently to enable us to really understand how the brain works. ""The experiment involves changing cells from a cancer tumour  and making them behave like brain cells.
Although far from finished, researchers hope the false brain cells will give them a greater understanding of how real brains work. This, in turn, could significantly further research into conditions which affect the brain. Neil Hunt, chief leader of the research group, said, ""It is still very early days, but in the future the research could lead to a useful tool for looking into dementia  .""
The technique could also provide a way to carry on animal test and is being supported by the Humane Research Trust (HRT). The scientists predict that over the next ten years a million people will develop dementia. Professor Coleman believes their findings could change this. He said,""We hope our research will provide scientists with a new and highly relational human experimental model to help them understand the brain better and develop new drugs to control the related disease. However, the biggest challenge at present is that we are greatly short of fund, which will slow our research."" 
 Question:The text is intended to   _  . 
A. tell us about a breakthrough in medical research 
B. introduce a research program in human's brain 
C. introduce the progress of drugs for dementia 
D. tell us about health problem in nerve system

Context: Laughter healing  benefits and healing with laughter have become synonymous with Norman Cousins, the man who laughed himself to wellness. Norman Cousins was the editor of SaturdayReviewfor over 30 years.
His story began in 1964, when doctors found that the connective tissue in his spine was becoming worse, which is a condition known as Ankylosing Spondylitis . The doctors, one of whom was a close friend of Cousins, said that his chance of survival was approximately 1 in 500. He read about the theory that negative emotions do harm to the body, so he thought that if negative emotions were damaging to health, then positive emotions should improve health.
Faced with the real possibility of his approaching death, Cousins thought long and hard and eventually did three things completely contrary to medical opinion.
First he began his own research on all of the various drugs he was on. He discovered that his condition was removing Vitamin C from his body and, based on Cousins' personal research, doctors agreed to take him off several of the drugs he was on and inject  him with large doses of this supplement , as Cousins felt this may be his last hope.
Secondly, Cousins made a decision to check out of the hospital and into a hotel room. The third thing Cousins did was get a movie projector  and a large supply of funny films. On his first night in the hotel Cousins found that he laughed so hard at the films that he was able to stimulate chemicals in his body that allowed him several hours of pain-free sleep. When the pain returned he would simply turn the projector back on and the laughter would help sleep, and he was able to measure the changes in his body by measuring his blood sedimentation rate , and found that this rate dropped by at least 5 points each time he watched one of these videos.
The treatment proved to be so effective that in very little time Cousins was off all painkillers and sleeping pills. He found that the laughter relieved the pain and helped him sleep.
He returned to work and wrote about his experimental treatment in his book Anatomy of an Illness. In 1989, it was finally acknowledged in the Journal of the American Medical Association that laughter therapy  could help improve the quality of life for patients with chronic illness and that laughter has an immediate symptom-relieving effect. 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that Norman Cousins   _  . 
A. was born in 1964 
B. had a doctor friend 
C. had once given up on himself 
D. was affected by negative emotions

Context: Many years ago, when I was working as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Lisa. The poor little girl had a very serious disease and was dying. The doctor had done his best but no medicine really worked. The only chance to save her seemed to be a blood transfusion  from her five-year-old brother. The little boy had the same disease before and had developed the antibodies  to fight the illness.
The doctor talked to the little boy about what they planned to do, and asked him if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate  for a moment. He took a deep breath and said, ""Yes, I'll do it if it can save Lisa.""
As the transfusion was going on, the little boy lay quietly in bed next to his sister. He looked at her and smiled all the time. When everything was done and the colour returned to his sister's face, his smile disappeared and he looked a little afraid. He looked up at the doctor and asked, "" Will I start to die now?""

I'm writing because I've understood you've struggled with alcoholism  . I've been fighting mine ever since I went through 9-11. After that, I've been more or less useless. Professionally, I'm a lawyer, and have had to leave my job because I passed out  , drunk in front of my computer. I've taken some medicine and it has helped somewhat. I can manage about a month without drinking, but after that I end up having a crazy stage where nothing matters except drinking. After a week or so of heavy drinking, I start having nightmares of people jumping. After that, it's a week of not being able to get out of bed.
I was supposed to travel to a conference but didn't make it because I got so drunk at the airport that I fell down on my face and spent the rest of the day in the emergency room. I have been hiding from my family since then. Fortunately they won't be expecting me to come back for a week or so. Otherwise, they would notice the bump   on my forehead and two black eyes.
I don't really know what I'm asking you about. Cary, I need a way out that doesn't cause pain to my family. I'm taking medicine, but I still have these attacks every few months. If there's alcohol in the house, I can't stay away from it. It seems that this will never end. I'm worried about what will happen if something bad happens, like a family member dying, or getting fired again. 
Thanks for reading. 
Yours T

Context: Doctors in hospital emergency rooms often see accidental poisonings . A frightened parent arrives with a child who swallowed a cleaning liquid. Or perhaps the harmful substance is a medicine. Or it might be a chemical product meant to kill insects. These are common causes of accidental poisoning.
In cases like this, look for medical help as soon as possible. Save the container of whatever caused the poisoning. And look on the container for information about anything that stops the effects of the poison. Save anything expelled   from the mouth of the victim. That way, doctors can examine it.
In the past, some people forced poisoning victims to empty the stomach. They used a liquid syrup of ipecac   to do this. But an organization of children's doctors no longer advises parents to keep syrup of ipecac. The American Academy of Pediatrics says some poisons can cause additional damage when they come back up the throat.
Millions of people know a way to save a person who is choking on something trapped in the throat. The method is commonly known as the Heimlich Maneuver or abdominal thrusts. The American Red Cross says a rescuer should first hit the person on the back five times between the shoulder bones. These back blows may ease the choking. If the airway is still blocked, the Red Cross suggests pushing hard five times along the victim's abdomen. The abdomen is the area between the chest and the hip   bones. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the text? 
A. Learning the basics of first aid 
B. Accidental poisonings 
C. Common causes of accidental poisoning 
D. Poisonings and first aid

Context: That summer I drank every day, everywhere I went. I had a bottle in my drawer next to me and a bottle next to my bed. I never did another drug, but I drank so much that my family finally asked a priest for help. My father gave me a bottle of medicine for alcoholism that produces unpleasant symptoms when users drink alcohol. I drank while taking it, which made me very sick. And I still drank.
When the priest came, he said, ""Jimmy, doctors said that with your diseases and the amount of drinking you're doing, _ . So your choice is either to stop drinking and live or to continue drinking and die within six months.""
I said, ""I know I can't stop, so guess I'll have to die."" The priest told my family what I said. My little brother-who is like my soul mate, looked at me with tears in his eyes and said, ""But we don't want you to die."" All I could think of was how desperately I had to get out of that room at that moment and have a drink.
But I finally stopped drinking. I was on the care team of my dentist Russell. A lot of people in New York knew him. At the time he was the most famous dentist in the city. He drank heavily and was also with AIDS, so I was selected to be on his care team. Everybody on the team was sober   but me. He went through dementia   and died so quickly before my eyes. I stopped drinking and I've been with the disease for 35 years now. 
 Question:How did the author stop drinking? 
A. The dentist Russell helped him to stop it. 
B. He was persuaded by the dentist Russell's death. 
C. His care team managed to inspire him. 
D. His little brother's soul saved him.

Context: Fat on human body is distributed   in two different ways. Some fat people have a large chest and no waistline  , looking rather like apples. Others are fatter below the waist,  looking more like pears.
      Doctors in Cambridge, England have been examining the relationship between health and fat  distribution. They find that the pear-shaped fat people have fewer problems than the apple-shaped  people. What seems to be most important is not just how much fat you have but where you have it. The doctors measured the apple-shaped women and pear-shaped women and examined them  with X-ray scanners (X). Human beings have two types of fat, one is outside fat that is the fat below the skin and the other is inside fat that lies inside the body. Using the X-ray scanners, the doctors found that the ""apples"" have a large amount of inside fat. If this inside fat is  much more than outside fat, it will probably cause health problems such as obesity  . The best treatment for obesity is to reduce the inside fat. But unfortunately diet treatment  simply makes an apple-shaped person into a smaller apple and a pear-shaped person into a smaller pear. At the moment there is no effective way of reducing the inside fat. 
 Question:The basic reason why some people suffer from obesity is that 
A. they take very little exercise every day 
B. they eat too much 
C. they are examined by X-ray scanners quite often

Context: One baby born with a defective windpipe   now has hope of breathing normally thanks to 3-D printing technology, NPR reported.
Garrett Peterson, now 18 months old, was born with tracheomalacia  , leaving him unable to breathe. The condition terrified his parents, who turned to specialist Dr. Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment.
Along with Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer who runs the university's 3-D printing lab, Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett's windpipe until it's strong enough to function independently. After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the ""splint"" with a 3-D printer.
""It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,"" Green told NPR.
On January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs?
Though he still remains in the hospital, Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery.  His parents are overjoyed, saying he's starting to act more interactive and alert.
As Garrett grows, the splint will expand and eventually dissolve in his body as his own windpipe strengthens enough to work independently.
3-D printing technology has allowed doctors to help patients in ways that they hope will continue to grow.
""We're talking about taking something like dust and converting it into body parts,"" Green said. ""And we're able to do things that were never possible before.""

Context: Starting the day on an egg could keep your blood pressure   under control, research suggests. Scientists have shown that eggs produce proteins with a function similar to that of powerful blood pressure-lowering drugs.
The research, from the University of Alberta in Canada, showed that when eggs come in contact with stomach enzymes   they produce a protein that acts in the same way as  _ , but more work is needed to show the effects outside a lab and in the human body.
Earlier this month, British researchers declared that, contrary to popular beliefs, it is healthy to go to work on an egg.They concluded that the type of cholesterol   found in eggs has little effect on increasing heart disease risks.
Researcher Professor Bruce Griffin, from the University of Surrey, said: ""The wrong beliefs linking egg eating to high blood cholesterol and heart disease must be corrected.The amount of fat in our diet has an effect on blood cholesterol that is several times greater than the  ly small amounts of cholesterol found in eggs.The UK public do not need to be limiting the number of eggs they eat.They can be encouraged to include them in a healthy diet as they are one of nature's most nutritious foods.""
The British Heart Foundation dropped its three-egg-a-week limit in 2005.However, almost half of Britons believe the limit still applies.

Context: Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.
This is an old English saying. Do you know it before? It says that we must go to bed early and get up early in the morning. Then we should be healthy. We should also be rich (wealthy) and clever (wise).
This is true. The body must have enough sleep to be healthy. Children of a young age should have ten hours' sleep every night. Children who don't have enough sleep can't do their work very well. They will not be wise and they may not become wealthy!
The body also needs exercise. Walking, running, jumping, swimming and playing games are all exercise. Exercise keeps the body strong.
Exercise also keeps the blood moving around inside the body. This is very important. Our blood takes food to all parts of our body. The head also needs blood. Exercise helps us to think better!

Context: According to a recent study performed by the Office of Applied Science, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, every day about 3,900 children and teens under the age of 18 try their first cigarette . Among the teens who continue to smoke into their adult years, about one out of three will die as a result of the habit.
Because of the nicotine content in tobacco products, smoking not only becomes a habit for teens, but an addiction . The nicotine in the tobacco is addictive. Once a teen develops the habit of smoking, it is difficult for them to quit without help. The American Lung Association reports smokers who start early in life find it more difficult to quit because of the addiction. 
Teens that smoke often do as a way of dealing with social situations or as a result of pressure from people of their age. The results of a Duke University study show teens with brothers and sisters who smoke are more likely to engage in smoking and other risky actions. The components  of tobacco products have documented  effects on behavior. Nicotine is known to increase fights in teens and adults.
The center for Young Women's Health at the Children's Hospital of Boston states that tobacco products contain about 4,000 chemicals, some of which are poisonous. Breathing these poisons into the lungs quickly affects a teen's entire body. Outward changes include dry, wrinkled skin, yellow teeth and nails, and bad breath. Teen smokers are three times more likely to have bad teeth than non-smokers of their age, the Center further reports. External  effects are often present soon after smoking becomes a habit. 
 Question:What makes people addicted to smoking according to the passage? 
A. The pressure from life. 
B. The feeling of being relaxed. 
C. The good smell of cigarettes. 
D. The nicotine in cigarettes. 
 Answer: D
Context: Do your parents smoke? Where do they smoke - outside, at work or at home when you are around?
According to a survey published in the journal Academic Pediatrics, an alarming number of US parents are still risking their children's lives by smoking in front of them. Half of all children aged 6 to 19, even those with asthma  , have been exposed to second-hand smoke in the country, reported Reuters.
""It's well known that smoking kills, but many smokers still don't realize the damage their smoke causes to those around them,"" Dame Sally, Chief Medical Officer for England, was quoted by the Independent as saying. 
Tobacco smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, hundreds of which are poisonous. About 70 of them can cause cancer, not to mention other diseases, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
What's most scary is that there is no safe level of contact with second-hand smoke---even ""low-level"" exposure can be harmful to one's health. And ""low-level"" means when a parent or family member smokes in another room or even outside. 
While second-hand smoke can be harmful to people of all ages, children face a greater risk than adults: they have smaller lungs; they breathe more quickly; and they have less developed immune  systems. 
Also, young children have little control over their surroundings. Babies can't move to another room because the air is smoky. They depend on the adults in their lives to make sure that their environments are safe. 
Recent years have seen second-hand smoke exposure drop---but for adults rather than kids, because policies have been started around the world to ban smoking in public places such as offices, bars and restaurants. However, ""Children tend to be exposed to second-hand smoke in homes and cars, and these places are not included in most laws and policies,"" Amy Ferketich, a researcher at The Ohio State University, US, told Reuters.
So what can we do to limit children's exposure to second-hand smoke? Parents should stop smoking for good. But if they can't, they should never smoke---or let others smoke---around their children. 
 Question:The drop of second-hand smoke exposure in recent years   _  . 
A. mostly benefits companies rather than families 
B. happened mostly in homes and cars 
C. is because of the rules on low-levels of second-hand smoke 
D. is because of laws that ban smoking in public places 
 Answer: D
Context: Until the twentieth century cigarettes were not an important threat to public health. Men used tobacco mainly in the form of cigars. They chewed tobacco, piped tobacco, and snuffed. Most women did not use tobacco at all.
The cigarette industry began in 1870s with the development of the cigarette manufacturing machine. This made it possible to produce great numbers of cigarettes very quickly, and it reduced the price.
Today cigarette smoking is a widespread habit. About forty-three percent of the adult men and thirty-one percent of the adult women in the United States smoke cigarettes regularly. It is encouraging to note, however, that millions of people have quit smoking. Seventy-five percent of the male population and forty-six percent of the female population have smoked cigarettes for some time during their lives, but twenty-six percent of these men and eleven percent of the women have stopped smoking. The number of persons who have given up smoking is increasing. Men as a group smoke more than women. Among both men and women the age group with the highest proportion of smokers is the age group 24--44.
Income, education, and occupation all play a part in determining a person's smoking habit. City people smoke more than people living on farms. Well-educated men with high incomes are less likely to smoke cigarettes than men with fewer years of schooling and lower incomes. On the other hand, if a well-educated man with a higher income smokes, he's likely to smoke more packs of cigarettes per day.
The situation is somewhat different for women. There are slightly more smokers among women with higher family incomes and higher education than among the lower income and lower educational groups. These more highly educated women tend to smoke more heavily.
Among teenagers the _ is similar. There are fewer teenager smokers from upper-income, well-educated families, and also fewer from families living in farm areas. High school students who are preparing for college are less likely to smoke than those who don't plan to continue their education after high school. Children are most likely to start smoking if one or both of their parents smoke. 
 Question:Which of the following isn't true? 
A. It wasn't until the twentieth century that cigarettes became an important threat to public. 
B. More and more people are giving up smoking. 
C. A poorly-educated woman with lower income is more likely to smoke than a well-educated woman with high income. 
D. There are the most smokers in the age group of 24-44.

Context: If your mother told you to eat carrots so you'd be able to see in the dark, she was right. It turns out that feeding kids carrots is just one of a number of things to keep eyes healthy. Other things include regular eye exams, and sunglasses or hats are also very helpful, experts say.
While eye disease is sometimes hereditary , some are still preventable , said Dr. Ron Weber, an Atlanta-based ophthalmologist. For example, nearsightedness, ""not only has a genetic  component but is also influenced by how kids use their eyes during childhood,"" he told Reuters Health by phone.
He said that extended close work, such as reading, has long been thought to cause nearsightedness. Recent support has come from a study in which people with a higher level of education were more likely to have nearsightedness, because they spend more time reading or working on computers. Another study showed that children who spend more time outdoors are less likely to become nearsighted.
But these findings don't mean kids should be stopped from reading or working on the computer. Instead, Weber suggests, make sure a child's environment is bright enough while they are doing close work. Parents should also help kids get into the habit of holding their reading material at the perfect distance - about 18 to 22 inches, he said. Finally, taking a break every five minutes or so, to let the eyes relax and focus on an object in the distance, will also help.
One of the most important things a parent can do to help _ eye disease and vision problems is to make sure their child gets regular eye exams, beginning early in life. ""The majority of vision problems in children are preventable and treatable,"" said Dr. Ida Chung. 
 Question:Which can be the BEST title for this passage? 
A. Eating carrots 
B. Eye disease 
C. How to keep eyes healthy 
D. The importance of eye health. 
 Answer: C
Context: When we can see well, we do not think about our eyes often. It is only when we can notsee perfectly that we come to see how important our eyes are.
People who are nearsighted can only see things that are very close to their eyes. Many people who do a lot of close work, such as writing and reading, become nearsighted. Then they have to wear glasses in order to see distant things clearly.
People who are farsighted face just the opposite problem. They can see things that are far away, but they have difficulty reading a book unless they hold it at arm's length. If they want to do much reading, they must get glasses too.
Other people do not see clearly because their eyes are not exactly the right shape. This, too, can be corrected by glasses. Some people's eyes become cloudy because of cataracts . Long ago these people often became blind. Now, however, it is possible to operate on the cataracts and remove them.
When night falls, colors become fainter to the eyes and finally disappear. After your eyes have grown used to the dark, you can see better if you use the side of your eyes rather than the centers. Sometimes, after dark, you see a small thing to one side of you, which seems to disappear if you turn your head in its direction. This is because when you turn your head, you are looking at the thing too directly. Men on guard duty sometimes think they see something moving to one side of them. When they turn to look straight at it, they can not see it any more, and they believe they were mistaken. However, this mistake happens because the center of the eye, which is very sensitive in daylight, is not as sensitive as the sides of the eye after dark. 
 Question:We don't know that our eyes are of great importance until   _  . 
A. we think about our eyes 
B. we cannot see clearly 
C. we wear glasses 
D. we have to do much reading

Context: Annealing is a way of making metal softer by heating it and then letting it cool very slowly. If metal is heated and then cooled very quickly , for example by dipping it in water , it will be very hard but also very brittle ---that is , It will break easily. Metal that has been annealed is soft but does not break as easily . It is possible to make metal as hard or as soft as is wished, by annealing it. The metal is heated, and allowed to cool slowly , for a certain length of time. The longer the heated metal takes to cool slowly , the softer it becomes . Annealing can also be used on other materials, such as glass.

Context: One Monday morning, Paul and his classmates were in science laboratory for their practical chemistry lesson. The students were going to work in pairs to do an experiment. Before they began, the teacher gave them this description of the different stages of the experiment.
Stage 1: Prepare the equipment: a test tube, a crucible, a Bunsen burner and tongs.
Stage 2: Weigh 5 grams of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and put it in a crucible.
Stage 3: Heat 10 ml of hydrochloric acid   in a test tube.
Stage 4: Pour the warm acid onto the baking soda and continue to heat the mixture.
Result: The acid reacts with the bicarbonate to form water, carbon dioxide gas and salt. The hotter the mixture, the quicker the reaction. Continue to heat the mixture until the water evaporates, leaving the salt in the crucible.
Paul and his partner followed the instructions and set up their equipment. Paul went to the cupboard to get a bottle of hydrochloric acid. He found that there was only one bottle in the cupboard so he took that. There was no label on the bottle and Paul didn't check with the teacher if it was the right solution.
He measured the liquid and poured it into a test tube. Using tongs to hold the test tube, he heated it over the Bunsen burner. That's when things started to go wrong. The liquid in the test tube was not hydrochloric acid. When it was heated, it formed a thick cloud of white gas. Soon the room was full of this strong smelling white gas.
All the students started coughing and their eyes hurt. The teacher immediately opened the windows and ordered the students to leave the laboratory at once. She realized that the liquid was a crylamide   and that it is poisonous.
Fortunately, nobody was injured in the incident. However, it taught the students and the teacher a good lesson. 
 Question:What substance were the students making in the experiment? 
A. Water 
B. Carbon dioxide gas 
C. Salt 
D. Poisonous gas

 Answer: C
Context: Around the world coral reefs  are facing threats  brought by climate change and great changes in sea temperatures. While ocean warming has been the primary focus for scientists and ocean policy managers, cold events can also whiten corals. A new study by scientists compared damaged to corals exposed to heat as well as cold stress. The results show that cool temperatures can cause more damage in the short term, but heat is more destructive  in the long run.
Climate change is widely known to produce warming conditions in the oceans, but extreme cold-water events have become more frequent and serious as well. In 2010, for example, coral reefs around the world faced on of the coldest winters and one of the hottest summers on record.
During a unique experiment, corals under cold temperatures suffered greater damage in just days compared with heat treated corals. Yet the researchers found that corals were eventually able to adjust to the cold conditions, make their health stable and continue to grow. However, over the long term corals subjected to heat suffered more greatly than those in cold, with evidence of severe whitening and growth stoppage, which leads to death.
The coral's ability to adjust to cool temperatures surprised the researchers, who say the study's results show the complexities  of monitoring coral health in response to different environmental factors .
""Global warming is associated with increases but also decreases of temperatures,"" said Deheyn, one of the researchers. ""Not much has been known about the comparative effects of temperature decrease on corals. These results are important because they show that corals react differently to temperature differences, which is important for future management of coral reefs in the field of climate change."" 
 Question:According to the research,  _  . 
A. corals may continue to grow in cold events after a few days 
B. cold events help corals grow more quickly in a short time 
C. corals show no response to hot temperatures in the first days 
D. corals are whitened mainly because of warm temperatures

Context: If you go to England, you may want to visit Big Ben. Big Ben is not the name of a man but a name of the clock in London. It has a long history of about 150 years. It is at the north end of the Palace of Westminster . The big clock has four faces. So you can read the face of the chock everywhere.The hands of it are about four meters long.When the new year comes, it _ to welcome the start of the new year. There are also many fireworks over the clock tower.
The big clock makes a very loud sound ""Ding dong.Ding dong""-the clock gives the sound every 15 minutes of an hour. 
 Question:Which of the following is True about Big Ben? 
A. It has three faces. 
B. It's in the UK. 
C. It gives the sound every 30 minutes 
D. It is about 200 years old. 
 Answer: B
Context: Light travels at a speed which is about a million times faster than the speed of sound. You can get some idea of this difference by watching the start of a race. If you stand some distance  away from the starter, you can see smoke from his gun before the sound reaches your ears.
This great speed of light produces some strange facts. Sunlight  takes about 8 minutes to reach us. If you look at the light of the moon tonight, remember that the light rays left the moon 1.3 seconds before they reached you. The nearest star is so far away that the light that you can see from it tonight started to travel towards you four years ago at a speed of nearly 2 million km. per minute. In some cases, the light from one of tonight's stars had started on its journey to you before you were born.
Thus, if we want to be honest, we can't say, ""The stars are shining tonight."" We have to say instead, ""The stars look pretty. They were shining four years ago, but their light has only just reached the earth."" 
 Question:Light speed is   _   sound speed. 
A. as fast as 
B. a million times slower than 
C. about millions of times faster than 
D. about a million times faster than

Context: A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations.
Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital.
Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. ""We were desperate,"" said Matouk.
The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. ""We are very satisfied with the results,"" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital.
Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians in transplant surgery at the Royal Liverpool. ""Funding is a problem,"" said Hammad. ""In the meantime we'll go back as volunteers to Gaza for the next couple of years to do more transplants."" The Liverpool team's next visit is scheduled for May. 
 Question:What is the beginning of the cooperation between the Royal Liverpool hospital and Gaza? 
A. A UK doctor contacted Gaza hospital. 
B. The Shifa imported medical machines from UK. 
C. Ziad Matouk's condition seemed to get worse. 
D. A Shifa doctor turned to Royal Liverpool hospital for help.

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. ""

A. a close friend

By the time you are through the security doors and into the emergency area, that sample could have been sent through to the lab by vacuum tube and analysed by a machine which automatically feeds a preparative result into the clinical database. 
Less than a minute after the sample is processed, the doctors can see the results through the monitors beside every position in the emergency suites. 
As you are being wheeled in, you may notice cameras in the ceiling. The hospital has spent $4 million on its camera security system to protect staff and patients. 
When you come to in the neighbouring Admission and Planning Unit, the clinician  may be looking at all your records, x-rays and even documents sent in by your GP on a Compaq tablet PC wirelessly connected to the network by an 802.11 ""WiFi"" card.

Context: Alzheimer's disease is a major national health problem. Nearly 2 million Americans over the age of 65 have Alzheimer's disease. It is a leading cause of death among the elderly. But Alzheimer's disease is not confined   to the aged. There may be a million or more people under the age of 65 suffering from the disease.
At one time, people suffering from the disease were said to be ""getting old"". The disease was thought to be a natural part of growing old, but it is now known that Alzheimer's disease strikes young and old alike. It is an organic   disease that destroys brain cells.
Alzheimer's disease affects the patient's memory, speech, and movement. In the beginning stages of the disease, the patient may seem slightly confused. He may have trouble speaking, then the patient's memory begins to fail. He may forget dates, numbers, names and plans.
As the disease progresses, the patient may not recognize family and friends. These symptoms  often cause terrible anxiety in the patient. He may feel lost and frightened. Sometimes the patient reacts with wild and bad behavior.
In the last stages of the disease, the patient may not be able to take care of himself. He may have lost the ability to speak and walk.
Scientists don't know exactly what causes Alzheimer's disease. It may be caused by a virus  .It may be caused by a poisonous substance  in the environment. At present, there is no cure for the disease. But there are ways to slow its progress. Exercise and physical treatment can help the patients of this disease.

As a result, he started suffering a serious pain in the neck around June or July. What's worse the pain has spread to the hand and back gradually, which makes his mother Mehzabin become concerned.
The doctors note the number of young children with the chronic pain  in their necks, arms and shoulders is on the increase sharp in recent years . They are not aging, they haven't had an accident, the blood reports are fine, their X-rays are fine, and their MRIs are fine. Facts have proved that the pain is from the poor posture  while they are playing video games on smart phones or other electronic devices. 19-year -old student Nida feels pain in the finger which holds the weight of her smart phone most of the day. Nida almost uses her smart phone 24/7, which means 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or all the time.
Health experts predict there will be not only physical but mental  problems resulting from the overuse of electronic devices. They encourage people to often take breaks and exercise from using computers, smart phones or other devices. Stand up! Stretch  the legs, back, shoulders and arms in all the possible directions. That's the most effective way and maybe the key to solving the problem completely. After all, the medication doesn't help sometimes. 
 Question:What may be the best title for the text? 
A. To Play Games Well, Sit Up Straight 
B. Too Much Gaming Is A Pain In The Neck 
C. How To Avoid The Pain In The Neck 
D. How To Be More Fit By Playing Games

Context: A Concussion  happens when the brain is shaken, often in a car crash or a fall or a strike on; the head in sports.Concussions can be mild, but doctors may order a CT scan to look for a more serious injury.But a recent study warned that more children than necessary are being exposed  to radiation this way.
A national team led by two doctors at the University of California, Davis, studied hospital records from thousands of children with head injuries. They found that in many cases, the risk of developing cancer from the radiation outweighed the risk of a serious brain injury.
The study found that one in five children over age two had a low risk of serious injury but received CT scans anyway. The same was true of almost one in four children under two years of age.
The researchers have developed rules to predict if a head injury is serious enough for a scan. For children under two, doctors are advised against it if there is:
*Normal mental activity.
*No swelling in the back of the head.
*No feeling of a broken bone in the skull.  
*And no loss of consciousness for more than five seconds.
Doctors should also consider how the child was injured and whether the parents say the child is acting normally.
For patients from two to eighteen, the guidelines are similar ---- except there should be no l vomiting and no severe headache.
Earlier this year, the British Journal of Sports Medicine published new guidelines for concussions in children and teens. International experts said they should not return to sports or school until fully recovered. The brain also needs a ""cognitive rest,"" they say, by restricting activities like video games, texting and watching TV.
It often take longer than adults to recover from a concussion than adults. The experts say individual progress and not a set time period should always guide a decision to return to play. 
 Question:How many aspects should doctors consider when deciding whether a child under two needs a CT scan? 
A. Four. 
B. Six. 
C. Seven. 
D. Nine.

Context: Medical drugs sometimes cause more damage than they cure. One solution to this problem is to put the drugs inside a capsule, protecting them from the body--and the body from them--until they can be released at just the right spot. There are lots of ways to trigger   this release, including changing temperature, acidity, and so on. But triggers can come with their own risks--burns, for example. Now, researchers in California have designed what could be a harmless trigger to date: shining near-infrared light (NIR, ) on the drug in the capsule.
The idea of using light to liberate the drug in the capsule isn't new. Researchers around the globe have developed polymers   and other materials that begin to break down when they absorb either ultraviolet (UV, ) or visible light. But tissues also readily absorb UV and visible light, which means the drug release can be triggered only near the skin, where the light can reach the capsule. NIR light largely passes through tissues, so researchers have tried to use it as a trigger. But few compounds   absorb NIR well and go through chemical changes.
That changed last year when Adah Almutairi, a chemist at the University of California, San Diego, reported that she and her colleagues had designed a polymer that breaks down when it absorbs NIR light. Their polymer used a commercially available NIR-absorbing group called o-nitrobenzyl (ONB). When they catch the light, ONB groups fall off the polymer, leading to its breakdown. But ONB is only a so-so NIR absorber, and it could be poisonous to cells when it separates from the polymer.
So Almutairi and her colleagues reported creating a new material for capsules that's even better.This one consists of a long chain of compounds called cresol groups linked in a polymer. Cresol contains reactive  components that make it highly unstable in its polymeric form, a feature Almutairi and her colleagues use to their advantage. After polymerizing the cresols, they cap each reactive component with a light-absorbing compound called Bhc. When the Bhcs absorb NIR light, the reactive groups are exposed and break the long polymer into two short chains. Shining additional light continues this breakdown, potentially releasing any drugs in the capsule. What's more, Almutairi says, Bhc is 10 times better at absorbing NIR than is ONB and is not poisonous to cells. 
 Question:Which word can be used to complete the following process of changes? 
A. protected 
B. formed 
C. exposed 
D. combined

Context: World Health Day is celebrated on 7 April to mark the anniversary of the founding of WHO in 1948. Each year a theme is selected for World Health Day that highlights a priority area of public health concern in the world.
The theme for 2013 is high blood pressure. High blood pressure increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes . If left uncontrolled, high blood pressure can also cause blindness, irregularities of the heartbeat and heart failure. The risk of developing these complications is higher in the presence of other risk factors such as diabetes . One in three adults worldwide has high blood pressure and this increases with age, from 1 in 10 people in their 20s and 30s to 5 in 10 people in their 50s. High blood pressure is most common in some low-income countries in Africa, with over 40% of adults in many African countries thought to be affected.
However, high blood pressure is both preventable and treatable. In some developed countries, prevention and treatment of it has brought about a reduction in deaths from heart disease. The risk of developing high blood pressure can be reduced by: reducing salt intake; eating a balanced diet; avoiding harmful use of alcohol; taking regular physical activity; keeping a healthy body weight; and avoiding tobacco use.
The final and most important goal of World Health Day 2013 is to reduce heart attacks and strokes, which includes as follows:
1.to raise awareness of the causes and consequences of high blood pressure;
2.to provide information on how to prevent high blood pressure
3.to encourage adults to check their blood pressure and to follow the advice of health-care professionals. 
 Question:Which of the following can NOT reduce the risk of developing high blood pressure? 
A. Less salt intake 
B. Putting on weight 
C. Regular exercise 
D. No smoking 
 Answer: B
Context: Most people in America live in small family groups. More than a quarter of homes in America have only got one person in them.

Context: Why do men die earlier than women? The latest research makes it known that the reason could be   that men's hearts go into rapid decline when they reach middle age.
  The largest study of the effects of aging on the heart has found that women's  _ may be    linked to the fact that their hearts do not lose their pumping power with age.
  ""We have found that the power of the male heart falls by 20-25 percent between 18 and 70 years of age,"" said the head of the study, David Goldspink of Liverpool John Moores University in the UK.
  ""Within the heart there are millions of cells that enable it to beat. Between the age of 20 and 70, one-third of those cells die and are not replaced in men,"" said Goldspink. ""This is part of the aging   process.""
  What surprises scientists is that the female heart sees very little loss of these cells. A healthy     70-year-old woman's heart could perform almost as well as a 20-year-old one's.
  ""This gender difference might just explain why women live longer than men,"" said Goldspink. They studied more than 250 healthy men and women between the ages of 18 and 80, focusing on healthy  persons to remove the confusing influence of disease. ""The team has yet to find why aging takes a    greater loss on the male heart,"" said Goldspink.
  The good news is that men can improve the health of their heart with regular exercise. Goldspink  stressed that women also need regular exercise to prevent their leg muscles becoming smaller and       weaker as they age. 
 Question:If you want to live longer, you should   _  . 
A. enable your heart to beat much faster 
B. find out the reason for aging 
C. exercise regularly to keep your heart healthy 
D. prevent your cells from being lost

Context: A new study shows that fat people in the United States suffer direct economic and social effects because of their size. The findings are from an 8-year study of about 100,000 people. The people who were studied were between the age of 18 and 24 when the research began.
The researchers who carried out the study say they consider the people fat if they are in the top of 5% of the measurement in which weight is linked to height. For example, fat women in the study were about 160 centimeters tall and weighed about 90 kilograms. Fat men in the study were about 175 centimeters tall and weighed 100 kilograms. The researchers say that more than 1,000,000 Americans are that big. The researchers found that fat young women were from wealthy families. The fat women also were 20% less likely to get married and they earned an average of about $6,700 a year less than other women. The study showed less
effects on fat men. They earned an average of about $3,000 a year less than other men. Fat men also were 11% less likely to get married. 
 Question:The researchers consider the people fat if    _   . 
A. they eat lots of food and do less exercise 
B. they are fatter than others 
C. they are in the top of 5% of the measurement of weight 
D. they are in the top of the measurement in which weight is linked to height.

Context: Doctors in hospital emergency rooms often see accidental poisonings . A frightened parent arrives with a child who swallowed a cleaning liquid. Or perhaps the harmful substance is a medicine. Or it might be a chemical product meant to kill insects. These are common causes of accidental poisoning.
In cases like this, look for medical help as soon as possible. Save the container of whatever caused the poisoning. And look on the container for information about anything that stops the effects of the poison. Save anything expelled   from the mouth of the victim. That way, doctors can examine it.
In the past, some people forced poisoning victims to empty the stomach. They used a liquid syrup of ipecac   to do this. But an organization of children's doctors no longer advises parents to keep syrup of ipecac. The American Academy of Pediatrics says some poisons can cause additional damage when they come back up the throat.
Millions of people know a way to save a person who is choking on something trapped in the throat. The method is commonly known as the Heimlich Maneuver or abdominal thrusts. The American Red Cross says a rescuer should first hit the person on the back five times between the shoulder bones. These back blows may ease the choking. If the airway is still blocked, the Red Cross suggests pushing hard five times along the victim's abdomen. The abdomen is the area between the chest and the hip   bones.

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle?

Context: We can slow down aging. That is the message Dr. Shen Ziyin wants to give the world. And the Chinese doctor claims that he has found an answer to the problems of aging. His solution is a herbal medicine to slow the process of aging.
Dr. Shen Ziyin has been trained in Western medicine. At the same time he studied traditional Chinese medicine. And, he has been working for the past forty years to put together the best of both and find a cure for aging. He has taken a hint from the ancient Chinese medicine system called ""Shen"".
According to Shen, it is the kidney which adjusts the functioning of the body as well as its aging process. It is responsible for the level of activity that the human bodies go through. Studies conducted by Dr. Shen show that herbal medicine based on the Shen system slows the aging process, says a report in the Telegraph newspaper. We notice that when people grow old, they have reduced strength, loss of hair, backache, weakness, wrinkles and so on. This happens because when people grow old, their bodies produce T-cells. These T-cells contain a particular substance called Fas. Fas makes the cells in the body destruct themselves.
So the only way to slow down aging is to slow the production of T-cells in the body. This can happen if people eat low calorie food. Then the body is not active enough to produce extra T-cells. But, is going hungry all the time a good price to pay for staying young? This is where Dr. Shen's herbal medicine comes in. But how effective it will be, only time can tell. 
 Question:What plays the most important role in keeping people young according to Shen? 
A. Medical treatment. 
B. People's good kidney 
C. Positive life attitude. 
D. Level of people's activity. 
 Answer: B
Context: If you were asked what your body is made of, probably you would say that it is made of flesh  and bones and covered with skin. You also know something about the blood which flows through it, and that there is a very important part which we call the brain.
But the flesh and the bones make up the largest part of the body, and there is a good deal to be learned about them. You know the general appearance of both flesh and bone from the parts of animals which you see in the butcher's shop.
Bone is hard, and of a white color; indeed, it looks more like a piece of wood or stone than a part of a living animal. But bone is a real part of the living body, and it grows and is nourished  just as the body is. If a man breaks the bone of his arm or his leg, it is firmly bound up, to prevent the broken parts from moving out of the proper places, and in time then bone grows together again and becomes quite strong.
The bones are fastened together by various kinds of joints . They form the framework of the body, and give it strength to retain its proper shape. This framework is called the skeleton . Some animals, such as worms and slugs, have no skeleton; and others, such as shellfish, have a kind of hard covering or skeleton outside.
The most important part of the skeleton is the backbone. It is so important that naturalists divide all animals into two classes,--- those which have a backbone and those which have none. All the higher animals, including man, have a backbone, or vertebral column as it is called. They are therefore called vertebrate  animals. The others are called invertebrate animals. 
 Question:From the passage, we know higher animals are called  _  . 
A. backbone 
B. human beings 
C. vertebrate animals 
D. skeleton

Most sports have some kind of running or jumping So experts at many shoe companies work hard to design good sport shoes. First, a designer enters a plan for a shoe into a computer .Engineers then improve the design. A second computer designs a model for the shoe. Then a few pairs are made. Next, the shoe is tested.
Different kinds of sports shoes are made for different uses. Some are made to help marathon  runners save energy during a race. Some are made for the stop-and-go kind of running tennis players. But all sport shoes have one thing in common: they are designed to help people's feet comfortable during sports. Today, nearly every sport has its own special shoe designed for just the kind of running that sport needs.

Context: For centuries, medical pioneers have refined a variety of methods and medicines to treat sickness, injury, and disability, enabling people to live longer and healthier lives.
""A salamander (a small lizard-like animal) can grow back its leg. Why can't a human do the same?"" asked Peruvian-born surgeon Dr. Anthony Atala in a recent interview. The question, a reference to work aiming to grow new limbs for wounded soldiers, captures the inventive spirit of regenerative medicine. This innovative field seeks to provide patients with replacement body parts.
These parts are not made of steel; they are the real things --- living cells, tissue, and even organs.
Regenerative medicine is still mostly experimental, with clinical applications limited to procedures such as growing sheets of skin on burns and wounds. One of its most significant advances took place in 1999,when a research group at North Carolina's Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine conducted a successful organ replacement with a laboratory-grown bladder. Since then, the team, led by Dr. Atala, has continued to generate a variety of other tissues and organs  from kidneys to ears.
The field of regenerative medicine builds on work conducted in the early twentieth century with the first successful transplants of donated human soft tissue and bone. However, donor organs are not always the best option. First of all, they are in short supply, and many people die while waiting for an available organ; in the United States alone, more than 100,000 people are waiting for organ transplants. Secondly, a patient's body may ultimately reject the transplanted donor organ. An advantage of regenerative medicine is that the tissues are grown from a patient's own cells and will not be rejected by the body's immune system.
Today, several labs are working to create bioartificial body parts. Scientists at Columbia and Yale Universities have grown a jawbone and a lung. At the University of Minnesota, Doris Taylor has created a beating bioartificial rat heart. Dr. Atala's medical team has reported long-term success with bioengineered bladders implanted into young patients with spina bifida (a birth defect that involves the incomplete development of the spinal cord). And at the University of Michigan, H. David Humes has created an artificial kidney.
So far, the kidney procedure has only been used successfully with sheep, but there is hope that one day similar kidney will be implantable in a human patient. The continuing research of scientists such as these may eventually make donor organs unnecessary and, as a result, significantly increase individuals' chances of survival. 
 Question:Why is generative medicine considered innovative? 
A. It will provide patients with replacement soft tissues. 
B. It will strengthen the human body's immune system. 
C. It will shorten the time patients waiting for a donated organ. 
D. It will make patients live longer with bioartificial organs.

Context: Since ancient times, people have known about its ability to reduce pain and high body temperature. More than 2000 years ago, the Greek doctor Hippocrates advised his patients to chew on the bark and leaves of the willow.
The tree contains a chemical called salicin . From salicin, researchers in the 1800s discovered how to make salicylic acid . And in 1897, a chemist named Felix Hoffmann at Friedrich Bayer and Company in Germany created acetyl salicylic acid. Later it became the active substance in a new medicine that Bayer called aspirin. The ""a"" came from acetyl. The ""spir"" came from the spirea plant, which also produces salicin. And the ""in"" Well, that is a common way to end medicine names.
In 1982, a British scientist shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in part for discovering how aspirin works. Sir John Vane found that aspirin blocks the body from making natural substances called prostaglandins .Prostaglandins have several effects on the body. Some cause pain and the expansion, or swelling( ; ), of damaged tissue. Others protect the lining of the stomach and small intestine. Prostaglandins also make the heart, kidneys and blood vessels  work well. But there is a problem. Aspirin works against all prostaglandins, good and bad. Scientists learned how aspirin interferes with an enzyme . One form of this enzyme makes the prostaglandin that causes pain and swelling. Another form of the enzyme creates a protective effect. So aspirin can reduce pain and swelling in damaged tissues. But it can also harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine . 
 Question:What can we know about aspirin according to the passage? 
A. Aspirin can treat almost diseases. 
B. Aspirin can create the protective enzyme. 
C. Aspirin can harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
D. Aspirin can protect the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
 Answer: C
Context: When Elizabeth Kenny was a little girl, she fell off a horse and hurt her arm. Mrs. Kenny took her to a doctor in Toowoomba, Queensland. In the doctor's, Elizabeth saw many bottles of medicine standing in a row. Since then, she wanted to be a nurse. As soon as she was old enough, Elizabeth was trained in a hospital. After working for some time, she made a surprising discovery. Among her patients were some children who had lost the use of their legs because of polio ( ) . Kenny tried putting hot cloth on their legs and washing them in a special way. The results were great. The children were able to use their legs again.
Most doctors would not believe that children could get well in such a simple way. Gradually, however, she became famous. From 1993 on people from many parts of the world brought their children to Australia to receive treatment by this wonderful nurse. She was invited to America where her methods were used in many hospitals. Money was collected to build Kenny foundations which were for polio patients. Kenny died in 1952, but she will long be remembered for her fight against polio. 
 Question:The best title   of the text is most likely to be   _  . 
A. Methods of Treating Polio 
B. Kenny Foundations for Children 
C. Elizabeth Kenny, the Wonderful Nurse 
D. Hospitals for Polio Patients

Context: Every year, World Blood Day is celebrated by blood services worldwide on 14 June, the birthday of Nobel Prize winner Karl Landsteiner, the man who discovered the ABO blood group system. If you have every thought of becoming a blood donor, just register to do it. And you should never worry about the donation.
Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body.
It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients.
First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday.
Although most people are able to give blood, some people who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease are no tasked to be donors. Pregnant women or those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood.
Blood has a very short shelf life. Some blood components can be kept longer than others, for instance red blood cells will keep for 35 days but platelets for only five. Remember, you should wait at least 16 weeks before donating blood again. 
 Question:What component of blood is used to treat burned patients? 
A. Plasma 
B. Red blood cell 
C. Antibody 
D. White blood cell

Context: It's impossible to determine how many people would have lost their lives without the contribution of African-American inventor Dr Charles Drew.
Charles Drew was born on June 3, 1904, in Washington, DC. His early interest was in education, but he was also an outstanding athlete. While in college, he was awarded as the man who contributed the most to sports during his four years in school. Drew's sister Elsie suffered from tuberculosis  and died in 1920. Her death influenced his decision to study medicine.
After becoming a doctor and working as a college instructor, Drew went to Columbia University, where he earned his Doctor of Medical Science degree. During this time he became involved in research on blood and blood transfusions.
At Columbia, he wrote a paper on ""banked blood"", in which he described a technique he developed for the long-term preservation of blood plasma. Before his discovery, blood could not be stored for more than two days because of the rapid breakdown of red blood cells. Drew had discovered that by separating the plasma from the whole blood and then refrigerating them separately, they could be combined a week later for a blood transfusion. Drew became the first African American to receive a PhD in medical science.
After World War II broke out, Drew was called upon to put his techniques into practice. He was named a project director for the American Red Cross but soon quit his post after the government issued an order that blood taken from white donors should be separated from that of black donors.
On April 1, 1950, after he attended the annual free clinic at the John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, he and other three physicians decided to drive back home. As he was tired from spending the night before in the operating room, he lost control of his car. Drew was badly injured and was taken to Alamance General Hospital in Burlington, North Carolina. He was pronounced dead half an hour after he first received medical attention. Drew's funeral was held on April 5, 1950, at the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church in Washington, DC.
But contrary to popular thought, he was not refused a blood transfusion by an all-white hospital. He indeed received a transfusion but was beyond the help of the doctors attending to him. As Dr. John Ford, one of the doctors who survived the accident, later explained, ""We all received the very best of care. The fact that he was a Black did not in any way limit the care that was given to him."" Over the years, Drew has been considered one of the most honored figures in the medical field. 
 Question:According to the passage,   _   might have contributed to the invention of blood banks. 
A. the combination of blood cells 
B. the rapid breakdown of red blood cells 
C. the development of refrigerating technique 
D. the technique of separating plasma from the whole blood 
 Answer: D
Context: Many years ago, when I was working as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Lisa. The poor little girl had a very serious disease and was dying. The doctor had done his best but no medicine really worked. The only chance to save her seemed to be a blood transfusion  from her five-year-old brother. The little boy had the same disease before and had developed the antibodies  to fight the illness.
The doctor talked to the little boy about what they planned to do, and asked him if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate  for a moment. He took a deep breath and said, ""Yes, I'll do it if it can save Lisa.""
As the transfusion was going on, the little boy lay quietly in bed next to his sister. He looked at her and smiled all the time. When everything was done and the colour returned to his sister's face, his smile disappeared and he looked a little afraid. He looked up at the doctor and asked, "" Will I start to die now?""
He was too young to understand the doctor. He thought he would have to give all his blood to his sister, but he agreed. 
 Question:What did the boy feel when the doctor talked to him about the transfusion? 
A. He was unhappy to help his sister. 
B. He was so afraid that he refused to do anything. 
C. He was worried about his sister. 
D. He was willing to give his blood.

Context: During the day we work and play,and at night we sleep. Our body rests when we sleep. In the morning we are ready to work and play again. Our body grows most when we are asleep. Children who are tired usually need sleep. We can get better at our lessons after having plenty of rest. Boys and girls who are eight or nine years old need ten hours of sleep every night. Our body needs plenty of air when we are asleep. If we do not get enough fresh air, we will feel tired when we wake up. While in bed we must not cover our head,our lungs need to get enough fresh air. If we open our windows at night,we can have plenty of fresh air. Cool air is better than warm air. 
 Question:What do the lungs need most? 
A. Fresh air. 
B. Exercise. 
C. Warm air. 
D. Cold air. 
 Answer: A
Context: Air is always around us. It is around us when we walk and play. From the time we are born, air is around us. When we sit down, it is around us. When we go to bed, air is also around us. We live in air.
All the animals and plants need air. Living things can't live without air. We can live without food or water for a few days, but we can not live for more than a few minutes without air. We breathe in air. When we are walking or running, we need more air. When we are asleep, we need less air.
We live in air, but we can't see it. We can only feel it. We can feel it when it is moving. Moving air is called wind. How can we make air move? Here is one way. Hold and open a book in you hand in front of your face. Close it quickly! What you feel is the air. 
 Question:Which of the following sentences is TRUE ? 
A. Sometimes we don't live in air. 
B. Air is not around us when we go to bed. 
C. We can live happily without air. 
D. We need more air when we are working or running. 
 Answer: D
Context: People who are worried about bad breath often reach for a toothbrush or a gun. But in the future, personal breath monitoring may include far more than fresh breath.
In face, breath is so rich in chemical compounds that fully understanding it has proved challenging. Each breath contains gases like carbon dioxide, the volatile remains of recent snacks, medicines and even compounds taken in from things like carpeting or various kinds of air pollution. But breath detectors  can sort out these substances with increasing sensitivity . 
Scientists are building electronic sniffers that examine the exhaled air for signs of cancer, asthma , and other diseases.
""There are clear signatures in the breath for liver disease, kidney disease and heart disease. Breath is a rich mixture that can reflect out state of health and disease."" said Dr. Raed Dweik, director of the Cleveland Clinic, adding ""Breath analysis is the future of medical testing.""
He and his partners are testing a desktop system called BreathLink for use in rapid identification of diseases. The system is designed to work wherever there is an Internet connection. To use BreathLink, a person breathes into a long tube, and a breath sample is collected and analyzed within the system. Then it can detail chemical concentrations of the breath in graphics. Dr. Raed Dweik said, ""If you examine patients of asthma, you will find they have higher levels of nitric oxide  in their exhaled air. It reflects their abnormal symptoms in the lungs."" His tests have reached 85 percent accuracy so far in spotting people with some illness.
But some trained dogs, he pointed out, can sniff out cancer with 99 percent accuracy--although without the ability to identify particular compounds the way some detectors can.
""We are getting better and better,"" he said. ""But whether we will ever approach the accuracy of the dog--we don't know."" 
 Question:It can be inferred that  _ 
A. brushing teeth can improve one's bad breath 
B. there are leftovers like snacks and medicines in one's breath 
C. one can know exactly about his physical state through the breath 
D. breath analysis can be helpful in medical diagnosis 
 Answer: D
Context: A breathtaking trick potentially left over from our ancestors might be found in us -- the ability to sense oxygen through our skin.
Amphibians, animals such as frogs that can live both on land and in water, have long been known to be capable of breathing through their skin. In fact, the first known lungless frog that breathes only through its skin was discovered recently in the rivers of Borneo.
Now the same oxygen sensors found in frog skins and in the lungs of mammals   have unexpectedly been discovered in the skin of mice.
""No one had ever looked,"" explained Randall Johnson, a biologist researcher.
Mice and frogs are quite distant relatives, so the fact they have these molecules   in common in their skin suggests they might well be found in the skin of other mammals, such as humans.
""We have no reason to think that they are not in the skin of people too,"" Johnson said.
These molecules not only detect oxygen, but help increase levels of vital red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body. Normal mice breathing in air that is 10 percent oxygen--a dangerously low level similar to conditions at the top of Mount Everest, and about half that of air at sea level. However, mice that had the oxygen sensor HIF-1a genetically removed from their skin failed to produce this hormone   even after hours of such low oxygen.
These findings, if they hold true in humans, suggest one could raise the level of oxygen circulating inside the body. This could help treat lung diseases and disorders such as anemia   without injecting drugs, which make up a multibillion-dollar market, Johnson said.
Athletes also often try to get more oxygen delivered to their muscles in order to improve their performance. They often do this by training at high altitudes or in low-oxygen tents. The new study suggests they might want to expose their skin as well as breathing in low-oxygen air to improve their performance. ""It's hard to say what exactly might be done, however--there's a lot we don't know yet,"" Johnson explained.
The scientists detailed their findings in the April 18 issue of the journal Cell. 
 Question:One of the functions of the molecules mentioned above is   _  . 
A. increasing level of oxygen 
B. improving athletes' performance 
C. detecting oxygen 
D. carrying oxygen around the body

Context: Here is a story told about an American general who was a very important figure in the American army during the First World War. Everybody in the United States knew him and many people wished to have a picture or something of his in their homes.
Soon after the war the general returned to Washington. One day he went to a dentist and had six teeth pulled out. A week later the general heard that his teeth were being sold in curiosity shops as $ 5 each. On each of the teeth there was a label with the name of the general and words: ""Buy these teeth and show them to your friends at home."" The general got angry. He rushed to his office and ordered six officers to go around the city and buy all his teeth.
The officers went out and visited every curiosity shop in the capital. They were away from the office all day. In the evening they returned and put on the table in front of the general the teeth they had bought. They had collected 175 teeth. 
 Question:The general returned to Washington   _  . 
A. during the war 
B. after civil war 
C. after 1945

Context: When John Weston awoke that morning, he remembered that his mother was going into hospital. He hadn't worked out quite what was wrong with her. He knew, though that she hadn't been well for some time now, and it had become almost familiar to him to see her eyes narrowed in a sudden attack of pain, and her hand pressing against her heart. Their own doctor, who she had finally gone to for advice, had sent her to an expert who knew all about these things. He had told her that just as soon as there was a bed for her, she would have to come into his hospital where he could look after her himself.
During the weeks since then the pains had come even more frequently, and the narrowed eyes became an almost permanent part of her expression. Always rather sharp, she began losing her temper over little things so that John's father kept his thoughts to himself more and more. John, as ready as possible to make allowances, tried to think what it would be like to have toothache all the time and how bad-tempered that would make you.
So his mother would go into hospital for a few days. He was going to stay with his Aunt Daisy till she came back, and his father would stay on at home by himself. John's cousin, Mona, was to come in and make the bed and wash the pots and dust round now and again. That was the arrangement, and John didn't care much for it. Apart from missing his mother(and he was glad she was going away because they would make her better), he wasn't very fond of his Aunt Daisy because she was even more bad-tempered than his mother. 
 Question:how did John react to his mother's bad temper? 
A. he tried to imagine himself in her place. 
B. He tried not to notice it. 
C. He pretended that he had toothache. 
D. He behaved himself as well as possible.

Context: Height is just one of the thousands of features your genes decide. In fact, because you have two parents, your genes provide you a height that usually lands somewhere between the height of each parent. If both your parents are tall, then most probably you will be tall, too, but if you have questions about how tall you're going to be, ask your doctor if he or she can help you find it out.
But genes don't decide everything. For example, eating an unhealthy diet can keep you from growing to your ideal height. Getting plenty of sleep and enough exercise will help you grow to the expected height.
No doubt you're wondering how fast you should grow. It depends. There's no perfect or right answer. Generally speaking, kids grow about 2 inches (6 centimeters) a year between age 3 and the time when they start puberty (when your body starts changing and becoming more grown up).
Your doctor will know how your growth has been going over the years. Two centimeters here and 2 inches there are not nearly as important as the height you're at now, how you've been growing up to this point, and what other changes your body may be going through.
Don't be scared if you seem to have grown a lot in a very short time. Everyone has a growth spurt  during puberty. The age for starting puberty is about 10 for girls and about 11 for boys. But it can be earlier or later ---between 7 and 13 for girls and 9 and 15 for boys.
You'll usually begin to notice that you're growing faster about a year or so after your body starts to show the first changes of puberty. 
 Question:This passage is mainly about   _  . 
A. how the genes work in your body 
B. when is the time you grow fast 
C. why you look like your parents 
D. how you grow to a certain height 
 Answer: D
Context: Nearly half of elementary and high schools in the US use the Presidential Fitness Test. It checks kids' fitness levels. Students are tested at least twice a year. In 1956, US President Eisenhower created the test, and it has been a tradition in schools since 1966.
There are five activities in the test: sit-ups , push-ups , sit and reach, endurance run or walk and shuttle run . Students who get scores at or above 85 percent on all the activities can get a Presidential Physical Fitness Award.
The test encourages students to live a healthy and active life. Students taking the test are really testing their limits, according to the US National Association for Sport and Physical Education.
China has a similar test: the physical education(PE) test. Beginning at the age of 7, students in China are tested twice a year to check if they are healthy and strong. They also finish activities like the endurance run, sit-ups and the shuttle run.
However, unlike students in the US who get awards, Chinese students get points in PE tests. The highest score is 100. For junior school students, the PE test is more important because it is worth 30 to 40 points in the entrance exam for senior high school. In order to get a good score, most students begin to prepare for the test in their junior one year. 
 Question:Who can get a Presidential Physical Fitness Award? 
A. Students who finish all the activities. 
B. Students who finish first on the test. 
C. Students who make the greatest progress in the test. 
D. Students who get scores of 85 percent or above on all the activities.

Context: A new study shows that fat people in the United States suffer direct economic and social effects because of their size. The findings are from an 8-year study of about 100,000 people. The people who were studied were between the age of 18 and 24 when the research began.
The researchers who carried out the study say they consider the people fat if they are in the top of 5% of the measurement in which weight is linked to height. For example, fat women in the study were about 160 centimeters tall and weighed about 90 kilograms. Fat men in the study were about 175 centimeters tall and weighed 100 kilograms. The researchers say that more than 1,000,000 Americans are that big. The researchers found that fat young women were from wealthy families. The fat women also were 20% less likely to get married and they earned an average of about $6,700 a year less than other women. The study showed less
effects on fat men. They earned an average of about $3,000 a year less than other men. Fat men also were 11% less likely to get married. 
 Question:The researchers consider the people fat if    _   . 
A. they eat lots of food and do less exercise 
B. they are fatter than others 
C. they are in the top of 5% of the measurement of weight 
D. they are in the top of the measurement in which weight is linked to height.

Context: Malaria, the world's most widespread parasitic  disease, kills as many as three million people every year--almost all of whom are under five, very poor, and African. In most years, more than five hundred million cases of illness result from the disease, although exact numbers are difficult to assess because many people don't (or can't) seek care. It is not unusual for a family earning less than two hundred dollars a year to spend a quarter of its income on malaria treatment, and what they often get no longer works. In countries like Tanzania, Mozambique, and the Gambia, no family, village, hospital, or workplace can remain unaffected for long.
Malaria starts suddenly, with violent chills, which are soon followed by an intense fever and, often, headaches. As the parasites multiply, they take over the entire body. Malaria parasites live by eating the red blood cells they infect. They can also attach themselves to blood vessels in the brain. If it doesn't kill you, malaria can happen again and again for years. The disease passed on to humans by female mosquitoes infected with one of four species of parasite. Together, the mosquito and the parasite are the most deadly couple in the history of the earth--and one of the most successful. Malaria has five thousand genes, and its ability to change rapidly to defend itself and resist new drugs has made it nearly impossible to control. Studies show that mosquitoes are passing on the virus more frequently, and there are more outbreaks in cities with large populations. Some of the disease's spread is due to global warming.
For decades, the first-choice treatment for malaria parasites in Africa has been chloroquine, a chemical which is very cheap and easy to make. Unfortunately, in most parts of the world, malaria parasites have become resistant to it. Successful alternatives that help prevent resistance are already available, but they have been in short supply and are very expensive. If these drugs should fail, nobody knows what would come next. 
 Question:It can be inferred from the passage that  _  . 
A. no drugs have been found to treat the disease 
B. the alternative treatment is not easily available to most people 
C. malaria has developed its ability to resist parasites 
D. nobody knows what will be the drug to treat the disease

Context: Doctors fighting malaria---one of the deadliest diseases on the planet--- may soon have a new affordable weapon in their smart phones. Researchers have found a way to use the phone's camera to detect the microorganism in the patient's blood that causes the disease.
According to the World Health Organization, almost 600,000 people died of malaria in 2013, making this mosquito-borne disease one of the deadliest in the world.
The saddest aspect of this calamity  is that it affects mostly young children.
Early detection of the infection is important for successful treatment. But since the first symptoms resemble ordinary flu, a microbiologist must look at a drop of a patient's blood under a microscope for a proper diagnosis.
Scientists in Britain have now developed a smart phone attachment called Xrapid, that turns the phone into a 200-power microscope, while the attached app---based on facial recognition software - quickly detects the parasitic protozoa in the blood smear .
Jean Viry-Babel is the CEO of IanXen, the company that developed the app. He says it is cheap and works on the spot. ""So we take a high-definition picture of a sample of blood. We separate the red blood cells from the rest---the white blood cells, the platelets ---and we start looking at each of the red blood cells individually,"" said Viry-Babel.
Viry-Babel says the app is affordable, easy to use and provides reliability of up to 98 percent. The only additional equipment required is an ordinary glass lab slide - called a ""slate.""
""There's only one button, which is called ""Diagnose"". So you put it on the slate and you put it on the dried blood, and you press diagnose and it tells you yes or no,"" he said.
Researchers say the field-testing of the device will begin in January and February in Tanzania, Benin and Indonesia --- while commercial use is scheduled to start by the end of March.
They also plan to expand the versatility of the new device---teaching it to recognize other diseases, such as tuberculosis and Lyme Disease. 
 Question:What can we learn from Viry-Babel? 
A. The app is cheap but must work in the lab. 
B. The white cells and the platelets must be studied carefully. 
C. The accuracy of the app is nearly a hundred percent. 
D. The ""Diagnose"" button should function well with others.

Context: A mom in Australia was told by a doctor that her newborn son was ""dead"",but she helped bring him back to life  by holding the baby against her body.

Context: Dear Maya Shao-ming,
To me, June 6, 1990 is a special day. My long-awaited dream came true the minute your father cried, ""A girl!"" You are more than just a second child, more than just a girl to match our boy. You, little daughter, are the link to our female line, the legacy of another woman's pain and sacrifice 31 years ago.
Let me tell you about your Chinese grandmother. Somewhere in Hong Kong, in the late fifties, a young waitress found herself pregnant   by a cook, probably a co-worker at her restaurant. She carried the baby to term, suffered to give it birth, and kept the little girl for the first three months of her life. I like to think that my mother--your grandmother--loved me and fought to raise me on her own, but that the daily struggle was too hard. Worn down by the demands of the new baby and perhaps the constant threat of starvation, she made the painful decision to give away her girl so that both of us might have a chance for a better life.
More likely, I was dropped at the orphanage (M JLR) steps or somewhere else. I will probably never know the truth. Having a baby in her unmarried state would have brought shame on the family in China, so she probably kept my existence a secret. Once I was out of her life, it was as if I had never been born. And so you and your brother and I are the missing leaves on a family tree.
Do they ever wonder if we exist?
Before I was two, I was adopted by an Anglo couple. Fed three square meals a day, I grew like a wild weed and grasped all the opportunities they had to offer--books, music, education, church life and community activities. In a family of blue-eyed blonds, though, _ . Whether from jealousy or fear of someone who looked so different, my older brothers sometimes teased me about my unpleasing skin, or made fun of my clumsy walk. Moody and impatient, burdened by fears that none of us realized resulted from my early years of need, I was not an easy child to love. My mother and I conflicted countless times over the years, but gradually came to see one another as real human beings with faults and talents, and as women of strength in our own right. Lacking a mirror image in the mother who raised me, I had to seek my identity as a woman on my own. The Asian American community has helped me regain my double identity.
But part of me will always be missing: my beginnings, my personal history, all the delicate details that give a person her origin. Nevertheless, someone gave me a lucky name ""Siu Wai."" ""Siu"" means ""little,"" and ""Wai means ""clever."" Therefore, my baby name was ""Clever little one."" Who chose those words? Who cared enough to note my arrival in the world?
I lost my Chinese name for 18 years. It was Americanized for convenience to ""Sue."" But like an ill-fitting coat, it made me uncomfortable. I hated the name. But even more, I hated being Chinese. It took many years to become proud of my Asian origin and work up the courage to take back my birth-name. That, plus a little knowledge of classroom Cantonese, is all the Chinese culture I have to offer you. Not white, certainly, but not really Asian, I try to pave  the way between the two worlds and bridge the gap for you. Your name, ""Shao-ming,"" is very much like mine--""Shao"" means ""little."" And ""ming"" is ""bright,"" as in a shining sun or moon. Whose lives will you brighten, little Maya? Your past is more complete than mine, and each day I cradle you in your babyhood, generously giving you the loving care I lacked for my first two years. When I pat you, I comfort the lost baby inside me who still cries for her mother.
Sweet Maya, it doesn't matter what you ""become"" later on. You have already fulfilled my wildest dreams.
I love you,
Mommy 
 Question:What can be inferred from Mommy's Anglo family life?

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. "" 
 Question:Jennie gave her bone marrow to   _  . 
A. a close friend 
B. a stranger 
C. a classmate 
D. a

Context: A new study shows that fat people in the United States suffer direct economic and social effects because of their size. The findings are from an 8-year study of about 100,000 people. The people who were studied were between the age of 18 and 24 when the research began.
The researchers who carried out the study say they consider the people fat if they are in the top of 5% of the measurement in which weight is linked to height. For example, fat women in the study were about 160 centimeters tall and weighed about 90 kilograms. Fat men in the study were about 175 centimeters tall and weighed 100 kilograms. The researchers say that more than 1,000,000 Americans are that big. The researchers found that fat young women were from wealthy families. The fat women also were 20% less likely to get married and they earned an average of about $6,700 a year less than other women. The study showed less
effects on fat men. They earned an average of about $3,000 a year less than other men. Fat men also were 11% less likely to get married. 
 Question:The researchers consider the people fat if    _   . 
A. they eat lots of food and do less exercise

Context: It is well-known that when an individual joins a group, he tends to accept the group's standards of behavior and thinking. Many illustrations could be given of this from everyday life, but what is of particular interest to psychologists is the extent to which people's judgments and opinions can be changed as a result of group pressure, Asch and others noticed that people in a group will agree to statements that are contrary to the evidence of their senses. It would be a mistake to think that only particularly docile people are chosen to take part in experiments of this type. Usually highly intelligent and independent people are used. In a typical experiment, this is what may happen.
   The experimenter asks for volunteers to join a group which is investigating visual perception .The victims are not, therefore, aware of the real purpose of the experiment. Each volunteer is taken to a room where he finds a group of about seven people who are cooperating with the experimenter. The group is shown a standard card which contains a single line. They are then asked to look at a second card. This has three lines on it. One is obviously longer than the line on the first card; one is shorter and one the same length. They have to say which line on the second card is the same length as the line on the standard card. The other members of the group answer first but what the volunteer does not know is that they have been told to pick one of the wrong lines. When his turn comes, he is faced with the unanimous opinion of the rest of the group-all the others have chosen line A but he quite clearly sees line B as correct. What will be do? According to Asch, more than half of the vietims chosen will change their opinion. What is equally surprising is that, when interviewed about their answers, most explained that they knew the group choice was incorrect but that they gave in to the pressure of the group because they thought they must be suffering from an optical illusion , or because they were afraid of being different.

Context: Ever feel like you've been hit on the head after a bad night's sleep? According to scientists, the thought isn't as unbelievable as it seems.
A study found going without sleep for just one night causes changes in the brain similar to those that occur after a blow to the head. The researchers said the healthy young men examined in the study showed a sudden increase in the same chemicals which indicate brain damage. Professor Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, Sweden, explained that the chemicals NSE and S-100B are biomarkers for brain damage, such as concussion . He said, ""What we found was their levels in the blood rose in the group that went without sleep for a night. This was not to the extent that would happen after a head injury, for instance, but it was still significant. During sleep, the brain cleans poisonous substances off itself.""
Benedict also said previous studies which linked a lack of sleep with increased risk of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis could applaud his study. The rise of the chemicals in the blood after sleep loss may suggest not getting enough sleep contributes to a loss of brain tissue, he explained. Benedict, whose study is published in the journalSleep, added, ""In conclusion, the findings of our experiment indicate a good night's sleep may be critical to maintaining brain health.""
A third of the UK population suffer from sleep-related problems, while the average person now sleeps for only seven hours a night, compared with almost nine a few decades ago. Many scientists believe irregular sleeping patterns lead to illnesses ranging from aches and pains to heart disease, while less than eight hours' sleep a night can lower the IQ the next day. 
 Question:What do we know about previous studies? 
A. They found reasons for brain disorders. 
B. Their findings were published inSleep. 
C. They were supported by Benedict's study. 
D. They focused on brain health.

Context: All things change except barbers, the ways of barbers, and the surroundings of barbers. These never change. What one experiences in a barber's shop the first time he enters one is what he always experiences in barbers' shops afterward till the end of his days.
I got shaved this morning as usual. A man approached the door from Jones Street as I approached it from Main--a thing that always happens. I hurried up, but it was of no use; he entered the door one little step ahead of me, and I followed in and saw him take the only empty chair, the one headed by the best barber. It always happens so. I sat down, hoping that I might sit in the chair belonging to the better of the remaining two barbers, for he was a bit ahead. I watched the probabilities with strong interest. When I saw that No. 2 was gaining on No. 1, my interest grew to solicitude  . When No. 1 was gradually losing the race, my solicitude rose to anxiety. When No. 1 caught up again, and both were about to finish and say ""Next!"" first, my very breath stood still with the _ . But when I saw that he had lost the race by a single instant, I rose angrily and quitted the shop, to keep from falling into the hands of No. 2; for I have none of that firmness that enables a man to look calmly into the eyes of a waiting barber and tell him he will wait for his fellow-barber's chair.
I stayed out fifteen minutes, and then went back, hoping for better luck. Unfortunately, all the chairs were occupied now, and four men sat waiting, silent, and looking bored, as men always do who are waiting their turn in a barber's shop. I sat down and waited.
At last my turn came. A voice said ""Next!"" and I give in to No. 2, of course. It always happens so. I smiled and said that I was in a hurry, and it affected him as strongly as if he had never heard it.
He explored my hair with his claws and suggested that it needed trimming . I said I did not want it trimmed. He explored again and said it was pretty long for the present style. I said I had had it cut only a week before. He stopped for a moment, and then asked ""who cut it?"" I stared at him from the mirror and replied ""You did!"". Then a dog-fight attracted his attention, and he ran to the window and stayed and watched it...

Context: With thousands of years of history and mythology in its area, prefix = st1 /Athens--named for the olive-tree-loving Athena---is more than a concrete jungle. It's a lovely city decorated by outdoor cafes, pedestrian streets, parks, gardens and plenty of characters. _ 
    The city is connected three sides by Mt Parnitha, Mt Pendeli and Mt Hymettos. WithinAthensthere are no less than eight hills, of which the Acropolis and Lykavitos are the most famous. The hills provide a peaceful rest from the noise of the city.
    Just about everything of interest to the traveler is within a small area surrounding Plateia Syntagmatos (Syntagma Square). This area is connected with the districts of Plaka to the south, Monastiraki to the west, Kolonaki to the east and Omaonia to the north.
    Plateia Syntagmatos is dominated by the oldRoalPalaceand is the beating heart of the business district, with luxury hotels, banks and airline offices. Plaka, nestled below the Acropolis, is the old Turkish quarter and virtually all that existed when Athens was declared the capital of independentGreece. Though Plaka is packed with tourists in high season, it's also one of the prettiest and most atmospheric areas of the city. Monastiraki is the market district and a fascinating part of town to wander. Psiri, nearby, is full of stylish cafes and bars and makes a great place to stop for a rest of lunch. Kolonaki, a classy living area, is full of trendy boutiques, art galleries and cafes.

Context: All plant cells are capable of taking up water. Even dead ones do to a certain degree. Absorption of water by dead cell walls makes wood become larger.
In common land plants, the living cells of roots take upmost of the water. Land plants without roots do exist, however. Those greenish-yellow lichens you see on rocks in the high mountains have no roots. Half a billion years ago, when water plants started to enter the land, the first land plants did not have roots.
Even among the flowering plants, one finds rootless forms. These flowering plants are ""the higher plants"" because they evolved recently and are thus considered higher on the evolutionary scale .
In the Peruvian desert, there grows one of these rootless higher plants, a bromeliad. It is a relative of the pineapple. Even if this plant had roots, they would be of no use, because where the plant grows, it never rains. The plant gets its water only from the dew it collects at night, when its leaves cool off. Such rootless plants, of course, can be moved with ease, but they will only grow when they are placed out in the open. If they are placed too near a house, the radiation from the heat of the house prevents the leaves from cooling and so prevents dew from forming, and the plant dies.
In the southern United States and in Puerto Rico, one sees
growing high above the streets on the insulation of electric wires. These plants get their water from rain, and the only soil they ever come in contact with is the dust that may blow on their leaves. 
 Question:The ""bromeliad"" is a plant that    _    . 
A. has no roots 
B. is a pineapple 
C. can grow anywhere 
D. takes up water through its leaves

Context: For centuries, medical pioneers have refined a variety of methods and medicines to treat sickness, injury, and disability, enabling people to live longer and healthier lives.
""A salamander (a small lizard-like animal) can grow back its leg. Why can't a human do the same?"" asked Peruvian-born surgeon Dr. Anthony Atala in a recent interview. The question, a reference to work aiming to grow new limbs for wounded soldiers, captures the inventive spirit of regenerative medicine. This innovative field seeks to provide patients with replacement body parts.
These parts are not made of steel; they are the real things --- living cells, tissue, and even organs.
Regenerative medicine is still mostly experimental, with clinical applications limited to procedures such as growing sheets of skin on burns and wounds. One of its most significant advances took place in 1999,when a research group at North Carolina's Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine conducted a successful organ replacement with a laboratory-grown bladder. Since then, the team, led by Dr. Atala, has continued to generate a variety of other tissues and organs  from kidneys to ears.
The field of regenerative medicine builds on work conducted in the early twentieth century with the first successful transplants of donated human soft tissue and bone. However, donor organs are not always the best option. First of all, they are in short supply, and many people die while waiting for an available organ; in the United States alone, more than 100,000 people are waiting for organ transplants. Secondly, a patient's body may ultimately reject the transplanted donor organ. An advantage of regenerative medicine is that the tissues are grown from a patient's own cells and will not be rejected by the body's immune system.
Today, several labs are working to create bioartificial body parts. Scientists at Columbia and Yale Universities have grown a jawbone and a lung. At the University of Minnesota, Doris Taylor has created a beating bioartificial rat heart. Dr. Atala's medical team has reported long-term success with bioengineered bladders implanted into young patients with spina bifida (a birth defect that involves the incomplete development of the spinal cord). And at the University of Michigan, H. David Humes has created an artificial kidney.
So far, the kidney procedure has only been used successfully with sheep, but there is hope that one day similar kidney will be implantable in a human patient. The continuing research of scientists such as these may eventually make donor organs unnecessary and, as a result, significantly increase individuals' chances of survival. 
 Question:Why is generative medicine considered innovative? 
A. It will provide patients with replacement soft tissues. 
B. It will strengthen the human body's immune system. 
C. It will shorten the time patients waiting for a donated organ. 
D. It will make patients live longer with bioartificial organs.

Context: Germs are everywhere. You can't see them, but they are on your desk, on your computer, and even in the air!
Like people, germs move around the world. They fly with us on planes. When food, clothes, and other things travel around the world, germs travel, too. Some germs are safe, but some are dangerous. Germs cause illnesses like colds and the flu. 
Warmer Weather Brings Germs
The world's weather is changing. Cooler countries are getting warmer, so insects from hot countries can move  _ . Some of these insects, like mosquitoes, carry dangerous germs. These germs cause headaches, fever, and can even kill people.
Under Your Skin
Your skin protects you from germs. It stops some germs, but not all. They can enter your body when you eat, or when you have a cut. Germs are on your hands, too. They enter your body when you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. 
Fighting Germs 
Your immune system  protects you, too. When germs get inside your body, your immune system finds and kills them. Special cells move around your body and fight germs. They help you stay healthy. Other cells make antibodies. Antibodies help your body find and stop germs. 
What can you do to fight germs? You should wash your hands with soap and water. Soap kills many germs, and water washes them away. 
 Question:Which of the following is right according to the text? 
A. All germs are dangerous. 
B. There are more germs in cold places. 
C. Soap can kill all germs. 
D. Germs can get into your body.

Context: TOKYO -- The number of domestic infections cases of influenza A/H1N1 in Japan hits 42 on Sunday after a total of 34 people in Osaka and Hyogo counties were confirmed to have been infected, local media reported.
The total number of the infection in the country now stands at 46, including the first four cases contracted abroad.
The country is now facing the risk of grass-root outbreak which could lead the WHO to raise its new flu pandemic alert to the highest level of 6 from the current 5, experts has warned.
The 34 newly confirmed domestic cases, 11 in Osaka and 23 in Hyogo, included high school students, college students and teachers, the health ministry and local governments said Sunday.
Japan on Saturday confirmed the first eight cases of domestic infection on students of a Kobe high school. The later confirmed cases in Osaka are said to have contacted the Kobe students in a volleyball match. Osaka and Hyogo are neighboring in the Kansai region.
All of the 42 people had no record of overseas travel.
Meanwhile, a total of 143 students at the Kansai Okura Senior High School where many infections in Osaka were found, have shown symptoms of influenza since around Monday, according to local media reports.
The privately run school said it will be closed from Monday through Saturday.
More than 1,000 educational facilities -- kindergartens, and elementary, junior and senior high schools -- in Osaka and Hyogo counties have decided to suspend classes for certain periods following the confirmation of new flu infections in the counties, Kyodo News reported.
The two counties have requested private schools to follow suit.
Osaka Governor Toru Hashimoto held a meeting of a new flu task force on Sunday and decided to ask facilities such as movie theaters to suspend operations to prevent the spread of the flu.
TV clips showed people in Kansai region started to wear masks in public spaces and rushed to drug stores for buying medicines.
The Japanese government on Saturday shifted the stage of its new-flu action program from ""a period of overseas outbreak"" to ""a period of domestic outbreak"" and called for companies and schools in the areas concerned to allow individuals to avoid commuting  during rush hours.
The Kyodo News quoted Masato Tashiro, a member of the World Health Organization's emergency committee, as saying that several hundred people in Japan already may have been infected with the new flu. 
 Question:Which of the following is one of the measures already taken by the Japanese government? 
A. Raising the new flu pandemic alert to the highest level. 
B. Holding a meeting to ask some facilities in the country to stop their operations. 
C. Calling for individuals in the whole country to avoid commuting during rush hours. 
D. Changing its stage of its new-flu action program to a more serious level.

Context: It seems like every year brings a new outbreak of sickness.Recent research tells us how diseases spread, from person to person.And it also gives us an idea how we can spread something better than diseases.
         An author called Malcom Gladwell recently published a book explaining how the process works.We usually think of an epidemic   as a force of nature that rolls over anyone in its way.In fact, it starts with a single person or very few people.These people travel around and infect   small groups in different places.When enough of these groups are infected, then the disease suddenly seems to be everywhere.Gladwell also found that the process of infection was not just limited to disease? It also affects the world of ideas.
         The process can be seen in books and fashion.So called  _ are not pushed towards the public.They spread through hundreds of small reading groups until the day when everybody you know seems to have a copy.A group of young people may decide to wear an item of clothing simply because no one else is wearing it.Designers who monitor street fashion then pick up the idea and spread it.Finally everyone is wearing it.
         New York is often described as an unfriendly place.People are too busy looking after business to look after each other.In the early 1990s, one unknown person decided to perform at least one kind act a day.This caught on with his or her friends.The newspapers noticed the trend  .New York became full of people smiling and carrying each other's bags.
         The success of trends like this fits in with other social phenomena  .One is the 80/20 rule.This was invented by economists who noticed that in any situation 20 percent of the people did 80 percent of the work.Another is the ""bystander problem"".Psychologists noticed that in accidents where a large number of people were around, no one stepped forward to help.Each person supposed that someone else would do something.When there were less people present, more of them decided to offer help.
What all this proves is the power of individuals   and small groups.The ""epidemic model"" could be a great way of making a business grow or spreading an idea.A small start can make a big difference.

The respiratory  virus known as SARS has appeared to spread in the United States only to family members of health workers with close contact to a sick person.
On Thursday, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there might be a case of severe acute respiratory syndrome  spreading through the workplace.
Dr. Julie Gerberding said a suspected SARS virus patient who became ill after traveling to Asia might have infected a co-worker in Florida, which made her ""very worried"".
So far, a dozen people--nine family members and three health workers--were infected after coming into close contact with the person with SARS. The rest of the 166 suspected American cases have something to do with people who were infected while traveling in Asia.
In the Gainesville, Fla. area, a 47-year-old woman was believed to have been infected at work by a 60-year-old woman who was the nation's first suspected SARS case, said Tom Belcuore, director of the Alachua County health department.
Since the World Health Organization announced a worldwide warning last month about SARS, the United States has started infection control in hospitals and among families of suspected cases.
Florida officials said a school in Okaloosa County went through a cleaning after a 6-year-old boy suspected of having SARS appeared at school with slight symptoms. ""Health officials are watching the boys' contacts at school to make sure no one else is infected,"" said Rob Hayes, health department spokesman, ""The boy may have been infected from a family member,"" Hayes said, ""We immediately became aware of it and had the child sent home. He's staying at home with his family until 10 days after symptoms disappear.""
The researchers guessed that the virus might have come from animals. However, the scientists have not ruled out the possibility that some other microbe might also help make SARS more serious or easier to catch. 
 Question:How many cases of suspected SARS are there in the U.S.A. according to the text? 
A. 166. 
B. 178. 
C. 12. 
D. 181.

Context: The deadliest Ebola  outbreak in recorded history is happening right now. The outbreak is unprecedented  both in the number of people who have gotten sick and in the geographic scope. And so far it's been a long battle that doesn't appear to be slowing down.
Ebola is both rare and very deadly. Since the first outbreak in 1976, Ebola viruses have infected thousands of people and killed roughly killed 60 percent of them. Symptoms can come on quickly and kill fast.
The current outbreak started in Guinea sometime in late 2013 or early 2014. It has since spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia, including some capital cities. And one infected patient traveled on a plane to Nigeria, where he spread the disease to several others and then died. Cases have also popped up in various other countries throughout the world, including in Dallas and New York City in the United States.
The Ebola virus has now hit many countries, including Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Senegal, and the United States. The virus, which starts off with flu-like symptoms and sometimes ends with bleeding, has infected about 6,500 people and killed more than 3,000 since this winter, according to the World Health Organization on September 30, 2014.
There are some social and political factors contributing to the current disaster. Because this is the first major Ebola outbreak in West Africa, many of the region's health workers didn't have experience or training in how to protect themselves or care for patients with this disease.
Journalist David Quammen put it well in a recent New York Times article, ""Ebola is more dangerous to humans than perhaps any known virus on Earth, except rabies  and HIV. And it does its damage much faster than either.""
Hopefully, researchers are working to find drugs, including a recent $50 million push at the National Institutes of Health. And scientists are working on vaccines , including looking into ones that might be able to help wild chimpanzees, which are also susceptible to the disease. The first human Ebola vaccine trial is scheduled to start in the spring of 2015.

Context: Researchers have announced the result of two studies on the health effects of the drug aspirin.One study shows aspirin can sharply reduce the chance that a healthy, older man will suffer from a heart attack.
The study offered two new results from earlier findings, It said taking one aspirin pili every other day helped only healthy men over the age of fifty.It also said aspirin gave the greatest protection against heart attacks to men with low blood cholesterol levels.
Earlier in the United States began a major aspirin study in the early 1980s.It included 22,000 healthy men doctors.Ail were between the ages of forty and eighty-four.More than 11,000 of the doctors took a harmless pill that contained no drug.The men did not know which kind of pill they were taking.
The doctors who took aspirin suffered 44% fewer heart attacks than those taking the harmless pill.139 men who took aspirin suffered from heart attacks.Ten of them died.239 men who did not take aspirin suffered from heart attacks.Twenty-six of them died.
The researchers said the doctors' study provides clear proof that taking aspirin can prevent a first heart attack in healthy, older men.They said, however, the result does not mean every man over the mage of fifty should take aspirin.They said aspirin couldn't help men who do not eat healthy foods, who smoke cigarettes and who are fat.The researchers said men who think they wou3d be helped by taking aspirin should talk with their doctors first. 
 Question:We may learn that the new use of aspirin is   _  . 
A. to treat heart disease 
B. to reduce the chance of a heart attack in old men 
C. to protect old men 
D. to reduce the blood cholesterol levels 
 Answer: B
Context: We discuss the issue of when to help a patient die. Doctors of our generation are not newcomers to this question. Going back to my internship days, I can remember many patients in pain, sometimes in coma , with late, hopeless cancer. For many of them, we wrote an order for heavy medication--morphine by the clock. This was not talked about openly and little was written about it. It was essential, not controversial.
The best way to bring the problem into focus is to describe two patients whom I cared for. The first, formerly a nurse, had an automobile accident. A few days later her lungs seemed to fill up; her heart developed dangerous rhythm disturbances. So there she was: in coma, on a breathing machine, her heartbeat maintained with an electrical device. One day after rounds, my secretary said the husband and son of the patient wanted to see me. They told me their wife and mother was obviously going to die; she was a nurse and had told her family that she never wanted this kind of terrible death, being maintained by machines. I told them that while I respected their view, there was nothing deadly about her situation. The kidney  failure she had was just the kind for which the artificial kidney was most effective. While possibly a bit reassured, they were disappointed. Here was the head surgeon seemingly determined to keep everybody alive, no matter what.
Within a few days the patient's pacemaker  could be removed and she awoke from her coma. About six months later, the door of my office opened and in walked a gloriously fit woman. After some cheery words of appreciation, the father and son asked to speak to me alone. As soon as the door closed, both men became quite tearful. All that came out was, ""We want you to know how wrong we were.""
The second patient was an 85-year-old lady whose hair caught fire while she was smoking. She arrived with a deep burn; I knew it would surely be deadly. As a remarkable coincidence there was a meeting for discussion going on at the time in medical ethics . The speaker asked me if I had any sort of ethical problem I could bring up for discussion. I described the case and asked the students their opinion. After the discussion, I made a remark that was, when looking back, a serious mistake. I said, ""I'll take the word back to the nurses about her and we will talk about it some more before we decide."" The instructor and the students were shocked: ""You mean this is a real patient?"" The teacher of ethics was not accustomed to being challenged by actuality. In any event, I went back and met with the nurses. A day or two later, when she was making no progress and was suffering terribly, we began to back off treatment. Soon she died quietly and not in pain. As a reasonable physician, you had better move ahead and do what you would want done for you. And don't discuss it with the world first. There is a lesson here for everybody. Assisting people to leave this life requires strong judgment and long experience to avoid its misuse.

Context: The size and shape  of your ears show your character more than any other parts of the face. Other parts of the face change shape as we get older, but ears do not change their shape. They only change in size.
Reading people's character from their ears is an old science. In very old times people thought that a person with big ears had a good and generous character. They thought that a person with pale, small ears was dangerous. They also thought that the shape of the ear showed if a person was musical. Today, too many people believe that the size and the shape of the ear help you know if a person is musical.
Ears are all different, and each characteristic has a meaning. Next time when you look at a person, see if his ears are large, medium-size or small. Look at the lobes (the lowest part of the ear). Do they stick to the face? Ears that are always red mean a person may easily get angry, or he / she just has high blood pressure  . Ears that are always cold and pale mean a person has a nervous character. And a big inside hole of the ear means a person is musical. 
 Question:We can guess Beethoven (a world-famous musician) may have. 
A. ears with a big inside hole 
B. round white ears 
C. ears with a hole in the lobes 
D. big red ears

Context: Some scientists say that animals in the ocean are increasingly threatened by noise pollution caused by human beings. The noise that affects sea creatures comes from a number of human activities. It is caused mainly by industrial underwater explosions, ocean drilling, and ship engines. Such noises are added to natural sounds. These sounds include the breaking of ice fields, underwater earthquakes, and sounds made by animals themselves.
Decibels  measured in water are different from those measured on land. A noise of 120 decibels on land causes pain to human ears. In water, a decible level of 195 would have the same effect.
Some scientists have suggested setting a noise limit of 120 decibles in oceans. They have observed that noises above that level can frighten and confuse whales.
A team of American and Canadian scientists discovered that loud noises could seriously injure some animals. The research team found that powerful underwater explosions were causing whales in the area to lose their hearing, which seriously affected the whales' ability to exchange information and find their way. Some of the whales even died. The explosions had caused their ears to bleed and become infected .
Many researches whose work depends on ocean sounds disagree with a limit of 120 decibels. They say such a limit would mean an end to important industrial and scientific research.
Scientists do not know how many and what kinds of noises are harmful to ocean animals. However, many scientists suspect that noise is a greater danger than they previously believed. They want to prevent noises from harming creatures in the ocean. 
 Question:As to  the effects of noises on whales, which of the following statements is TRUE according to the passage? 
A. They are deaf to noises. 
B. Noises at a certain level may hurt them. 
C. They are easily confused by noises. 
D. Noises will limit their ability to reproduce.

Context: Nowadays, the food we eat seems to have great effects on our health. Although science has made enormous steps in making food more fit to eat, it has, at the same time, made many foods unfit to eat. Some research has shown that perhaps eighty percent of all human illnesses are related to diet and forty percent of cancer is related to the diet as well, especially cancer of the colon. Different cultures are more likely to cause certain different illnesses because of the food that is characteristic in these cultures.
That food is related to illness is not a new discovery. In 1945, about 68 years ago, government researchers realized that nitrates, commonly used to preserve color in meats, and other food additives, caused cancer. Yet, these carcinogenic additives remain in our food, and it becomes more difficult all the time to know which things on the packaging labels of processed food are helpful or harmful. The additives which we eat are not all so direct. Farmers often give penicillin to beef and living animals, and because of this, penicillin has been found in the milk of treated cow. Sometimes similar drugs are given to animals not for medical purposes, but for financial reasons. The farmers are simply trying to fatten the animals in order to obtain a higher price on the market. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has tried repeatedly to control these procedures, the practices continue. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is NOT true? 
A. Drugs are always given to animals for medical reasons 
B. Some of the additives in our food are added to the food itself and some are given to the living animals 
C. Researchers have known about the potential dangers of food additives for over thirty-five years.

Context: For decades, public health officials have puzzled over a surprising fact about HIV: Only about 10-20 percent of infants who are breastfed by infected mothers catch the virus. Tests show, though, that HIV is indeed present in breast milk, so these children are exposed to the virus multiple times daily for the first several months of their lives.
Now, a group of scientists and doctors from Duke University has figured out why these babies don't get infected. Human breast milk naturally contains a protein called Tenascin C that neutralizes HIV and, in most cases, prevents it from being passed from mother to child. Eventually, they say, the protein could potentially be valuable as an HIV-fighting tool for both infants and adults that are either HIV-positive or at risk of contracting the infection.
The research, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was inspired by previous work by other researchers showing that, both in tissue cultures   and live mice, breast milk from HIV-negativemothers was naturally endowed with HIV-fighting properties. Scientists suggested that a few different proteins in the milk could potentially be responsible, but no one knew which one.
As part of the study, the researchers divided breast milk into smaller fractions   made up of specific proteins via a number of filters   -- separating the proteins by size, electrical charge and other characteristics--and tested which of these fractions, when added to a tissue culture, prevented the cells from being infected by HIV. Eventually, they found that one particular protein was present in all the HIV-resistant fractions but in none of the others: Tenascin C.
Tenascin C works by blocking a key protein on HIV's envelope that normally ties up to a receptor on a T cell's membrane called CCR5. In doing so, Tenascin C prevents HIV from mixing with the T cell and injecting its RNA inside.
Still, the researchers say that other natural elements in milk might play a role in fighting HIV as well. ""It's clearly not the whole story, because we do have samples that have low amounts of this protein but still have HIV-neutralizing activity,"" the study's lead author Permar says. ""So it may be acting in concert with other antiviral and antimicrobial factors in the milk.""
Whatever those other factors are, though, the finding vindicates (......) recent changes to UN guidelines that recommend even HIV-positive mothers in resource-poor countries should breastfeed, if they're taking anti-retroviral drugs to combat their own infection.
The next steps, Permar says, are determining which area of Tenascin C is active and whether it can effectively prevent transmission in a live animal. If it works, it could potentially be incorporated   into an HIV drug with broader applications. It's even possible that it could someday be adapted to reduce the risk of HIV transmission in adults as well as infants. 
 Question:Which of the following about Tenascin C is true? 
A. It has become an effective tool in fighting HIV. 
B. It was first found by Permar and her research group. 
C. It can prevent transmission in a live animal effectively. 
D. It can sometimes prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

Context: The health-care economy is filled with unusual and even unique economic relationships. One of the least understood involves the peculiar roles of producer or ""provider"" and purchaser or ""consumer"" in the typical doctor-patient relationship. In most sectors of the economy, it is the seller who attempts to attract a potential buyer with various appealing factors of price, quality, and use, and it is the buyer who makes the decision. Such condition, however, is not common in most of the health-care industry.
In the health-care industry, the doctor-patient relationship is the mirror image of the ordinary relationship between producer and consumer. Once an individual has chosen to see a physician -- and even then there may be no real choice -- it is the physician who usually makes all significant purchasing decisions: whether the patient should return ""next Wednesday"", whether X-rays are needed, whether drugs should be prescribed, etc. It is rare that a patient will challenge such professional decisions or raise in advance questions about price, especially when the disease is regarded as serious.
This is particularly significant in relation to hospital care. The physician must certify the need for hospitalization, determine what procedures will be performed, and announce when the patient may be discharged. The patient may be consulted about some of the decisions, but in general it is the doctor's judgments that are final. Little wonder then that in the eye of the hospital it is the physician who is the real ""consumer"". As a consequence, the medical staff represents the ""power center"" in hospital policy and decision-making, not the administration.
Although usually there are in this situation four identifiable participants-- the physician, the hospital, the patient, and the payer (generally an insurance carrier or government)-- the physician makes the essential decisions for all of them. The hospital becomes an extension of the physician; the payer generally meets most of the bills generated by the physician/hospital, and for the most part the patient plays a passive role. We estimate that about 75-80 percent of health-care choices are determined by physicians, not patients. For this reason, the economy directed at patients or the general is relatively ineffective. 
 Question:The author's primary purpose in writing this passage is to   _  . 
A. urge hospitals to reclaim their decision-making authority 
B. inform potential patients of their health-care rights 
C. criticize doctors for exercising too much control over patients

Context: Perhaps it is hard to imagine that a bad tooth could be deadly. But doctors in the Washington area say a twelveyearold boy died last month of a tooth infection that spread to his brain. They say it might have been prevented if the boy had received the dental care he needed.
Experts at the National Institutes of Health say good dental care should start at birth. They say breast milk is the best food for the healthy development of teeth. Breast milk can help slow bacterial growth and acid production in the mouth.
When baby's teeth begin to appear,you can clean them with a wet toothbrush. Dentists say it is important to find soft toothbrushes made especially for babies,and use them very gently.
The use of fluoride   to protect teeth is common in many parts of the world. This natural element is often added to drinking water supplies. The fluoride mixes with enamel ,the hard surface on teeth,to help prevent holes,or cavities from forming.
But the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry points out that young children often swallow toothpaste when they brush their teeth. The group notes that swallowing fluoridated toothpaste can cause problems. So young children should be carefully supervised when they brush their teeth. And only a small amount of fluoridated toothpaste,the size of a green pea,should be used.
Parents often wonder what effects sucking a thumb or sucking on a pacifier might have on their baby's teeth. Dental experts generally agree that this is fine early in life.
The American Academy of Family Physicians says most kids stop sucking their thumbs by the age of four. If it continues,the group advises parents to talk to their child's dentist or doctor. It could influence the correct development of permanent teeth. 
 Question:The boy with a bad tooth died because  _  . 
A. his tooth disease was very deadly 
B. the doctor refused to treat him properly 
C. he didn't receive timely treatment 
D. something was wrong with his brain

Context: People should go outside and absorb some sunshine to help increase their vitamin D levels, some experts say. Arthritis Research UK. which is a British medical research organization dedicated to curing arthritis  , says vitamin D deficiency can cause bone loss, muscle function problems and, in some cases, rickets   in children.
The government recommends vitamin D supplements   for pregnant women and children aged under five. But on sunny days, a few minutes outdoors should achieve the same results, Arthritis Research UK says.
Figures show that up to a quarter of the population has low levels of vitamin D in their blood and the majority of pregnant women do not take vitamin D supplements. People aged over 65, pregnant and breast-feeding women and children aged six months to five years old are thought to be most at risk.
Vitamin D is essential to help the body absorb calcium   from food. Low levels of vitamin D can result in serious problems.
Alan Silman, the medical director of Arthritis Research UK, said, ""When the days are sunny, go out for a few minutes and expose your face and arms to the sunshine."" But he also had a warning on overexposure. ""Don't allow your skin to go red, and take care not to burn, particularly in strong sunshine and if you have fair or sensitive skin. From June to August, just 15 minutes is generally enough time.""
""In less sunny months,"" Alan Silman added, ""we recommend that people add more vitamin D in their diet by eating more oily fish such as salmon, tuna, and foods rich in vitamin D, such as cereals  ."" 
 Question:Lack of vitamin D may cause the following problems EXCEPT   _  . 
A. bone loss 
B. muscle function problems 
C. rickets in children. 
D. high blood pressure

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. ""

A. a close friend 
B. a stranger 
C. a classmate

Context: Up to 90% of school leavers in major Asian cities are suffering from myopia ---short-sightedness, a study suggests. Researchers say the ""extraordinary rise"" in the problem is being caused by students working very hard in school and missing out on outdoor light.
Eye experts say that you are short-sighted if your vision is blurred  beyond 2m. It is often caused by an elongation  of the eyeball that happens when people are young. According to the research, the problem is being caused by a combination of factors - a commitment to education and lack of outdoor light.
Professor Morgan who led this study argues that many children in South East Asia spend long hours studying at school and doing their homework. This in itself puts pressure on the eyes, but exposure to between two and three hours of daylight helps maintain healthy eyes.
Cultural factors also seem to play a part. Across many parts of South East Asia, children often have a lunchtime nap. According to Professor Morgan they are missing out on natural light to prevent short-sightedness.
A big concern is the numbers of the students suffering from ""high"" myopia. One in five of these students could experience severe visual impairment  and even blindness. These people are at considerable risk--sometimes people are not told about it and are just given more powerful glasses--they need to be warned about the risk and given some self-testing measures so they can get to an ophthalmologist and get some help.
For decades, researchers believed there was a strong genetic component to the condition. But this study strongly suggests an alternative view. ""Any type of simple genetic explanation just doesn't fit with that speed of change; gene pools just don't change in two generations. Whether it's a purely environmental effect or an environmental effect playing a sensitive genome, it really doesn't matter, the thing that's changed is not the gene pool---it's the environment."" 
 Question:Which of the following statements do you think agrees with Professor Morgan? 
A. A lunchtime nap is helpful in reducing myopia. 
B. Glasses keep myopia from getting even worse. 
C. It's necessary to treat myopia with an operation. 
D. It's of vital importance to reduce educational pressure. 
 Answer: D
Context: Wearing the wrong type of glasses will do harm to your eyes. Incorrect glasses may not be good for the children under 10. You may see better with glasses that are specially made for you.
Watching too much television may be bad for your eyes. This is not true for everyone. People with easily affected eyes may find they get red and achy   from watching TV for long. Carrots will help you see in the dark. Carrots are rich in beta-carotene (b). The body can change beta-carotene into vitamin A, and too little beta-carotene can cause night blindness. However, a lot of research shows that night blindness is more likely to be connected with some other vision problems. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE? 
A. Eating too many carrots can cause night blindness. 
B. Watching too much TV may do harm to everyone. 
C. Wearing wrong glasses may do harm to children's eyes. 
D. The human body is unable to change beta-carotene into vitamin 
 Answer: C
Context: If your mother told you to eat carrots so you'd be able to see in the dark, she was right. It turns out that feeding kids carrots is just one of a number of things to keep eyes healthy. Other things include regular eye exams, and sunglasses or hats are also very helpful, experts say.
While eye disease is sometimes hereditary , some are still preventable , said Dr. Ron Weber, an Atlanta-based ophthalmologist. For example, nearsightedness, ""not only has a genetic  component but is also influenced by how kids use their eyes during childhood,"" he told Reuters Health by phone.
He said that extended close work, such as reading, has long been thought to cause nearsightedness. Recent support has come from a study in which people with a higher level of education were more likely to have nearsightedness, because they spend more time reading or working on computers. Another study showed that children who spend more time outdoors are less likely to become nearsighted.
But these findings don't mean kids should be stopped from reading or working on the computer. Instead, Weber suggests, make sure a child's environment is bright enough while they are doing close work. Parents should also help kids get into the habit of holding their reading material at the perfect distance - about 18 to 22 inches, he said. Finally, taking a break every five minutes or so, to let the eyes relax and focus on an object in the distance, will also help.
One of the most important things a parent can do to help _ eye disease and vision problems is to make sure their child gets regular eye exams, beginning early in life. ""The majority of vision problems in children are preventable and treatable,"" said Dr. Ida Chung.

Context: It is generally believed that we are getting cleaned when we step under a shower. We are, but we're also giving a home to lots of tiny little creatures we didn't even know about. A showerhead carries thousands of bacteria called Mycobacterium.These can cause problems like coughs and tiredness, and a general feeling of poorliness  . When you turn on the water, the bacteria go from the showerhead onto and into your body.
This is a finding of Norman R. Pace and his team at the University of Colorado, in the US. The scientists investigated bacteria in all kinds of human environment, including showers.Pace's team looked at 45 showerheads in nine American cities. They discovered that 30 percent of them had large amounts of flying Mycobacterium.
But Pace said that they _ few threats to the health.Only those with a weak immune system might need to worry.He told the New York Times that the bacteria are not as unpleasant as might be thought.He said that having a shower is no more dangerous than anything else we do in the morning.
But for those who feel sick about the idea of all those microorganisms  , he had some advice. Let the water run for 30 seconds before getting into the shower. Why? The number of bacteria is smaller than that when the water is just turned on. If that seems like a waste of water, he added that you could also change your showerhead every few months.
However, Pace had good news too. He has also been testing the air in US subways. Apart from iron particles  , which are ground off the track by the wheels of trains, subway air is fresh. The reason is that a train's movement pumps fresh outdoor air into the tunnels.
Pace explained that he wanted to understand the natural microbial environments of public places. This kind of knowledge might help discover the microbes to be used in a bioterrorist   attack. 
 Question:From the finding of Norman R. Pace, after taking a shower, we might cough or feel tired because  _  . 
A. it's easy to get a cold when taking a bath 
B. the showerhead carries many bacteria causing illness 
C. we don't get cleaned while showering 
D. we don't get a weak immune system

Context: You may get a cold sometimes. It often starts with a sore throat. You sneeze   and your nose runs. You usually have a headache, too. Often you have a cough later. It's not a serious illness, but you may feel quite bad.
 _ For example, you can take aspirin   to get rid of   your headache. It is good to rest and drink a lot of water, too. A doctor once told me, ""With the right medicine, the cold will last for seven days. With no medicine, it will go on for a week!""
Where does our medicine come from? A long time ago, people knew that some plants made them feel better. For example, the juice of lemons   makes a sore throat better. Now, scientists find some parts of plants can make some medicine. Because of these medicines, people now live longer than their grandparents.

Context: Doctors in hospital emergency rooms often see accidental poisonings . A frightened parent arrives with a child who swallowed a cleaning liquid. Or perhaps the harmful substance is a medicine. Or it might be a chemical product meant to kill insects. These are common causes of accidental poisoning.
In cases like this, look for medical help as soon as possible. Save the container of whatever caused the poisoning. And look on the container for information about anything that stops the effects of the poison. Save anything expelled   from the mouth of the victim. That way, doctors can examine it.
In the past, some people forced poisoning victims to empty the stomach. They used a liquid syrup of ipecac   to do this. But an organization of children's doctors no longer advises parents to keep syrup of ipecac. The American Academy of Pediatrics says some poisons can cause additional damage when they come back up the throat.
Millions of people know a way to save a person who is choking on something trapped in the throat. The method is commonly known as the Heimlich Maneuver or abdominal thrusts. The American Red Cross says a rescuer should first hit the person on the back five times between the shoulder bones. These back blows may ease the choking. If the airway is still blocked, the Red Cross suggests pushing hard five times along the victim's abdomen. The abdomen is the area between the chest and the hip   bones.

A. Learning the basics of first aid

Context: There are some strong-minded people that are able to stop smoking today and be free from the addiction the next day. However, some smokers may have to seek help from medication   in order to kick the habit.
     What medication actually does is to reduce the wish to smoke. Some of the medication must be taken with a doctor's guidance. The five most common medications to stop smoking are Bupropion SR, nicotine gum, nicotine inhalers, nicotine nasal spray and nicotine patches. People can buy nicotine gum and nicotine patches in chemists. However, the other medications require a prescription.
     Zyban tablets have been found to be highly effective in curing people of smoking addiction. The tablet needs to be taken whole, without crushing  it, as crushing can lead to side effects. It can be bought on the prescription of a doctor.
     Nicotine patches are filled with nicotine and they are applied to the skin. The skin takes in the nicotine and carries it to the blood stream. The amount of nicotine in these patches is quite limited, not enough to lead to addiction. But you shouldn't take them for dinner. In fact, millions of people have benefited from these nicotine patches.
     Nicotine gum is supposed to be a safer choice. It is used in such a way that it comes into contact with the blood vessels   in the mouth and then releases the nicotine. The nicotine should not go through the stomach; otherwise, it may cause certain side effects.
     These different types of medications have to be taken quite carefully. Do ask your doctor before taking any of these.

A. weaken smokers' wish to smoke 
B. clear away the nicotine in smokers' bodies 
C. only be taken on the prescription of a doctor

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles?

Context: In a unique research cooperation between Stratasys, Education, R&D departments and MIT's Self-Assembly Lab, a new process is being developed, known as 4D Printing.
The 4D printing concept, which allows materials to ""self-assemble  "" into 3D structures, was initially proposed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty member Skylar Tibbits. Tibbits and his team combined a strand   of plastic with a layer made out of ""smart"" material that could self-assemble in water. They advanced this concept by creating materials that can change into several different complicated shapes, though this kind of material remains the bottleneck of 4D technology.
To many people that are just starting to get used to the idea of 3D printers, the name 4D is causing confusion because they cannot understand where this fourth ""dimension"" coming from. 4D technology shares many of the same principles of 3D printing and is essentially still about creating a new, 3D structure out of certain component; however, Tibbits states the fourth dimension at work here comes from concept of the fourth dimension of time. The difference between these 3D and 4D creations is that these new forms have the ability to transform and adapt over time.
4D printing works through self-assembly -- a system where ""disordered elements form an ""ordered"" structure via an interaction. With these 4D printed materials, these disordered materials are strands or sheets of specially designed materials. Environmental changes then stimulate  a response from them so that they form a preprogrammed shape.
The idea of having adaptable technology that only relies on energy and non-human interactions raises some interesting questions about where 4D printing can be used and the practical applications in dangerous environments. This could mean improved infrastructures in extreme conditions, leading to a reduced need for workers to put themselves at risk, but the potential goes even further than that. The technology promises exciting new possibilities for a variety of applications. A solar panel or similar product could be produced in a flat shape onto which functional devices can be easily installed. It could then be changed to a compact shape for packing and shipping. After arriving at its destination, the product could be stimulated to form a different shape that serves its function. Also it could be used to build furniture, bikes, cars and even buildings. As with many of the ideas being put forward, it is easy to go a step too far into the extreme, but this just shows the potential of 4D in comparison to 3D.
The next stage for the research is to move from printing single strands to sheets and eventually whole structures. And water need not be the process ' s only energy source. 
 Question:The major problem concerning the development of 4D printing lies in   _  . 
A. producing essential 4D printers 
B. creating proper smart materials 
C. providing a suitable environment 
D. promoting practical applications

Context: For centuries, medical pioneers have refined a variety of methods and medicines to treat sickness, injury, and disability, enabling people to live longer and healthier lives.
""A salamander (a small lizard-like animal) can grow back its leg. Why can't a human do the same?"" asked Peruvian-born surgeon Dr. Anthony Atala in a recent interview. The question, a reference to work aiming to grow new limbs for wounded soldiers, captures the inventive spirit of regenerative medicine. This innovative field seeks to provide patients with replacement body parts.
These parts are not made of steel; they are the real things --- living cells, tissue, and even organs.
Regenerative medicine is still mostly experimental, with clinical applications limited to procedures such as growing sheets of skin on burns and wounds. One of its most significant advances took place in 1999,when a research group at North Carolina's Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine conducted a successful organ replacement with a laboratory-grown bladder. Since then, the team, led by Dr. Atala, has continued to generate a variety of other tissues and organs  from kidneys to ears.
The field of regenerative medicine builds on work conducted in the early twentieth century with the first successful transplants of donated human soft tissue and bone. However, donor organs are not always the best option. First of all, they are in short supply, and many people die while waiting for an available organ; in the United States alone, more than 100,000 people are waiting for organ transplants. Secondly, a patient's body may ultimately reject the transplanted donor organ. An advantage of regenerative medicine is that the tissues are grown from a patient's own cells and will not be rejected by the body's immune system.
Today, several labs are working to create bioartificial body parts. Scientists at Columbia and Yale Universities have grown a jawbone and a lung. At the University of Minnesota, Doris Taylor has created a beating bioartificial rat heart. Dr. Atala's medical team has reported long-term success with bioengineered bladders implanted into young patients with spina bifida (a birth defect that involves the incomplete development of the spinal cord). And at the University of Michigan, H. David Humes has created an artificial kidney.
So far, the kidney procedure has only been used successfully with sheep, but there is hope that one day similar kidney will be implantable in a human patient. The continuing research of scientists such as these may eventually make donor organs unnecessary and, as a result, significantly increase individuals' chances of survival.

Context: One baby born with a defective windpipe   now has hope of breathing normally thanks to 3-D printing technology, NPR reported.
Garrett Peterson, now 18 months old, was born with tracheomalacia  , leaving him unable to breathe. The condition terrified his parents, who turned to specialist Dr. Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment.
Along with Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer who runs the university's 3-D printing lab, Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett's windpipe until it's strong enough to function independently. After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the ""splint"" with a 3-D printer.
""It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,"" Green told NPR.
On January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs?
Though he still remains in the hospital, Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery.  His parents are overjoyed, saying he's starting to act more interactive and alert.
As Garrett grows, the splint will expand and eventually dissolve in his body as his own windpipe strengthens enough to work independently.
3-D printing technology has allowed doctors to help patients in ways that they hope will continue to grow.
""We're talking about taking something like dust and converting it into body parts,"" Green said. ""And we're able to do things that were never possible before.""

Context: Recently hand-foot-mouth disease has spread across China. In the past three months, there have been about 41,846 cases   in 30 provinces and regions. The number is increasing. Eighteen Chinese children have died of the disease so far this year.
What causes the disease and why is it dangerous?
Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common childhood illness. It mainly affects children under the age of 10. It gets its name from the rash   that develops on the hands and feet. It can also cause blisters   in your mouth.
A child who has the disease will usually have a fever, a runny nose and sore throat. He or she doesn't want to eat or drink because of pain in the mouth.
Hand-foot-mouth disease is mostly not serious. The fever and rash clear within a few days. But in some cases, the virus   affects the heart, lungs or brain. This puts the child's life in danger.
A virus causes hand-foot-mouth disease. The disease spreads easily where a lot of young children are together, such as in a child-care center. Sometimes it can also affect teenagers and adults.
In order not to pass on the virus, good hygiene   is important. We should wash our hands as often as possible. Especially we should wash our hands before meals and after going to the toilet. 
 Question:_   can help us to keep away from the hand-foot-mouth disease. 
A. Passing on the virus 
B. Taking children to the child-care center 
C. Keeping your hands clean 
D. Not going to public places 
 Answer: C
Context: The World Health Organization (WHO) planned to study the relationship between the eating habits of the people and the disease. Two doctors were chosen to make the study. They flew to Africa south of the Sahara and during the next two months visited ten countries. They found that serious diseases of poor eating, often mistaken for other diseases, existed in all parts of Africa. The diseases were similar and could therefore all be named kwashiorkor. The diseased children are usually from one to four years old. As the illness progresses, the child's stomach becomes swollen by liquid collecting in the body. The skin changes color and may break out in open sores . The hair changes color and starts to fall out. The patient loses all interest in his surroundings and even in food, and becomes so weak that he wants to lie down all the time. Stomach liquids are no longer produced.
The doctors reasoned that kwashiorkor was found in the young children of this age in many parts of Africa because of lack of milk or meat. Their mothers, after stopping their breastfeeding, gave them foods full of starches instead of greatly needed proteins. They found that the addition of milk to the food of the children suffering from kwashiorkor saved many lives.
The unbelievable thing about kwashiorkor is that the very existence of the disease--which has been killing thousands of children for centuries--was not even recognized in Latin America as recently as ten years ago. The deaths of those children were mistakenly listed as due to other diseases. It was the WHO's work in Africa that led to the discovery of the problem in Central America. 
 Question:It is difficult to discover kwashiorkor because   _   . 
A. it has no symptoms at all 
B. it is hard to identify signs of it 
C. it doesn't last long enough for careful observation 
D. it is hardly different from other diseases

Context: Read the following interview with Dr John Bass, an international shark  specialist who has spent many years studying sharks:
First of all, doctor, are all sharks dangerous?
  No, they aren't. There are about 250 different kinds of sharks, but fewer than 30 of them are dangerous to humans. Certain sharks are very aggressive   and we should fear them, but the danger of shark attacks is much lower than most people think.
  So which sharks are dangerous?
  The Great White shark is the most dangerous. Then there is the Tiger shark, which other sharks are afraid of, and the Blue shark. Both of them are very fast and dangerous.
  Which are the biggest and smallest sharks?
  The Whale shark is the biggest shark in the world. It grows up to 15 m in length and weighs as much as six large cars. The smallest shark, which is found near prefix = st1 /Japan, could fit into the palm of your hand because it is only 15-20 cm long.
  Do all sharks have teeth ?
  Yes, they do. Most sharks have hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of sharp teeth. These are arranged in rows of four or more. They fit quite loosely in the jaw. When the front ones break off or fall out, spare teeth move forwards from the rows behind: Sharks get a new set of teeth every two weeks. In 10 years, a Tiger may lose as many as 24,000 teeth!
  That's lots of teeth! What kind of food do sharks eat?
  Most sharks feed on small fish, and they keep the oceans healthy by eating sick and injured fish. However, hungry sharks will eat almost anything, including smaller sharks and even rubbish. Inside one Tiger shark which was found, there was a tin can, a bicycle tyre , a leather wallet and an alarm clock!
  And how do sharks find their food, doctor?
  A shark's sense of smell is excellent. It will follow the smell of blood across thousands of metres of ocean. They also see well, and they have good hearing. Sharks can feel movement in water very easily too, and it is possible for them to feel a fish moving as far as 30 m away. 
 Question:Most types of sharks are   _  . 
A. dangerous killers 
B. not dangerous 
C. afraid of people 
D. found inJapan

Context: Here is a story told about an American general who was a very important figure in the American army during the First World War. Everybody in the United States knew him and many people wished to have a picture or something of his in their homes.
Soon after the war the general returned to Washington. One day he went to a dentist and had six teeth pulled out. A week later the general heard that his teeth were being sold in curiosity shops as $ 5 each. On each of the teeth there was a label with the name of the general and words: ""Buy these teeth and show them to your friends at home."" The general got angry. He rushed to his office and ordered six officers to go around the city and buy all his teeth.
The officers went out and visited every curiosity shop in the capital. They were away from the office all day. In the evening they returned and put on the table in front of the general the teeth they had bought. They had collected 175 teeth.

Context: Every living thing on Earth is either a plant or an animal, right? Wrong! Many organisms in our world are neither. Some of them float through the air, and some lie hidden in the ground. They do not need sunlight to survive, and if the weather becomes too cold, they can become inactive until conditions improve.
What are these? They are called fungi , and you see them almost every day. Many kinds of fungi seem _ , such as the green black things that appear on the food which are left too long in the refrigerator. But other kinds are not so bad. For example, the yeast that is used to make bread and mushrooms   are both fungi.
What makes fungi different from plants and animals? An animal can move around by itself. Fungi get around too, but they don't have feet, wings, or tails. They have to wait for wind or some other outside force to move them. Plants are different from fungi because they have chlorophyll . It helps them make food from the energy in sunlight. Fungi do not have chlorophyll.
Some fungi are bad, while others are not. Some fungi cause diseases, such as athlete's foot, which makes feet uncomfortable. Other kinds of fungi can be used to make medicines, which have saved many lives.
Fungi clean up more than wounds, though. They are the world's first recyclers. Without fungi, our world would be a mess. Since fungi cannot make their own food as plants do, they must get their food elsewhere. Many fungi get their food from dead plants. They break them down and turn them into soil. The fungi get a meal, and the world gets a housecleaning. 
 Question:According to the passage,   _  . 
A. fungi can move everywhere by themselves 
B. fungi are unable to survive in cold conditions 
C. some fungi can make food from the energy in sunlight. 
D. some fungi are useful to humans and the environment

Context: It is generally believed that we are getting cleaned when we step under a shower. We are, but we're also giving a home to lots of tiny little creatures we didn't even know about. A showerhead carries thousands of bacteria called Mycobacterium.These can cause problems like coughs and tiredness, and a general feeling of poorliness  . When you turn on the water, the bacteria go from the showerhead onto and into your body.
This is a finding of Norman R. Pace and his team at the University of Colorado, in the US. The scientists investigated bacteria in all kinds of human environment, including showers.Pace's team looked at 45 showerheads in nine American cities. They discovered that 30 percent of them had large amounts of flying Mycobacterium.
But Pace said that they _ few threats to the health.Only those with a weak immune system might need to worry.He told the New York Times that the bacteria are not as unpleasant as might be thought.He said that having a shower is no more dangerous than anything else we do in the morning.
But for those who feel sick about the idea of all those microorganisms  , he had some advice. Let the water run for 30 seconds before getting into the shower. Why? The number of bacteria is smaller than that when the water is just turned on. If that seems like a waste of water, he added that you could also change your showerhead every few months.
However, Pace had good news too. He has also been testing the air in US subways. Apart from iron particles  , which are ground off the track by the wheels of trains, subway air is fresh. The reason is that a train's movement pumps fresh outdoor air into the tunnels.
Pace explained that he wanted to understand the natural microbial environments of public places. This kind of knowledge might help discover the microbes to be used in a bioterrorist   attack. 
 Question:From the finding of Norman R. Pace, after taking a shower, we might cough or feel tired because  _  . 
A. it's easy to get a cold when taking a bath 
B. the showerhead carries many bacteria causing illness 
C. we don't get cleaned while showering 
D. we don't get a weak immune system

Context: We see 3D movies, games, TVs, and so on. Do you hear of  3D newspapers? Yes, here is a kind of newspaper from Belgian. And it was born  on March 3rd, 2010. This is the first 3D newspaper in the world.
Huber Leklein with his friends began to make the 3D newspaper in January,2010. They worked really hard. And they finished   in March.
If you buy this newspaper ,you can get a pair of free  3D glasses. All the pictures and ads  in the newspaper are in 3D,but the articles  are not in 3D.You can read this 3D newspaper by holding(  ) the newspaper 50cm away from the eyes. In fact, if people don't wear the 3D glasses, they can't read the newspaper very well because the pictures and words in it are not clear.
People like reading 3D newspaper very much. But Hubert Lekein and his friends don't want to continue  with it because they spent too much money and time.

Context: For many men, the idea that they have a better sense of direction than women has been improved by a scientific study.
Researchers from Norway scanned on the brains of volunteers as they completed navigation   tasks to discover men are more skillful at finding their way because they use a separate part of their brain. According to lead researcher Dr. Cal Pintzka from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), men and women have different navigational strategies.
Med use basic directions--the use of north, south, east and west--during navigation to a greater degree. Men's sense of direction was more effective. They quite simply got to their destination faster. ""If they're going to the Students Society building in Trodheim, for example, men usually go into the general direction where it is located."" Dr. Pintzka explained.
Women usually orient   themselves along a route to get there, for example, go past the hairdresser and then up the street and turn right after the shore.
The study shows that using the basic directions is more efficient because it is a more flexible strategy. The destination can be reached faster because the strategy depends less on where you start.
Meanwhile, the study also shows both men and women use large areas of the brain when they navigate, but some areas were different. The man used the hippocampus   more, whereas women use their frontal areas to a greater extent. That degrees with the fact that the hippocampus is necessary to make use of basic directions. Losing one's sense of direction is one of the first symptoms in Alzheimer's disease.
Understanding how men and women use different brain areas and strategies to navigate, researchers will be able to enhance the understand of the disease's development, and develop coping strategies for those already affected. 
 Question:Why is men's strategy more efficient? 
A. Because it is much easier to be carried out. 
B. Because it is more helpful to identify roads. 
C. Because it is simpler for telling directions. 
D. Because it is less limited by the starting place.

Context: For centuries, medical pioneers have refined a variety of methods and medicines to treat sickness, injury, and disability, enabling people to live longer and healthier lives.
""A salamander (a small lizard-like animal) can grow back its leg. Why can't a human do the same?"" asked Peruvian-born surgeon Dr. Anthony Atala in a recent interview. The question, a reference to work aiming to grow new limbs for wounded soldiers, captures the inventive spirit of regenerative medicine. This innovative field seeks to provide patients with replacement body parts.
These parts are not made of steel; they are the real things --- living cells, tissue, and even organs.
Regenerative medicine is still mostly experimental, with clinical applications limited to procedures such as growing sheets of skin on burns and wounds. One of its most significant advances took place in 1999,when a research group at North Carolina's Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine conducted a successful organ replacement with a laboratory-grown bladder. Since then, the team, led by Dr. Atala, has continued to generate a variety of other tissues and organs  from kidneys to ears.
The field of regenerative medicine builds on work conducted in the early twentieth century with the first successful transplants of donated human soft tissue and bone. However, donor organs are not always the best option. First of all, they are in short supply, and many people die while waiting for an available organ; in the United States alone, more than 100,000 people are waiting for organ transplants. Secondly, a patient's body may ultimately reject the transplanted donor organ. An advantage of regenerative medicine is that the tissues are grown from a patient's own cells and will not be rejected by the body's immune system.
Today, several labs are working to create bioartificial body parts. Scientists at Columbia and Yale Universities have grown a jawbone and a lung. At the University of Minnesota, Doris Taylor has created a beating bioartificial rat heart. Dr. Atala's medical team has reported long-term success with bioengineered bladders implanted into young patients with spina bifida (a birth defect that involves the incomplete development of the spinal cord). And at the University of Michigan, H. David Humes has created an artificial kidney.
So far, the kidney procedure has only been used successfully with sheep, but there is hope that one day similar kidney will be implantable in a human patient. The continuing research of scientists such as these may eventually make donor organs unnecessary and, as a result, significantly increase individuals' chances of survival.

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. ""

Context: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog.
Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation.
""The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,"" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery.
The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are ""extremely difficult, if not impossible"" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said.
The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face.
The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants,
Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue.
Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality
There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers.
Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant. 
 Question:The best title for the passage would be   _  . 
A. French Woman has First Partial Face Transplant 
B. First Face Transplant Opens Debate 
C. Risks and Ethical Problems of a Face Transplant 
D. A Complete Face Transplant of a French Woman

Context: Today we find that school students hardly spend much time on sports. Is it because they aren't interested in sports? No, they often say they have other important things to do.
What are these important things? Tests! They have to spend much time on all kinds of tests at school. So many of them almost become bookworms  . Books stop them from going out for sports. Because of the _ from their parents and teachers, the students have to work harder and spend most of their time on books. As for the students, they want to get good results in order to improve their studies. So it is necessary for them to give all of their free time to their studies and stop their school sports.

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle?

Context: Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do. 
 Question:Ray Birdwhistell believes that physical appearance   _  . 
A. has little to do with culture 
B. has much to do with culture 
C. is ever changing 
D. is different from place to place 
 Answer: B
Context: Do you know why people look the way they look? What inside our bodies makes us grow in a certain way? The answer is DNA. It was first discovered by a young Swiss doctor in 1868.
DNA is like a computer program for your body. Almost every cell  in your body includes DNA. The way DNA in the cell decides why you are the way you are. For example your friend might have larger ears than you. This is because their DNA is different from yours.
DNA lives in the cell and is ordered in a structure called a ""double helix "". In each double helix there are links called as chromosomes . These chromosomes are made from four bases that arrange themselves in millions of different ways. The way these bases choose to line up is what makes the DNA code for that cell.
DNA is also called a ""gene "". This is a very interesting thing. Genes are passed down from your parents. That is why you might have the same smile like your dad's or mom's!
In February, scientists found the skeleton  of Richard III, King of England from 1483-1485, under a car park in England. It seems unlikely that scientists could identify a 527-year-old skeleton. However, they matched the skeleton's DNA to a sample from one of his direct descendants . How amazing! 
 Question:What is the main function of ""genes""? 
A. They decide your children's appearances or characters. 
B. They make your children have the same smile as you. 
C. They make your children stay healthy. 
D. They're good for scientific researches. 
 Answer: A
Context: A previously unknown kind of human group disappeared from the world so completely that it has left behind the merest piece of evidence that it ever existed -- a single bone from the little finger of a child, buried in a cave in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia. 
    Researchers removed DNA from the bone and reported that it differed obviously from that of both modern humans and of Neanderthals , living in Europe until the arrival of modern humans on the continent some 44,000 years ago. 
    The child carrying the DNA line was probably 5 to 7 years old, but it is not yet known if it was a boy or a girl. The finger bone was unearthed in 2008 from a place known as the Denisova cave. 
    Researchers are careful not to call the Denisova child a new human species, though it may prove to be so, because the evidence is initial. 
    But the genetic material removed from the bone, found in a layer laid down on the cave floor between 48,000 and 30,000 years ago, belonged to a distinct human line that traveled out of Africa at a different time from the two known ancient human species. Homo erectus , found in East Asia, left Africa two million years ago, and the ancestor of Neanderthals moved away some 500,000 years ago. The numbers of differences found in the child's DNA indicate that its ancestors left Africa about one million years ago. 
    The region was inhabited by both Neanderthals and modern humans at that time. Counting the new human line, three human species may have lived together. 
The standard view has long been that there were three human resettlements out of Africa -- those of Homo erectus; of the ancestor of Neanderthals; and finally, some 50,000 years ago, of modern humans. But in 2004, archaeologists reported that they had found the bones of small humans who lived on the Indonesian island of Flores until 13,000 years ago, causing a serious problem to this view. The new line is the second such challenge. 
If the nuclear DNA of the Denisova child should differ as much as its mitochondrial  DNA does from that of Neanderthals and modern humans, the case for declaring it a new species would be strengthened. But it would be unusual for a new species to be recognized on the basis of DNA alone. 
In new diggings starting this summer, archaeologists will look for remains more analytical than the finger bone. Researchers will also begin re-examining the fossil collections in museums to see if any wrongly assigned bones might belong instead to the new line. 
 Question:Which human line is the first challenge to the standard view of human resettlement? 
A. Neanderthals. 
B. Modern humans. 
C. Homo erectus. 
D. Small humans in Indonesia.

Context: Today, the biggest killers stem as much from our lifestyles as from bacteria and viruses.  One of the worst of these is heart disease, and specifically high blood pressure. It's a slow, but efficient killer that robs many people of what should be the last 10, 20 or 30 years of their lives.
Scientists are claiming that they have now separated unusual ingredients in a rare seaweed discovered by fishermen off the coast of Korea that offer incredible health benefits--including the ability to restore blood pressure to normal levels.
Dr. Haengwoo Lee, a famous biochemist conducted a clinical study on these two ingredients. The first is Seanol, an extremely rare seaweed extract  from Ecklonia Cava that's proven to be 100 times more powerful than any land-based antioxidant . That's because it stays working in your body for 12 hours, compared to land-based antioxidants that work for 30 minutes.  ""Its secret is its make-up of special chemicals that are a huge 40% fat soluble( ),"" Dr. Lee explains. ""Unlike nearly all land-based antioxidants that are water soluble, Seanol's protective compounds can get into things like the fatty tissues of your brain and penetrate  all three layers of your cells, including the outside, the oil-based cell membranes , and your DNA."" Indeed, Seanol is so powerful, it's the only FDA-approved Ecklonia Cava marine-algae    extract in existence.
The second ingredient is Calamarine, a deep-sea omega-3 discovery that delivers 85% more DHA omega-3s to your heart, brain, joints, and eyes. It's known to reduce the problems from tiredness and poor memory, joint pain, mood swings and depression.
With that research in mind, Dr. Lee combined Seanol and Calamarine with a high dose of vitamin D to form  Marine-D3, the newest supplement in the fight against age-related illnesses and high blood pressure.
Dr. Lee found that Calamarine delivers some of the greatest concentration of omega-3s known to science. Combined with Seanol's ability to reduce body inflammation , as well as help cells get the nutrients they need to thrive, stay healthy and protected, Marine-D3 is able to boost a body's entire well being.
The makers of Marine-D3 are so confident that you'll see fast dramatic results from this product, that if you aren't happy after two full months, simply return the unused portion and they'll buy it back. They'll even give you ten dollars extra just for giving it an honest try! That kind of faith, combined with Dr. Lee's exhaustive research, shows that Marine-D3 really is a one-of-a-kind product. 
 Question:What's the makers' attitude toward Marine-D3? 
A. pessimistic 
B. indifferent 
C. doubtful 
D. Optimistic 
 Answer: D
Context: Every heard the old saying, ""An apple a day keeps the doctor away""? It is true! Apples have a lot of nutritional value!
A medium sized apple has only 80 calories  . What a great snack choice! Not only is an apple low in calories, they contain absolutely no fat. Thus, eating apples as snacks, as opposed to chips or cakes, will help reduce the risk of cancer.
On top of reducing the risk of cancer, the low sodium   amounts in apples also help reduce high blood pressure and heart disease. They are cholesterol   free. They are also rich in vitamin A, which helps strengthen vision   along with bone and tooth development.
Now that we know the nutritional facts, let's take a look at some of the fun facts--That's right! Apples can be fun, as well as healthy!
If an apple is fresh, it will float on water. Twenty-five percent of an apple is air, thus allowing it to float. Can you imagine bobbing   for apples that sink?
And, did you know that an apple is covered with a natural layer of wax  ? That's what the peeling   is. It protects the apple's high water content, keeping the apple fresh.
Apples are a very important part of a healthy diet, but keep in mind they can be fun. And always remember, if an apple sinks in water, pick another one to bob for! 
 Question:Why do apples stay fresh for a long time? 
A. Because they contain much water. 
B. Because they have peeling with a layer of wax. 
C. Because they contain much air. 
D. Because they have peeling with nutritional value. 
 Answer: B

Context: Nowadays, the food we eat seems to have great effects on our health. Although science has made enormous steps in making food more fit to eat, it has, at the same time, made many foods unfit to eat. Some research has shown that perhaps eighty percent of all human illnesses are related to diet and forty percent of cancer is related to the diet as well, especially cancer of the colon. Different cultures are more likely to cause certain different illnesses because of the food that is characteristic in these cultures.
That food is related to illness is not a new discovery. In 1945, about 68 years ago, government researchers realized that nitrates, commonly used to preserve color in meats, and other food additives, caused cancer. Yet, these carcinogenic additives remain in our food, and it becomes more difficult all the time to know which things on the packaging labels of processed food are helpful or harmful. The additives which we eat are not all so direct. Farmers often give penicillin to beef and living animals, and because of this, penicillin has been found in the milk of treated cow. Sometimes similar drugs are given to animals not for medical purposes, but for financial reasons. The farmers are simply trying to fatten the animals in order to obtain a higher price on the market. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has tried repeatedly to control these procedures, the practices continue.

Context: A person who is deaf when he is born is usually dumb   as well. There may be nothing wrong with his mouth and tongue, but he cannot speak. This is because he cannot hear people, so he has nothing to imitate  . He may try to make sounds himself, but cannot hear his own voice. However, even though he finds it difficult to speak and cannot hear, he can learn to read. Nowadays such persons can also be taught to speak because we have modern methods and equipment, but we did not have these when Helen Keller was born.
     Even with modern methods and equipment, however, it is not easy for deaf children to learn to speak, though most of them succeed. When a child is deaf and blind as well, it becomes much more difficult, though it is possible. Helen Keller was born in 1880. She became very ill at the age of nineteen months. Medical knowledge was not as great then as it is now. She did not die but lost her sight and hearing. As a result, she became dumb as well. Her parents did their best to teach her, but she couldn't speak by the age of six.
     Then, in 1887, a teacher, Miss Sullivan, came to live with her. Miss Sullivan herself had been blind. She had been partly cured. Though she could not see very well, she was not blind. Helen was a difficult pupil at first, but in a month Helen had learned how to understand signs and how to make them herself. At last in spite of her great difficulties, Helen learned to read, write and speak, even though she was deaf and blind. She even went to college and had full education. She wrote many books, and though other people have written books about her, her own books are the ones that best explain how it feels to be deaf, dumb and blind. Her best book is The Story of My Life. Perhaps you have read it. Though it was written in 1902, it is still a very interesting book. Even if you have not read it, you may have heard of Helen Keller. 
 Question:A person who is deaf at birth is also dumb because   _  . 
A. there's something wrong with his mouth and tongue 
B. he cannot hear other people and he has nothing to imitate 
C. he doesn't like to speak 
D. he cannot hear his own voice

Context: It had been three months since Ms Miller had started teaching. She was gradually being able to understand all her students,except one,Bob. Bob was the only boy who came to school dressed untidily and sat in the class completely lost in his own world. His performance had been  _ steadily with every single day.
    Ms Miller searched through the progress reports of Bob and was shocked to see Bob used to be the topper in his class. Bob's performance began to slowly decline when his mother fell ill.He was doing badly in each and every subject when his mother died leaving him alone with his father,who was a businessman and had to travel always. Apart from his performance worsening gradually,Bob's nature too began to change. He had forgotten to laugh and showed no interest in any activity. All his friends had abandoned him.
    One day,Bob was asked to stay back. Ms Miller asked him if he had any problem understanding his lessons. Gradually she began to give him a comfort zone so that he could talk and share. After three weeks,she found Bob gradually improving. He was being able to answer the questions he previously failed, Every day after all the students went away,Ms Miller gave personal attention to Bob and began to spend time with him. Bob improved a lot over the next semester,showing definite signs of progress in his performance.
     On a Friday,Bob came up to Ms Miller,handed her a box and requested her to open the box on Sunday. Sunday moming,curious,she opened it and saw a bottle of perfume,half filled. Together with it was a small letter,saying that this bottle of perfume used to be his mother's and he wished Ms Miller to wear it so that every time she was around,he could feel his Mom near him. He thanked her for everything. Ms Miller took the bottle of perfume in her hand and saw a new tag attached to it; it said ""Happy Mother's Day"" !
    Ms Miller suddenly realized that it was not she who had made a difference to Bob's life but it was Bob who made her realize what true humanity is !

Context: As a published author with a degree in English, 33-year-old Tom Williams has achieved more than many people will in a lifetime. What makes those achievements more impressive is that he's dyslexic.
At school Tom, who has worked as a literary agent and now has a full-time job with a digital publishing company, would often find keeping up in lessons so tiring that he would fall asleep. ""I found it quite frustrating that everybody else had neat handwriting and could spell and I just couldn't do what they could,"" says Tom, who has written a respected biography of crime writer Raymond Chandler.
It wasn't until the age of 17 that he was given a test for dyslexia that showed why he'd struggled for so long. He was always studying for A-levels including English.
""My teacher didn't think I'd get the grades I was capable of,"" he says. ""So she pushed for me to be tested and I'm grateful that she did.""
Until his diagnosis Tom had been ranked somewhere in the middle of his classes at school. He couldn't understand why assignments would come back covered in red ink. However, after Tom's diagnosis, when his condition began to be taken properly into account, he found himself at the top of the class.
To study English well, he wrote down new words as he came across them and tried to find somewhere quiet and well lit to read and write.
He says people were often surprised that someone with dyslexia wanted to pursue a degree in English. Similarly, when he went to study at University College London, the tutors were initially taken aback at his degree choice.
Not everyone understands dyslexia so well. ""If teachers aren't trained to recognize signs of dyslexia, they'll think children are less able,"" he says. To make sure that doesn't happen and to encourage a deeper understanding of the condition among those affected by it, Tom becomes a supporter of the charity Dyslexia Action. 
 Question:Dyslexia Action is intended to     . 
A. get dyslexia understood better by people 
B. call on more people to help the disabled 
C. promote effective ways of teaching kids with dyslexia 
D. introduce how to use dyslexia to its greatest advantage

Context: Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do. 
 Question:Ray Birdwhistell believes that physical appearance   _  . 
A. has little to do with culture 
B. has much to do with culture 
C. is ever changing 
D. is different from place to place 
 Answer: B
Context: Here's a story about a very interesting family. A young man once went into town and bought himself a pair of trousers. When he got home, he went upstairs  to his bedroom and put them on. He found that they were about two inches too long.
He came downstairs, where his mother and his two sisters were washing up tea things in the kitchen. ""These new trousers are too long."" He said. "" They need shortening  by about two inches. Would one of you mind doing this for me, please?"" His mother and sisters were busy and they said nothing.
But as soon as his mother had finished washing up, she went quietly upstairs to her son's bedroom and shortened the trousers by two inches. She came downstairs without saying anything to her daughters.
Later on, after supper, the elder sister remembered her brother's trousers. She was a kind-hearted girl, so she went quietly upstairs without saying anything to anyone and shortened the trousers by two inches.
The younger sister went to the cinema, but when she came back, she, too, remembered what her brother had said. So she ran upstairs and took two inches off the legs of the new trousers. 
 Question:Who is the last to shorten his new trousers ? 
A. his young sister

C. his elder sister 
D. himself

D. of medium height 
 Answer: D
Context: The size and shape  of your ears show your character more than any other parts of the face. Other parts of the face change shape as we get older, but ears do not change their shape. They only change in size.
Reading people's character from their ears is an old science. In very old times people thought that a person with big ears had a good and generous character. They thought that a person with pale, small ears was dangerous. They also thought that the shape of the ear showed if a person was musical. Today, too many people believe that the size and the shape of the ear help you know if a person is musical.
Ears are all different, and each characteristic has a meaning. Next time when you look at a person, see if his ears are large, medium-size or small. Look at the lobes (the lowest part of the ear). Do they stick to the face? Ears that are always red mean a person may easily get angry, or he / she just has high blood pressure  . Ears that are always cold and pale mean a person has a nervous character. And a big inside hole of the ear means a person is musical. 
 Question:We can guess Beethoven (a world-famous musician) may have. 
A. ears with a big inside hole 
B. round white ears 
C. ears with a hole in the lobes 
D. big red ears

Context: One baby born with a defective windpipe   now has hope of breathing normally thanks to 3-D printing technology, NPR reported.
Garrett Peterson, now 18 months old, was born with tracheomalacia  , leaving him unable to breathe. The condition terrified his parents, who turned to specialist Dr. Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment.
Along with Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer who runs the university's 3-D printing lab, Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett's windpipe until it's strong enough to function independently. After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the ""splint"" with a 3-D printer.
""It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,"" Green told NPR.
On January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs?
Though he still remains in the hospital, Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery.  His parents are overjoyed, saying he's starting to act more interactive and alert.
As Garrett grows, the splint will expand and eventually dissolve in his body as his own windpipe strengthens enough to work independently.
3-D printing technology has allowed doctors to help patients in ways that they hope will continue to grow.
""We're talking about taking something like dust and converting it into body parts,"" Green said. ""And we're able to do things that were never possible before."" 
 Question:According to the passage, doctors' attitude toward 3-D printing technology in medical care is   _  . 
A. positive 
B. negative 
C. unknown 
D. indifferent

Context: Bea, a five-year-old girl, was born with a severe illness which means she has to be kept away from other children of her age, because her body is so weak that she would be unable to fight off a common cold.
Bea was diagnosed with this disease when she was five months old. Since then, the hospital has become her second home, medicines for food, and all kinds of treatments her friends. Bea received a very special treatment when she was four years old, which would allow her to be like a normal child if successful. After that, she spent two weeks in ICU before living for four months on a separate ward . Bea was allowed home in February but still needed a special tube in her nose to send in medicines every two days.
Her parents clean the house from top to bottom every two days and hoover each morning to make sure Bea is free from any possible bacteria. Anna, Bea's mother, said, ""she is weak but so strong. We've never seen any child stronger than her. It seems as if nothing in the world could beat her. We really hope to send her to school next year."" She used to drive on the local playground, but Bea was only allowed to watch sitting in the car. ""It was heartbreaking to see Bea staring at the running and laughing children there. She never stopped fighting the disease. I know she's dying for such a normal life.""
Hearing of Bea's story, the Make-A-Wish Foundation has paid for a play park to be built in her back garden. ""Bea is very brave and she has encouraged many children like her,"" said the chairman of the foundation. 
 Question:If Bea stayed with other children freely,_. 
A. other children would have a higher chance to catch her disease 
B. she would catch a common cold which would kill her quickly 
C. her life would be in great danger as she could fall ill easily

Context: A mom in Australia was told by a doctor that her newborn son was ""dead"",but she helped bring him back to life  by holding the baby against her body. She used a method known as ""kangaroo care "".The child,named Jamie,was born after only 27 weeks with his twin sister,Emily,at a hospital in Sydney.Her birth went well,but his was a different story.The doctor struggled for 20 minutes to save him before declaring him dead.
""His little arms and legs were just falling down away from his body,"" Kate Ogg said.""I took my coat off and put him on my chest with his head over my arm."" She and her husband,David,spoke to the child as she continued to hold him for nearly two hours.During that time,the twopound baby showed signs of life.She said,""I told my mom,who was there,that he was still alive.Then he held out his hand and grabbed my finger.""
The doctor at first ignored the baby's movements,but when he put the stethoscope   to its chest,his mouth fell wide open and he said,""It's my fault.It's a miracle  .""
""The care helps the baby keep body warmth,"" Dr Pinchi Srinivasan said.""It also regulates   heart and breathing rates and is believed to help weight gain and improve sleeping habits.Fathers can also use 'kangaroo care'.The key to the method is skintoskin contact."" 
The practice began in less developed nations.It has become a recognized practice in helping premature _ babies.The technique is good for babies,and is used in many baby care units. 
 Question:When the baby first showed signs of life,the doctor  _  . 
A. didn't believe a miracle  had happened 
B. was too shocked to do anything 
C. was cheered and tried to save the baby at once

Context: Recently hand-foot-mouth disease has spread across China. In the past three months, there have been about 41,846 cases   in 30 provinces and regions. The number is increasing. Eighteen Chinese children have died of the disease so far this year.
What causes the disease and why is it dangerous?
Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common childhood illness. It mainly affects children under the age of 10. It gets its name from the rash   that develops on the hands and feet. It can also cause blisters   in your mouth.
A child who has the disease will usually have a fever, a runny nose and sore throat. He or she doesn't want to eat or drink because of pain in the mouth.
Hand-foot-mouth disease is mostly not serious. The fever and rash clear within a few days. But in some cases, the virus   affects the heart, lungs or brain. This puts the child's life in danger.
A virus causes hand-foot-mouth disease. The disease spreads easily where a lot of young children are together, such as in a child-care center. Sometimes it can also affect teenagers and adults.
In order not to pass on the virus, good hygiene   is important. We should wash our hands as often as possible. Especially we should wash our hands before meals and after going to the toilet.

Context: Different from popular thoughts, colds are not caused by bad weather. Colds are caused by viruses  in the body, and you are better out on the snowy day than you are in a warm room, with your friends, who just may be passing the virus around. If you feel a chill   when you are coming down with a cold, you are already sick. A chill is an early sign of the cold.
The virus can spread through air when a cold - sufferer  coughs or sneezes. Surprisingly, this is not the most usual way of spreading, Many studies have now shown that most colds are "" caught "" by hands. A cold - sufferer rubs her nose, so spreading the virus to her hand. Then a friend comes to visit her. They shake their hands. The friend then gets something to eat by hand, and several days later she catches a cold. Although some parents pick up their children's tissues   and carefully throw them away, they fail to wash their hands. They'll catch the colds, too.
Cold viruses can also be spread by objects, for example, telephones, plates. The cold - sufferer as well as other members of the house, by washing their hands often, will stop the viruses from spreading in a way . 
 Question:Which of the following sentences is true in the passage ? 
A. An early sign of the cold is viruses in the body. 
B. The virus can't spread through air. 
C. Objects can spread cold viruses, too. 
D. Few colds are "" caught "" by hands.

Context: ""A child is dying---out of breath!"" I had just begun my working day in the city, when these words came through the radio of the police car I was driving. I turned on the red lights and siren and drove off as fast as I could. ""Just my luck!"" I thought. I didn't know this city well and my first call of the day was a life-and-death sudden happening, several kilometers away.
I got to the house. A mother, filled with fear, handed me her baby, his face already blue. Was I too late? Dear me!
I did what had been taught to do in such a serious condition. A small thing flew out of the baby's mouth on to the floor. It was a button. Thank heaven! The holes in it let a little air through.
A doctor rushed into the room. He had with him an oxygen bag.
The child began to cry at the top of his voice, burned red and started to look for his mother. He was angry but was saved.

Context: Everyone gets sick of hearing. ""Put on your seat belt!""But it's good advice. People who wear seat belts are 45 percent less likely to be killed while riding in the front seat of a car.
The US government wants more seat belt laws. It says children aged 4 to 15 are often killed in car accidents. In 2005, there were 1,627 children aged 4 to 15 killed in car accidents. More than 1,000 of those children were not wearing seat belts. If they had been wearing seat belts, 500 of those children could be alive today.
These children are too old to be in car seats, but they often sit in the back seat. Seat belt laws in many states, including Wisconsin, only require people in the front seat to wear seat belts. Children who aren't wearing seat belts can be thrown from the car. The risk of dying in an accident is three times greater if the person is thrown from the car.
New laws could require children aged 4 to 8 to be in booster seats in the car. Booster seats help seat belts fit children properly. Right now, only 5 percent of children aged 4 to 8 are seated in booster seats.
While parents have the choice of whether wearing seat belts or not, children are too young to make that choice. Even if you decide not to wear a seat belt, make sure you children are in seat belts and car seats. It's the law and it will save their lives. 
 Question:More than two-third of 1,627 children were killed because   _  . 
A. they weren't using seat belts 
B. they were too careful when they walked on the road 
C. they were not old enough to sit in the car 
D. they wore seat belts

Context: Many people have never heard of Mesothelioma and are unaware of its symptoms. Although considered a rare form of cancer, each year the number of cases grows. With the prevalence of this disease on the rise, it is critical to understand why and how Mesothelioma develops and what courses of action can be taken in the event of diagnosis. The following is a list of frequently asked questions and answers that will provide you with some information on Mesothelioma, and the legal issues surrounding it.
What is Mesothelioma?
Mesothelioma is the term used to describe a cancerous tumor found in the mesothelial cells of an organ. The organs where this form of cancer is most commonly found are the lungs, heart and abdominal organs. Pleural Mesothelioma is cancer of the lung lining(,)and is the most common form of Mesothelioma.
What causes Mesothelioma?
Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos . Asbestos is often found in building materials used before the mid 1970's. In addition, materials such as pipes, boiler insulation, floor, ceiling and roof tiles may contain asbestos.
How much asbestos exposure will cause Mesothelioma?
Generally, the probability of developing this form of cancer is in accordance with the length of time you are exposed to asbestos. Also, your health is at risk if your exposure to asbestos is intense. It should be noted that Mesothelioma has a latency period of 20 to 50 years. This means that you may develop the disease long after your exposure to asbestos. On average, people tend to develop Mesothelioma somewhere between 35 and 40 years after exposure.
How quickly does Mesothelioma progress?
The onset of Mesothelioma is quite slow. Patients will begin to experience symptoms such as lower back pain and chest pain. These symptoms may also be accompanied by weight loss, fever and difficulty breathing. Unfortunately, once Mesothelioma develops, it quickly becomes aggressive and treatment must be sought immediately.
Can Mesothelioma be treated?
Doctors are able to use several traditional methods of cancer treatment for Mesothelioma, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Like all forms of cancer, detecting the disease at the earliest stage possible greatly increases the patient's chances for survival. If you have worked in an industry such as construction or suspect that you may have been exposed to asbestos, be alert for symptoms and contact your doctor immediately.
What legal courses of action can be taken?
Anyone suffering from Mesothelioma is entitled to compensation from asbestos manufacturers. Additionally, if you are the spouse or child of someone who has died from Mesothelioma, you are entitled to file a claim and seek compensation. 
 Question:Which of the following would be the best title for the text? 
A. Terrible Mesothelioma 
B. Mesothelioma is around us

The respiratory  virus known as SARS has appeared to spread in the United States only to family members of health workers with close contact to a sick person.
On Thursday, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there might be a case of severe acute respiratory syndrome  spreading through the workplace.
Dr. Julie Gerberding said a suspected SARS virus patient who became ill after traveling to Asia might have infected a co-worker in Florida, which made her ""very worried"".
So far, a dozen people--nine family members and three health workers--were infected after coming into close contact with the person with SARS. The rest of the 166 suspected American cases have something to do with people who were infected while traveling in Asia.
In the Gainesville, Fla. area, a 47-year-old woman was believed to have been infected at work by a 60-year-old woman who was the nation's first suspected SARS case, said Tom Belcuore, director of the Alachua County health department.
Since the World Health Organization announced a worldwide warning last month about SARS, the United States has started infection control in hospitals and among families of suspected cases.
Florida officials said a school in Okaloosa County went through a cleaning after a 6-year-old boy suspected of having SARS appeared at school with slight symptoms. ""Health officials are watching the boys' contacts at school to make sure no one else is infected,"" said Rob Hayes, health department spokesman, ""The boy may have been infected from a family member,"" Hayes said, ""We immediately became aware of it and had the child sent home. He's staying at home with his family until 10 days after symptoms disappear.""
The researchers guessed that the virus might have come from animals. However, the scientists have not ruled out the possibility that some other microbe might also help make SARS more serious or easier to catch. 
 Question:How many cases of suspected SARS are there in the U.S.A. according to the text? 
A. 166. 
B. 178. 
C. 12. 
D. 181.

Context: If you were asked what your body is made of, probably you would say that it is made of flesh  and bones and covered with skin. You also know something about the blood which flows through it, and that there is a very important part which we call the brain.
But the flesh and the bones make up the largest part of the body, and there is a good deal to be learned about them. You know the general appearance of both flesh and bone from the parts of animals which you see in the butcher's shop.
Bone is hard, and of a white color; indeed, it looks more like a piece of wood or stone than a part of a living animal. But bone is a real part of the living body, and it grows and is nourished  just as the body is. If a man breaks the bone of his arm or his leg, it is firmly bound up, to prevent the broken parts from moving out of the proper places, and in time then bone grows together again and becomes quite strong.
The bones are fastened together by various kinds of joints . They form the framework of the body, and give it strength to retain its proper shape. This framework is called the skeleton . Some animals, such as worms and slugs, have no skeleton; and others, such as shellfish, have a kind of hard covering or skeleton outside.
The most important part of the skeleton is the backbone. It is so important that naturalists divide all animals into two classes,--- those which have a backbone and those which have none. All the higher animals, including man, have a backbone, or vertebral column as it is called. They are therefore called vertebrate  animals. The others are called invertebrate animals. 
 Question:From the passage, we know higher animals are called  _  . 
A. backbone 
B. human beings 
C. vertebrate animals 
D. skeleton

Context: A Concussion  happens when the brain is shaken, often in a car crash or a fall or a strike on; the head in sports.Concussions can be mild, but doctors may order a CT scan to look for a more serious injury.But a recent study warned that more children than necessary are being exposed  to radiation this way.
A national team led by two doctors at the University of California, Davis, studied hospital records from thousands of children with head injuries. They found that in many cases, the risk of developing cancer from the radiation outweighed the risk of a serious brain injury.
The study found that one in five children over age two had a low risk of serious injury but received CT scans anyway. The same was true of almost one in four children under two years of age.
The researchers have developed rules to predict if a head injury is serious enough for a scan. For children under two, doctors are advised against it if there is:
*Normal mental activity.
*No swelling in the back of the head.
*No feeling of a broken bone in the skull.  
*And no loss of consciousness for more than five seconds.
Doctors should also consider how the child was injured and whether the parents say the child is acting normally.
For patients from two to eighteen, the guidelines are similar ---- except there should be no l vomiting and no severe headache.
Earlier this year, the British Journal of Sports Medicine published new guidelines for concussions in children and teens. International experts said they should not return to sports or school until fully recovered. The brain also needs a ""cognitive rest,"" they say, by restricting activities like video games, texting and watching TV.
It often take longer than adults to recover from a concussion than adults. The experts say individual progress and not a set time period should always guide a decision to return to play. 
 Question:How many aspects should doctors consider when deciding whether a child under two needs a CT scan? 
A. Four. 
B. Six. 
C. Seven. 
D. Nine.

Context: Perhaps it is hard to imagine that a bad tooth could be deadly. But doctors in the Washington area say a twelveyearold boy died last month of a tooth infection that spread to his brain. They say it might have been prevented if the boy had received the dental care he needed.
Experts at the National Institutes of Health say good dental care should start at birth. They say breast milk is the best food for the healthy development of teeth. Breast milk can help slow bacterial growth and acid production in the mouth.
When baby's teeth begin to appear,you can clean them with a wet toothbrush. Dentists say it is important to find soft toothbrushes made especially for babies,and use them very gently.
The use of fluoride   to protect teeth is common in many parts of the world. This natural element is often added to drinking water supplies. The fluoride mixes with enamel ,the hard surface on teeth,to help prevent holes,or cavities from forming.
But the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry points out that young children often swallow toothpaste when they brush their teeth. The group notes that swallowing fluoridated toothpaste can cause problems. So young children should be carefully supervised when they brush their teeth. And only a small amount of fluoridated toothpaste,the size of a green pea,should be used.
Parents often wonder what effects sucking a thumb or sucking on a pacifier might have on their baby's teeth. Dental experts generally agree that this is fine early in life.
The American Academy of Family Physicians says most kids stop sucking their thumbs by the age of four. If it continues,the group advises parents to talk to their child's dentist or doctor. It could influence the correct development of permanent teeth. 
 Question:The boy with a bad tooth died because  _  . 
A. his tooth disease was very deadly 
B. the doctor refused to treat him properly 
C. he didn't receive timely treatment 
D. something was wrong with his brain 
 Answer: C
Context: Most children have ever heard their parents yell ""sit up straight!"" or ""don't hang your head !"" when they eat dinner. Nowadays, it is also heard around another activity -- video games. Ten-year-old Owaish admits it takes him three to four hours a day to play games on his tablet computer. In addition, he plays for about two hours on the smart phone every day. As a result, he started suffering a serious pain in the neck around June or July. What's worse the pain has spread to the hand and back gradually, which makes his mother Mehzabin become concerned.
The doctors note the number of young children with the chronic pain  in their necks, arms and shoulders is on the increase sharp in recent years . They are not aging, they haven't had an accident, the blood reports are fine, their X-rays are fine, and their MRIs are fine. Facts have proved that the pain is from the poor posture  while they are playing video games on smart phones or other electronic devices. 19-year -old student Nida feels pain in the finger which holds the weight of her smart phone most of the day. Nida almost uses her smart phone 24/7, which means 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or all the time.
Health experts predict there will be not only physical but mental  problems resulting from the overuse of electronic devices. They encourage people to often take breaks and exercise from using computers, smart phones or other devices. Stand up! Stretch  the legs, back, shoulders and arms in all the possible directions. That's the most effective way and maybe the key to solving the problem completely. After all, the medication doesn't help sometimes.

Context: We started out in a great morning and were heading over the mountain range to Ellensburg. We stopped at Snoqualmie summit for a quick rest. About a mile from there, we heard a loud sound and thought we might hit a rock. However, we were wrong.
As we were turning into the rest area, we heard a loud banging sound again, and all I could do was get this car pulled over and stopped. Once we got stopped, and tire pulled off, we found that the bolt  ,which is necessary for the brake to work, had been missing. Had I hit the brake with any more speed, I am sure the car would have turned over and we could have all been killed.
The first thing we needed to do was get a new bolt, so my husband went to get a cup of coffee and to ask whether there would be an auto parts store. They told him where, and then he came back to find we had no way to get there. _ One of the coffee volunteers was getting off her shift and offered to take him to the auto parts store. So this angel took him to Ellensburg to get the part, only to find out that it was the wrong part. So she came back to see if everything fit and sure enough, she offered to take him to the hardware store in town to see if they could find this bolt!
She spent well over 4 hours with us, driving us around to help fix our car and protect us until we were safe. She even followed us for a short time on the freeway until she knew we were well on our way safely. We were blessed that day, and when I told her she was an angel she just said we would do the same thing, and she was right, I would and I will again! 
 Question:What actually happened when the writer heard the loud sound at the first time? 
A. The car hit a rock and its tires were broken. 
B. The car pulled over because of the steep road. 
C. The brake couldn't work because of the lost bolt. 
D. The car turned over because the bolt was missing.

Context: A young father was visiting an old neighbor. They were standing in the old man's garden,and talking about children. The young man said,""How strict should parents be with their children?""
The old man pointed to a string between a big strong tree and a thin young one.""Please untie that string,"" he said.The young man untied it,and the young tree bent over to one side. ""Now tie it again,please,"" said the old man,""but first pull the string tight so that the young tree is straight again.""
The young man did so.Then the old man said,""There,it is the same with children.You must be strict with them,but sometimes you must untie the string to know how they are getting on. If they are not yet able to stand alone,you must tie the string tight again.But when you find that they are ready to stand alone,you can take the string away.""

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle?

""It's all right now,"" the dentist told him, ""It's over.""

Context: Two years ago, Wendy Hasnip, 47, experienced a brain injury that left her speechless for two weeks. When she finally recovered, she found herself talking with what seemed to be a French accent: ""I phoned a friend the other day, and she spent the first ten minutes laughing,"" Hasnip said at the time. ""While I have nothing against the French.""
Hasnip suffered from foreign accent syndrome , a rare condition in which people find themselves speaking their own language Like someone from a foreign country. The condition usually occurs in people who have experienced a head injury or a stroke a sudden loss of consciousness, sensation, or movement caused by a blocked or broken blood vessel in the brain.
The condition was first identified during the Second World War in a Norwegian woman whose head was injured during an attack by the German military. The woman recovered but was left with a German-sounding accent, to the horror of fellow villagers who avoided her after that.
Researchers have discovered that the combined effect of the damage to several parts of the brain makes victims lengthen certain syllables, mispronounce sounds, and change,the normal pitch of their voice. Those changes in speech add up to what sounds like a foreign accent.
Another researcher, a phonetician ,says victims of the syndrome don't acquire a true foreign accent. Their strangely changed speech only resembles the foreign: accent with which it has a few sounds in common.
When an English woman named Annie recently developed foreign accent syndrome after a stroke, she spoke with what seemed to be a Scottish accent.
However, Annie's Scottish coworkers said she didn't sound at all like a Scot. 
 Question:If a person suffers foreign accent syndrome  _  . 
A. his coworkers will be afraid of him and avoid contacting with him 
B. he has more chance of suffering stroke again 
C. he will speak a fluent foreign language like native speakers' 
D. his speech only has a few sounds in common with the foreign accent 
 Answer: D
Context: Often speakers at a meeting experience dry mouths and ask for a glass of water.You can solve the problem by activating the saliva in you mouth.First gently bite the edges of your tongue with your teeth.Or,press your entire tongue to the bottom of your mouth and hold it there until the saliva flow.Or you can imagine that you are slicing a big juicy lemon and sucking the juice.
Before you begin your talk,be kind to your voice.Avoid milk or creamy drinks which coat your throat.Keep your throat wet by drinking a little sweetened warm tea or water-down fruit juice.
If you sense that you are losing your voice,stop talking completely.Save your voice for your speech.You may feel foolish using paper to write notes,but the best thing you can do is to rest your voice.If you feel the need to see a doctor,perhaps getting some advice from a professional singer can be a better choice.In the meantime,do not even talk in a low voice.
What about drinking alcohol to wet your throat?I advise you not to touch alcohol before speaking.The problem with alcohol is that one drink gives you a little confidence.The second drink gives you even more confidence.Finally you will feel all-powerful and you will feel you can do everything,but in fact your brain and your mouth do not work together properly.Save the alcohol until after you finish speaking.
Perhaps you want to accept the advice,but you may wonder if you can ever change the habits of a lifetime.Of course you can.Goethe,who lived before indoor skating rinks or swimming pools,said,""We learn to skate in the summer and swim in the winter.""Take this message to heart and give yourself time to develop your new habits.If you are wiling to change,you will soon be able to say that you will never forget these techniques because they've become a part of your body. 
 Question:What is the purpose of the writer to use Goethe's words?

Context: A widow's wish to hear her late husband's voice again has pushed London's Subway system to restore a 40-year-old recording of the subway's famous "" Mind the gap"" announcement.
The underground, or the tube, first opened in 1863, tracked down the voice recording by Oswald Lawrence after his widow, Margaret McCollum, told them what it meant to her.
McCollum, 65, said she used to frequently visit Embankment tube station or plan her journeys around the stop to listen to Lawrence's voice, even before his death. She was _ in November when she noticed it had been replaced by a different voice.
""Lawrence was a drama school graduate when he auditioned   for a tour company. For six years after his death, I'd stay on the platform--just sit and listen to it again,"" she added.
When Margaret approached the tube, she was told it had a new broadcast system and it couldn't use the old recording anymore.
Nigel Holness, director of London Underground, said its staff has been so moved by McCollum's story that they dug up the recording and gave the widow a copy of the announcement on a CD for her to keep. ""Tube staff is also working to restore Lawrence's announcement at the station,"" he added. ""It is celebrating its 150thanniversary this year. The tube's 'Mind the gap' messages, voiced by various actors, have accompanied countless London commuter journeys since the 1960s. Train drivers and staff made the warnings themselves before that.""
""I'm very pleased that people are interested in Oswald's old recording,"" Margaret said. ""He was a great London transport user all his life .He would be amused, touched, and delighted to know he's back where he belonged."" 
 Question:The best title for the passage is  _  .

Context: Ever feel like you've been hit on the head after a bad night's sleep? According to scientists, the thought isn't as unbelievable as it seems.
A study found going without sleep for just one night causes changes in the brain similar to those that occur after a blow to the head. The researchers said the healthy young men examined in the study showed a sudden increase in the same chemicals which indicate brain damage. Professor Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, Sweden, explained that the chemicals NSE and S-100B are biomarkers for brain damage, such as concussion . He said, ""What we found was their levels in the blood rose in the group that went without sleep for a night. This was not to the extent that would happen after a head injury, for instance, but it was still significant. During sleep, the brain cleans poisonous substances off itself.""
Benedict also said previous studies which linked a lack of sleep with increased risk of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis could applaud his study. The rise of the chemicals in the blood after sleep loss may suggest not getting enough sleep contributes to a loss of brain tissue, he explained. Benedict, whose study is published in the journalSleep, added, ""In conclusion, the findings of our experiment indicate a good night's sleep may be critical to maintaining brain health.""
A third of the UK population suffer from sleep-related problems, while the average person now sleeps for only seven hours a night, compared with almost nine a few decades ago. Many scientists believe irregular sleeping patterns lead to illnesses ranging from aches and pains to heart disease, while less than eight hours' sleep a night can lower the IQ the next day. 
 Question:What do we know about previous studies? 
A. They found reasons for brain disorders. 
B. Their findings were published inSleep. 
C. They were supported by Benedict's study. 
D. They focused on brain health.

Context: Getting too little sleep or not spending enough time in rapid eye movement(REM) sleep is connected with being overweight  among children, according to a new study.
   For three nights, researchers studied the sleep patterns of 335 young people, aged 7 to 17. They looked at total sleep time, time spent in REM, time it took to fall asleep. Body-mass index  was checked at the start of the study, and 45 persons in the research were overweight, while 49 were at risk of becoming overweight.
   Compared to normal-weight children, those who were overweight slept about 22 minutes less per night and didn't sleep as well as them, which means shorter REM sleep, less eye activity during REM sleep, and a longer wait before the first REM period.
   After more research, the researchers concluded that one hour less of total sleep was connected a double increased risk of being overweight. One hour less of REM sleep was connected with a three times increased risk.
Although the reasons are still being researched, the relationship between short sleep duration  and overweight may be the result of behavioral and biological changes, which are caused by sleep loss, wrote Dr. Xianchen Liu of the Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic in Pittsburgh and his colleagues.
   They explained that sleep loss causes changes in hormone  levels that may have an effect on hunger, and less sleep also means a person has more waking hours in which to eat. Sleep loss also leads to tiredness the following day, which may lead to less physical activity and fewer calories burned. 
 Question:What is the best title for this passage? 
A. Researchers find why children become overweight. 
B. Kids who are overweight are in need of more sleep. 
C. Children who sleep poorly are at risk of being overweight. 
D. Researchers find ways to prevent children from becoming overweight.

Context: A single night of taking the drug Ecstasy   can cause serious brain damage and speed up the start of Parkinson's disease , scientists say. Just two or three Ecstasy tablets can permanently destroy brain cells that affect movement and reasoning, according to American research that links the drug to Parkinson's for the first time.
A study by a team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, involving squirrel monkeys and baboons   found that both species suffered permanent damage to key cells, which are lost in Parkinson's, after receiving three low doses of Ecstasy at three-hour periods.
The study is particularly important because baboons are one of the best animal models for the human brain. George Ricaurte, who led the research, said that the widespread abuse of drug might have caused severe damage. ""The most troubling result is that young adults using Ecstasy may be increasing their risk of developing Parkinsonism as they get older.""
Alan Leshner, a former director of the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, said, ""This study emphasizes the multi-aspect damage that Ecstasy causes to users. We've long known that repeated use damages brain cells. But this study shows that even very occasional  use can have long-lasting effects on many different brain systems. It sends an important message to young people: don't experiment with your own brain.""
Janet Betts, a mother whose teenage daughter Leah died after a single Ecstasy tablet in 1995, said, ""This comes as no surprise. But people can't see the effects at first, and they say it won't happen to them. We'll see the symptoms later, just as we have with smoking."" 
 Question:The article is intended to   _  . 
A. explain the bad effects of drugs on people's health 
B. warn young people of the risk of taking the drug Ecstasy 
C. persuade people out of such bad habits as smoking and using drugs 
D. tell us the links between the drug Ecstasy and the animal models

Context: In much society, there is often greater acceptance of light skin than dark skin; Light skin may be seen as a mark of beauty, intelligence and success. These beliefs can lead to social pressures even within the same group, if some members are darker than others.
The result is that skin lightening has become very common across Africa, Asia and other areas of the world and more people with dark skin are using skin-lighting products, even if it means they may face health risks. They believe that having whiter skin will improve the quality of their lives. Many people think they will have a better family. Or they want to look like what their society generally considers beautiful.
Some beauty care  products and soaps contain chemicals that make skin lighter. However, some of the chemicals are extremely dangerous. The chemicals in the products block and break down the natural barrier  to protect against sunlight. Then the skin can become thick and discolored. Usually the person will use more of the product in an effort to correct the problem, which just makes things even worse. Doctor Ly says some chemicals are so dangerous that they may lead to blackened fingernails, infections  and serious skin damage.
And these are not the only problems. Experts say some people who change their skin color suffer emotional damage. They feel regretful and sad. They feel that instead of risking their health, they should have learned to live and accept their skin color as it was. 
 Question:Why are chemicals in beauty care products dangerous? 
A. They can damage the skin's color producing progress. 
B. They can control people's emotions and feelings. 
C. They can make the fingernails and skin black. 
D. They make more people decide to change their skin colors. 
 Answer: A
Context: Different colours can affect us in many different ways; that's according to Verity Allen. In a new programme ""Colour me Healthy"", Verity looks at the ways that colours can influence how hard we work and the choices we make. They can even change our emotions and even influence how healthy we are.
""Have you ever noticed how people always use the same colours for the same things?"" says Verity. ""Our toothpaste is always white or blue or maybe red. It's never green. Why not? For some reason we think that blue and white is clean, while we think of green products as being a bit unpleasant. It's the same for businesses. We respect a company which writes its name in blue or black, but we don't respect one that uses pink or orange. People who design new products can use these ideas to influence what we buy.""
During the programme, Verity studies eight different colours, two colours in each part. She meets people who work in the colour industry, from people who design food packages, to people who name the colours of lipsticks. Some of the people she meets clearly have very little scientific knowledge to prove their ideas, such as the American ""Colour Doctor"" who believes that serious diseases can be treated successfully by the use of coloured lights. However, she also interviews real scientists who are studying the effects of green and red lights on mice, with some surprising results.
Overall, it's an interesting show, and anyone who watches it will probably find out something new. But because Verity _ to be polite to everyone she meets on the programme, it's up to you to make your own decisions about how much you should believe. 
 Question:What's the passage mainly about? 
A. How people use colours. 
B. How colours influence people. 
C. What happens in a programme. 
D. What makes a programme believable. 
 Answer: C
Context: In many societies, there is often greater acceptance of light skin than dark skin. Light skin may be seen as a mark of beauty, intelligence and success. These beliefs can lead to social pressure even within the same racial group, if some members are darker skinned than others.
    The result is that skin lightening has become a common activity across Africa, Asia and other areas of the world. More and more people with dark skin are using skin lightening products, even if they may face health risks.
    They believe that having whiter skin will improve their lives. Many people think they will have a better chance of getting a job or marrying into a better family. Or they want to look like what their society generally considers beautiful.
    Some beauty care products and soaps contain chemicals that make skin lighter. This process is also called bleaching. But some of the chemicals are extremely dangerous. One of the most dangerous is hydroquinone.
    Hydroquinone has been banned in several countries. This chemical has been linked to kidney damage and some kinds of cancer. It also causes low birth weight in babies when mothers use it during pregnanc y.
    At first, bleaching products make the skin color1 lighter. But after long-term use they can cause problems. They can even make some skin darker. The chemicals in the products block and break down the natural process that gives color1 to skin. The skin loses its natural barrier to protect against sunlight. Then the skin can become thick and discolor1ed. Usually the person will use more of the product in an effort to correct the problem, but this only makes it worse.
    Fatimata Ly treats skin conditions in the Senegalese capital, Dakar. Doctor Ly says skin bleaching has become a problem throughout Senegal. She says the chemicals are now more dangerous because they are stronger. Some cases have resulted in blackened fingernails, infections and permanent skin damage.
    And these are not the only risks. Experts say some people who change their skin color1 suffer emotional damage. They feel regret and sadness. They feel that instead of risking their health, they should have learned to love and accept their skin color1 as it was. 
 Question:According to the text customers using the bleaching products would also risk  _  . 
A. finger damage 
B. low weight 
C. skin cancer 
D. emotional damage

Context: There are various reasons why cancers appear to be on the increase. For one thing, though their sufferers are to be found in all age groups, cancers are particularly likely to attack persons in their middle and advanced years. Naturally, since people live longer these years, there are more cancer sufferers than before. Again, with better methods of diagnosis  , doctors can more easily recognize cancerous growths that would formerly have passed unnoticed or that would have been wrongly diagnosed. It is also believed that certain habits and conditions of modern living, including heavy smoking and the pollution of the air, may leave people living in more cancer-causing conditions than before.
We all look forward to the day when a simple medical test can find cancer while it is still small. Researchers around the world are working on _ . Most of their work deals with the examination of the blood.
Researchers in Boston have found something in the blood of cancer patients that does not appear in healthy persons. The test showed which persons had cancer and which did not. It was correct more than 90 percent of the time.
The researchers believe the test may be able to show cancer very clearly in its development. Cancers discovered early usually can be treated successfully.
The test examines very small bits of fat in the blood called lipids  . Cancers seem to change lipids although doctors do not know why. The test showed differences between the lipids of the persons with cancer and the lipids of those without cancer.
The researchers say the new test could be a step to develop a simple way to check patients for cancer before the disease shows on an X-ray. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. A simple way to cancer 
B. Cancers can be cured 
C. How to find cancer 
D. Early discovery of cancer

Context: Jack Andraka from Maryland won the grand prize at the 2012 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. It is the largest high school science competition in the world. The Maryland teenager is the youngest winner of the $75,000 prize. He was chosen from among 1,500 students in 70 countries.
Jack Andraka invented a test for pancreatic cancer  . He started to learn it after losing a close family friend to the disease. ""I went on the Internet and I found that 85%of all pancreatic cancers are found late, when someone has less than 2% chance of survival , "" he says, ""and I was thinking,' That's not right. We should be able to do something.'"" He found that early discovery is important to increasing the chances of surviving the disease.
The Maryland teenager asked to work in a laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and was allowed. There he developed a simple paper test, which can recognize the disease in a single drop of blood. His test has proved correct 90% of the time. It also is 100 times more sensitive than other tests. ""It costs 3 cents per test, and then it takes only 5 minutes to run,"" he said.
Jack's success wouldn't have been possible without Anirban Maitra, a professor at Johns Hopkins. He was the only person among the 200 researchers Jack wrote to who showed interest in his project. ""I was very surprised that this was a 15-year-old who was writing this. I wanted to meet this clever young man and see what he wanted to talk about and so I called him over for an interview . ""
Jack worked in Professor Maitra's laboratory, completing his project in 7 months. The government has given the Maryland teenager patent rights to the pancreatic cancer test. He is now talking with companies about developing the test into a simple product.
Whatever happens, the professor believes Jack Andraka's name is one we will be hearing again over the next 10 to 20 years. 
 Question:Jack Andraka's research on pancreatic cancer   _  . 
A. proved to be very successful

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle?

Context: Women are friendly. But men are more competitive. Why? Researchers have found it's all down to the hormone oxytocin . Although known as the love hormone, it affects the sexes differently.
""Women tend to be social in their behavior. They often share with others. But men tend to be competitive. They are trying to improve their social status,"" said Professor Ryan.
Generally, people believe that the hormone exytocin is let out in our body in various social situations and our body creates a large amount of it during positive social interaction such as falling in love or giving birth.
But in a previous experiment Professor Ryan found that the hormone is also let out in our body during negative social interactions such as envy.
Further researches showed that in men the hormone oxytocin improves the ability to recognize competitive relationships, but in women it raises the ability to recognize friendship.
Professor Ryan's recent experiment used 62 men and women aged 20 to 37.
Half of the participants received oxytocin. The other half received placebo . [( )] [( :Love my Dog.)] 
After a week, the two groups switched with participants. They went through the same procedure with the other material.
Following each treatment, they were shown some video pictures with different social interactions. Then they were asked to analyze the relationships by answering some questions. The questions were about telling friendship from competition. And their answers should be based on gestures, body language and facial expressions.
The results indicated that, after treatment with oxytocin, men's ability to correctly recognize competitive relationships improved, but in women it was the ability to correctly recognize friendship that got better.
Professor Ryan thus concluded: ""Our experiment proves that the hormone oxytocin can raise people's abilities to better distinguish different social interactions. And the behavior differences between men and women are caused by biological factor that are mainly hormonal."" 
 Question:Why did Professor Ryan conduct the recent experiment? 
A. To test the effect of oxytocin on the ability to recognize social interactions. 
B. To know the differences between friendship and competition. 
C. To know people's different abilities to answer questions. 
D. To test people's understanding of body language.

Context: Science can't explain the power of pets,but many studies have shown that the company of pets can help lower blood pressure  and raise chances of recovering from a heart attack,reduce loneliness and spread all-round good cheer.
Any owner will tell you how much joy a pet brings.For some.an animal provides more comfort than a husband/wife.A 2002 study by Karen Allen of the State University of New York measured stress 1evels and blood pressure in people-half of them pet owners-while they performed 5 minutes of mental arithmetic or held a hand in ice water.Subjects completed the tasks alone,with a husband/wife,a close friend or with a pet.People with pets did it best.Those tested with their animal friends had smaller change in blood pressure and returned most quickly to baseline heart rates.With pets in the room,people also made fewer math mistakes than when doing in front of other companions.It seems people feel more relaxed around pets,says Allen,who thinks it may be because pets don't judge.
A study reported last fall suggests that having a pet dog not only raises your spirits but may also have an effect on your eating habits.Researchers at Northwestern Memorial Hospital spent a year studying 36 fat people and their equally fat dogs on diet-and-exercise programs;a separate group of 56 people without pets were put on a diet program.On average,people lost about 11 pounds,or 5% of their body weight.Their dogs did even better,losing an average of 12 pounds,more than 15%of their body weight.Dog owners didn't lose any more weight than those without dogs but,say researchers,got more exercise overall-mostly with their dogs--and found it worth doing.

Context: Songs that make our hearts happy can make them stronger too, US researchers reported on Tuesday.
They found that when people listened to their favorite music, their blood vessels    _ in much the same way as when they are laughing, or taking blood medications.
""We have a pretty impressive effect,"" said Dr Michael Miller, director of preventive cardiology   at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore.
""Blood vessel diameter improved,"" he said. ""The vessel opened up pretty significantly. You can see the vessels opening up with other activities such as exercise."" A similar effect is seen with drugs such as statins.
When blood vessels open up more, blood flows more smoothly and is less likely to form the clots   that cause heart attacks and strokes. ""We are not saying to stop your statins or not to exercise but rather to add this to an overall program of heart health,"" said Miller, who presented his findings to a meeting of the American Heart Association in New Orleans.
Miller's team tested 10 healthy, non-smoking men and women, who were told to bring their favorite music. They spent half an hour listening to the recordings and half an hour listening to music they said made them feel anxious while the researchers did ultrasound tests designed to show blood vessel function.
Compared to their normal baseline measurements, blood vessel diameter increased 26 percent on average when the volunteers heard their joyful music. Listening to music they disliked -- in most cases in this group heavy metal -- blood vessels narrowed by six percent, Miller said.
Miller said he came up with the idea after discovering that laughter caused blood to literally flow more smoothly. ""I asked myself what other things make us feel really good, besides calories from dark chocolate of course. Music came to mind. ... It makes me feel really good,"" he said.
Most of the volunteers chose country music but Miller said the style is not so important rather than what pleases each individual. 
 Question:It can be inferred from the passage that   _  . 
A. blood clots are caused by heart attacks and strokes 
B. music is better than chocolate for your health 
C. the style of music has different effects on different people 
D. a person's overall health is more influenced by how much exercise he gets

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle? 
 Answer: A
Context: _ (from How Do Animals Move?)
Many animals scurry up tree trunks to escape enemies or find food. Some live in the treetops. Many of these animals are not only expert climbers, but they also have found interesting ways to get from tree to tree.
   How Do Animals Adapt?andHow Do Animals Move? are comprehensive explorations of animal adaptations and movement for young readers. Both are part of a 21 book series,The Science of Living Things.
   InHow Do Animals Adapt?readers learn how animals adapt to survive with respect not only to climate, darkness, food and defenses but also to offspring and people. These adaptations are well explained in double page spreads   with examples clearly depicted   in photographs and diagrams and developed through their accompanying captions  .
   As the title suggests, movement is the focus ofHow Do Animals Move?Beginning with a description of the explanation of movement, the reader is exposed to the many different ways of animals movement in the air, on land, under ground and in the water. Several unconventional   variations (e.g. looping of inchworms, the rectilinear motion of snakes) are included. Once again, the photographs and diagrams plainly support the double page spread discussions of animal movement.
   The language of both titles is simple enough for young readers without talking down to them. In both books, terminology   is featured in  . Some of these words are explained in the basic glossary while the majority are explained clearly in the text. Many of these terms provide readers with some fascinating, uncommon words (e.g. brachiation, potassium, skein, and estimate). As do many of Kalman's book, both of these titles have a table of contents, glossary and index   which are all enough to introduce young readers to the nature of these tools.
   Both titles would make excellent additions to any science collection for young readers. 
 Question:What do we know about the two books? 
A. They are in high demand. 
B. They are easy to understand. 
C. They have got confusing titles. 
D. They are good choices for novel-readers.

Context: Friedrich Dobl, a Yugoslav working in Germany, was fed up with traffic jams. At long weekends and holiday times when he wanted to get him quickly he always found himself behind hundreds of other cars moving slowly along the notorious foreign workers' route through Germany and Austria.
How easy it all was for police and emergency services. A siren, a flashing light? And like magic everyone was out the way. Going home from work one night he passed a garage. And there in front of him was the answer to his problems. An old ambulance  was for sale. The red cross had been removed. But not the flashing light, and the siren. He tried the light. It flashed magnificently. He tried the siren. That too sounded impressive. He bought the ambulance and opened up for himself a dream world of motoring. It began early in the morning, all his luggage in the back of the ambulance and motorway in Germany looking reasonably clear. Soon, as always, a long line of traffic appeared ahead. He switched on the flashing light and set off the siren. Cars swiftly slowed and pulled off the fast lane. Other cars stopped and drivers waved him ahead to an open road all his own. In record time he crossed the border into Austria. The big bluff was working. Police even waved him through the confusion caused by an accident.
But then the Yugoslav made his big mistake. Until then he had only stopped for petrol. Now he was driving past a real accident, lights flashing , to late realize that it was not another traffic jam as he assumed. They stopped him, and after hearing the story of his ride across two countries fined him 12. 5 pounds.

Context: ""A child is dying---out of breath!"" I had just begun my working day in the city, when these words came through the radio of the police car I was driving. I turned on the red lights and siren and drove off as fast as I could. ""Just my luck!"" I thought. I didn't know this city well and my first call of the day was a life-and-death sudden happening, several kilometers away.
I got to the house. A mother, filled with fear, handed me her baby, his face already blue. Was I too late? Dear me!
I did what had been taught to do in such a serious condition. A small thing flew out of the baby's mouth on to the floor. It was a button. Thank heaven! The holes in it let a little air through.
A doctor rushed into the room. He had with him an oxygen bag.

Context: The story began on a downtown Brooklyn street corner. An elderly man had fallen down while crossing the street , and an ambulance rushed him to the nearest hospital. There, when he came to now and again, the old man repeatedly called for his son.
From a worn letter located in his pocket, an emergency-room   nurse learned that his son was a sailor stationed in North Carolina Camp. Obviously there were no other relatives.
Someone at the hospital called the Red Cross office in Brooklyn, and a request for the son to rush to Brooklyn was sent. Because time was short--the patient was dying, so they found the young man and rushed him to the airport in time to catch the only plane that night enable him to reach his dying father.
It was dusk when the nurse took the tired, anxious sailor to the bedside. ""Your son is here,"" she said to the old man. She had to repeat the words several times before the patient's eyes opened. The medicine he had been given because of the pain from his heart attack made his eyes weak and only saw the young man in uniform( ) standing outside the oxygen tent. He extended his hand. The sailor wrapped his strong fingers around the old man's, releasing a message of love and encouragement. The nurse brought him a chair, so the sailor could sit by the bed.
Nights are long in hospitals, but all through the night the young sailor sat there, holding the old man's hand and offering words of hope and strength. It was nearly dawn when the patient died. The sailor placed his lifeless hand he had been holding on the bed, and went to inform the nurse.
""Who was the man?"" the sailor asked.
""He was your father."" the nurse answered surprisingly.
""No, he wasn't,"" the sailor replied."" I never saw him before in my life.""
""Why didn't you say something when I took you to him?"" she asked.
""I knew immediately there'd been a mistake, but I also knew he needed his son, and his son just wasn't here. When I realized he was too sick to tell whether or not I was his son, I guessed he really needed me. So I stayed.""
Two days later a message came in that there had been two sailors with the same name and similar number in the Camp. Someone in the personnel office had pulled out the wrong record.
But _ And he proved, in a very human way, that there are people who care what happens to their fellow men. 
 Question:The young sailor told the nurse that he was not the real son of the old man  _   . 
A. after the old man died 
B. when the nurse sensed something strange 
C. before the sailor came to the nurse's station 
D. when holding the old man's hand

Context: One Sunday, my family had gathered at my parents' house to feast upon Mom's wonderful cooking. During the normal dinner chatter  , I noticed that my father was slurring   his words. No one mentioned this during dinner, but I felt compelled to discuss it with my mother afterward.
We decided that there was something seriously wrong and that Dad needed to see the doctor.
Mom phoned me two days later. ""The doctor found a brain tumor  . It's too large at this point to operate. Maybe they can do something then, but _ .""
Even with the treatment, my father's condition worsened, and the doctor finally informed us that this condition was terminal  . During one of his stays in the hospital, we brought our baby daughter Chelsey with us when we visited him. By this time he had great difficulty speaking. I finally figured out that he wanted Chelsey to sit on his stomach so he could make faces at her.
Watching the two of them together, I realized I was living an experience that would stay with me forever. Though grateful for the times they could share, I couldn't shake the feeling of a clock ticking in the background.
On the visit to my parents' home during what we all know was my father's last days, my mother took Chelsey from my arms and announced, ""Your father would like to see you alone for a minute.""
I entered the bedroom where my father lay on a rented hospital bed. He appeared even weaker than the day before.
""How are you feeling, Dad?"" I asked. ""Can I do anything for you?""
He tried to speak, but he couldn't make out a word.
""I'm sorry, but I can't understand you,"" I said.
With great difficulty he said, ""I love you.""
We don't learn courage from heroes on the evening news. We learn true courage from watching ordinary people rise above hopeless situations. In many ways my father was a strict, uncommunicative man. He found it difficult to show emotion. The bravest thing I ever saw him do was overcome that barrier to open his heart to his son and family at the end of his life.

A. We don't often value health until we lose it.

Context: There are various reasons why cancers appear to be on the increase. For one thing, though their sufferers are to be found in all age groups, cancers are particularly likely to attack persons in their middle and advanced years. Naturally, since people live longer these years, there are more cancer sufferers than before. Again, with better methods of diagnosis  , doctors can more easily recognize cancerous growths that would formerly have passed unnoticed or that would have been wrongly diagnosed. It is also believed that certain habits and conditions of modern living, including heavy smoking and the pollution of the air, may leave people living in more cancer-causing conditions than before.
We all look forward to the day when a simple medical test can find cancer while it is still small. Researchers around the world are working on _ . Most of their work deals with the examination of the blood.
Researchers in Boston have found something in the blood of cancer patients that does not appear in healthy persons. The test showed which persons had cancer and which did not. It was correct more than 90 percent of the time.
The researchers believe the test may be able to show cancer very clearly in its development. Cancers discovered early usually can be treated successfully.
The test examines very small bits of fat in the blood called lipids  . Cancers seem to change lipids although doctors do not know why. The test showed differences between the lipids of the persons with cancer and the lipids of those without cancer.
The researchers say the new test could be a step to develop a simple way to check patients for cancer before the disease shows on an X-ray. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. A simple way to cancer 
B. Cancers can be cured 
C. How to find cancer 
D. Early discovery of cancer

Context: Many people have never heard of Mesothelioma and are unaware of its symptoms. Although considered a rare form of cancer, each year the number of cases grows. With the prevalence of this disease on the rise, it is critical to understand why and how Mesothelioma develops and what courses of action can be taken in the event of diagnosis. The following is a list of frequently asked questions and answers that will provide you with some information on Mesothelioma, and the legal issues surrounding it.
What is Mesothelioma?
Mesothelioma is the term used to describe a cancerous tumor found in the mesothelial cells of an organ. The organs where this form of cancer is most commonly found are the lungs, heart and abdominal organs. Pleural Mesothelioma is cancer of the lung lining(,)and is the most common form of Mesothelioma.
What causes Mesothelioma?
Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos . Asbestos is often found in building materials used before the mid 1970's. In addition, materials such as pipes, boiler insulation, floor, ceiling and roof tiles may contain asbestos.
How much asbestos exposure will cause Mesothelioma?
Generally, the probability of developing this form of cancer is in accordance with the length of time you are exposed to asbestos. Also, your health is at risk if your exposure to asbestos is intense. It should be noted that Mesothelioma has a latency period of 20 to 50 years. This means that you may develop the disease long after your exposure to asbestos. On average, people tend to develop Mesothelioma somewhere between 35 and 40 years after exposure.
How quickly does Mesothelioma progress?
The onset of Mesothelioma is quite slow. Patients will begin to experience symptoms such as lower back pain and chest pain. These symptoms may also be accompanied by weight loss, fever and difficulty breathing. Unfortunately, once Mesothelioma develops, it quickly becomes aggressive and treatment must be sought immediately.
Can Mesothelioma be treated?
Doctors are able to use several traditional methods of cancer treatment for Mesothelioma, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Like all forms of cancer, detecting the disease at the earliest stage possible greatly increases the patient's chances for survival. If you have worked in an industry such as construction or suspect that you may have been exposed to asbestos, be alert for symptoms and contact your doctor immediately.
What legal courses of action can be taken?
Anyone suffering from Mesothelioma is entitled to compensation from asbestos manufacturers. Additionally, if you are the spouse or child of someone who has died from Mesothelioma, you are entitled to file a claim and seek compensation. 
 Question:We can learn from the text that   _  . 
A. Asbestos is to blame for Mesothelioma. 
B. Even if a person is exposed to asbestos for a while, he will die soon. 
C. All the employees can ask for compensation from asbestos manufacturers. 
D. Mesothelioma is a cancer familiar to many people.

Context: The technology is great. Without it we wouldn't have been able to put a man on the moon, explore the ocean's depths or eat microwave sausages. Computers have revolutionized our lives and they have the power to educate and pass on knowledge. But sometimes this power can create more problems than it solves.
Every doctor has had to try their best to calm down patients who've come into their surgery waving an Internet print-out, convinced that they have some rare incurable disease, say, throat cancer. The truth is usually far more ordinary, though: they don't have throat cancer, and it's just that their throats are swollen. Being a graduate of the Internet ""school"" of medicine does not guarantee accurate self-health-checks.
One day Mrs. Almond came to my hospital after feeling faint at work. While I took her blood sample and tried to find out what was wrong, she said calmly, ""I know what's wrong;I've got throat cancer. I know there's nothing you doctors can do about it and I've just got to wait until the day comes.""
As a matter of routine I ordered a chest X-ray. I looked at it and the blood results an hour later. Something wasn't right. ""Did your local doctor do an X-ray?"" I asked. ""Oh, I haven't been to the doctor for years,"" she replied. ""I read about it on a website and the symptoms fitted, so I knew that's what I had.""
However, some of her symptoms, like the severe cough and weight loss, didn't fit with it--but she'd just ignored this.
I looked at the X-ray again, and more tests confirmed it wasn't the cancer but tuberculosis  --something that most certainly did need treating, and could be deadly. She was lucky we caught it when we did.
Mrs. Almond went pale when I explained she would have to be on treatment for the next six months to ensure that she was fully recovered. It was certainly a lesson for her. "" _ ,"" she said, shaking her head, as I explained that all the people she had come into close contact with would have to be found out and tested. She listed up to about 20, and then I went to my office to type up my notes. Unexpectedly, the computer was not working, so I had to wait until someone from the IT department came to fix it. Typical. Maybe I should have a microwave sausage while I waited? 
 Question:It was lucky for Mrs. Almond   _  . 
A. to have contacted many friends 
B. to have recovered in a short time 
C. to have her assumption confirmed 
D. to have her disease identified in time 
 Answer: D
Context: Alice always wanted to be a singer. Music was the most important thing in her life, but to tell you the truth, she took lessons for years, practiced every day, but in spite of all this, her voice didn't improve. Honestly, it didn't get better, it just got louder.
Her teacher finally gave up and stopped the lessons, but Alice refused to quit  , and one day she decided to give a concert and invited her mere   teacher to attend. 
The teacher was very worried about what to say after the performance. She knew it would be terrible and it was. She didn't want to tell a lie, but she didn't want to hurt Alice's feelings either. Finally, she got an idea and went backstage   to greet her former pupil.

 Question:Why did Alice want to be a singer? 
A. Because she was good at singing. 
B. Because she could do nothing but sing. 
C. Because she had a good teacher. 
D. Because she was most interested in music.

Context: ""I don't think I can do this any more."" ""Yes, you can. You only have five more radiation treatments to go. "" I held my wife Becky close.
Ever since the breast cancer diagnosis  , she had tried hard to be strong for the kids and for me.   When her diagnosis came, my first thought was there was no way I could lose my wife. The doctors assured us the cancer was discovered early so we were feeling positive.
Becky had received an operation and was recovering from it. After six weeks of radiation therapy , she was facing her final five treatments. She was weak and tired, in low spirits. Seeing her suffering, I felt so helpless and powerless.
As soon as I was outside, long-held frustration and anger erupted in me like a volcano. I took a hammer and suddenly was swinging as hard as I could, beating heavily on the front porch . While doing so, I imagined I was beating my wife's cancer. With all my strength, I destroyed the porch.
During the treatment, my wife had been very brave. She said she had it easy, but I don't think it was easy for her.
Seeing the porch gone, Becky shook her head at the window. I came into the room, not knowing how she would react to what I had done.
""Becky, are you mad at me?"" She looked at me in surprise. ""For what?"" I pointed at the gate. ""For tearing down the porch."" She laughed. ""Look how sunny this room is now. I love that it's bright in here.""
""You comforted me in my darker hour, Vince. You've found a way to deal with your own frustration. By destroying the porch, you let the sunshine in.""
As I looked around the brightened room, I realized the light that filled the space was the light of hope that shone so bright after the darkness. We never did re-build the porch. 
 Question:What lesson can we learn from the passage? 
A. Tragedy cannot separate loving couple 
B. A day without sunshine is like night 
C. True love is based on understanding 
D. Nothing is impossible for a willing heart

Context: A Concussion  happens when the brain is shaken, often in a car crash or a fall or a strike on; the head in sports.Concussions can be mild, but doctors may order a CT scan to look for a more serious injury.But a recent study warned that more children than necessary are being exposed  to radiation this way.
A national team led by two doctors at the University of California, Davis, studied hospital records from thousands of children with head injuries. They found that in many cases, the risk of developing cancer from the radiation outweighed the risk of a serious brain injury.
The study found that one in five children over age two had a low risk of serious injury but received CT scans anyway. The same was true of almost one in four children under two years of age.
The researchers have developed rules to predict if a head injury is serious enough for a scan. For children under two, doctors are advised against it if there is:
*Normal mental activity.
*No swelling in the back of the head.
*No feeling of a broken bone in the skull.  
*And no loss of consciousness for more than five seconds.
Doctors should also consider how the child was injured and whether the parents say the child is acting normally.
For patients from two to eighteen, the guidelines are similar ---- except there should be no l vomiting and no severe headache.
Earlier this year, the British Journal of Sports Medicine published new guidelines for concussions in children and teens. International experts said they should not return to sports or school until fully recovered. The brain also needs a ""cognitive rest,"" they say, by restricting activities like video games, texting and watching TV.
It often take longer than adults to recover from a concussion than adults. The experts say individual progress and not a set time period should always guide a decision to return to play. 
 Question:The author of the passage mainly  _  . 
A. describes the risks of brain injuries 
B. suggests CT scans are of practical use 
C. tells us about the risks of brain injury tests 
D. argues against new guidelines for concussions

Context: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog.
Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation.
""The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,"" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery.
The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are ""extremely difficult, if not impossible"" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said.
The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face.
The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants,
Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue.
Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality
There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers.
Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant. 
 Question:The best title for the passage would be   _  . 
A. French Woman has First Partial Face Transplant 
B. First Face Transplant Opens Debate 
C. Risks and Ethical Problems of a Face Transplant 
D. A Complete Face Transplant of a French Woman

Context: Two years ago, Wendy Hasnip, 47, experienced a brain injury that left her speechless for two weeks. When she finally recovered, she found herself talking with what seemed to be a French accent: ""I phoned a friend the other day, and she spent the first ten minutes laughing,"" Hasnip said at the time. ""While I have nothing against the French.""
Hasnip suffered from foreign accent syndrome , a rare condition in which people find themselves speaking their own language Like someone from a foreign country. The condition usually occurs in people who have experienced a head injury or a stroke a sudden loss of consciousness, sensation, or movement caused by a blocked or broken blood vessel in the brain.
The condition was first identified during the Second World War in a Norwegian woman whose head was injured during an attack by the German military. The woman recovered but was left with a German-sounding accent, to the horror of fellow villagers who avoided her after that.
Researchers have discovered that the combined effect of the damage to several parts of the brain makes victims lengthen certain syllables, mispronounce sounds, and change,the normal pitch of their voice. Those changes in speech add up to what sounds like a foreign accent.
Another researcher, a phonetician ,says victims of the syndrome don't acquire a true foreign accent. Their strangely changed speech only resembles the foreign: accent with which it has a few sounds in common.
When an English woman named Annie recently developed foreign accent syndrome after a stroke, she spoke with what seemed to be a Scottish accent.
However, Annie's Scottish coworkers said she didn't sound at all like a Scot. 
 Question:If a person suffers foreign accent syndrome  _  . 
A. his coworkers will be afraid of him and avoid contacting with him 
B. he has more chance of suffering stroke again 
C. he will speak a fluent foreign language like native speakers' 
D. his speech only has a few sounds in common with the foreign accent

Context: Wherever she goes, Molly leaves her mark. Without saying a word, she speaks to people with her kind eyes. Even when she walks away, she leaves an impression.Molly's mark is a smile, stamped into the ground by the horseshoe at the bottom of her false leg.
A few years ago, Molly was badly attacked by a dog.The dog bit all four of Molly's legs and left large cuts in her face. Molly's owner, Kate Harris, took her to an animal hospital.Doctors there were able to save Molly's life, but soon one of her legs became very infected .
At first, doctors thought Molly would have to be put to sleep.But Molly changed their minds. This pony, doctors noticed, shifted her weight, and rested her good leg from time to time. Doctors knew that Molly had amazing intelligence, and that she wanted to live.
Several doctors operated on Molly, and removed her infected leg. A false leg was made for her. The leg was a hollow cast with a pole at the bottom for balance. Doctors gave Molly a special horseshoe at the bottom of the leg. This horseshoe she had had a stamp of a smile face in it!
After the operation, Molly walked around on all four legs, as if nothing had ever happened to her! Now, with every step she takes, she stamps a smile in the dirt.But she leaves her m ark in other ways, too.
Kaye Harris took Molly to the false leg center. There were children there who, like Molly, had artificial arms or legs. They were amazed to see a pony with a false leg. Molly made them smile and gave them hope. Soon, Molly began to visit schools, nursing homes, army bases and hospitals. A book was even written about Molly!

Context: Here is a story told about an American general who was a very important figure in the American army during the First World War. Everybody in the United States knew him and many people wished to have a picture or something of his in their homes.
Soon after the war the general returned to Washington. One day he went to a dentist and had six teeth pulled out. A week later the general heard that his teeth were being sold in curiosity shops as $ 5 each. On each of the teeth there was a label with the name of the general and words: ""Buy these teeth and show them to your friends at home."" The general got angry. He rushed to his office and ordered six officers to go around the city and buy all his teeth.
The officers went out and visited every curiosity shop in the capital. They were away from the office all day. In the evening they returned and put on the table in front of the general the teeth they had bought. They had collected 175 teeth.

Context: For all dinner tables, a glass of milk seems to be a must. At least it was when I was growing up. It is widely believed that milk is a must in building strong bones and teeth. There's no doubt that dairy products, especially milk, are high in protein and calcium, and Vitamin D and Vitamin A are added to most milk products.
While it's well known that our bones need calcium, some studies suggest that high calcium intake doesn't necessarily lower a person's risk for fractures . A Harvard study found that people who drank two or more glasses of milk had no greater protection from breaking a bone than those who drank a glass or less a week.
There is no doubt that we need calcium. Some anti-dairy supporters claim dairy products can lead to heart disease. Much of this claim is based on high-fat dairy products, like cheese and cream, which may indeed lead to some health problems. Some studies have linked high milk intakes with a risk of prostate cancer; this seems also to be caused by high-fat dairy products, but not by dairy products in general.
Although milk has always been regarded as the most important thing we need for our bones, one of the most important things in strengthening bones and reducing the risk of osteoporosis is weight-bearing exercise, such as jogging, walking, and weight lifting.
Perhaps we should think of dairy products as less like a nutrient and more like a food. If you like it, eat it. If not, find something else to eat. Some claims may not be completely true. When I eat cream, I'm not thinking about calcium, protein, or any such thing. I'm thinking it is delicious. 
 Question:Based on the passage, we learn the writer may agree that   _  . 
A. milk is the most important thing that we need for our bones 
B. children should not be permitted to eat cream 
C. milk should be considered more like a food than a nutrient 
D. children should drink milk whether they like it or not

Context: ""Where there is a will, there is a way."" Perhaps not many students can understand this better than 22-year-old Michael Ha. Because of his story of success, he has become an example of young people.
Michael Ha was born in a very poor family. His parents worked in Vietnam before they moved to Britain in 1980. They couldn't find work in Britain because they spoke little English. The whole family had to live on benefits  and they lived in a small house in Hackney, a poor area in East London. Growing up is not easy for Michael, but he never gave up.
At the age of ten, he set his heart on going to Cambridge University. It was not easy, either. Michael studied at a school, which used to be called ""the worst school in Britain"". However, young Michael made his mind to try his best, no matter what kind of school he was studying at. The smart boy studied very hard and did well in every subject at school. Once he made a bet with his friend to learn further math. As a result, after just spending four months teaching himself from a textbook, he got an A in AS-level further math.
Now Michael is the star medical student in John's College, Cambridge and has just won an award for his excellent grades. He hopes he will be an inspiration for other young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Context: When John Weston awoke that morning, he remembered that his mother was going into hospital. He hadn't worked out quite what was wrong with her. He knew, though that she hadn't been well for some time now, and it had become almost familiar to him to see her eyes narrowed in a sudden attack of pain, and her hand pressing against her heart. Their own doctor, who she had finally gone to for advice, had sent her to an expert who knew all about these things. He had told her that just as soon as there was a bed for her, she would have to come into his hospital where he could look after her himself.
During the weeks since then the pains had come even more frequently, and the narrowed eyes became an almost permanent part of her expression. Always rather sharp, she began losing her temper over little things so that John's father kept his thoughts to himself more and more. John, as ready as possible to make allowances, tried to think what it would be like to have toothache all the time and how bad-tempered that would make you.
So his mother would go into hospital for a few days. He was going to stay with his Aunt Daisy till she came back, and his father would stay on at home by himself. John's cousin, Mona, was to come in and make the bed and wash the pots and dust round now and again. That was the arrangement, and John didn't care much for it. Apart from missing his mother(and he was glad she was going away because they would make her better), he wasn't very fond of his Aunt Daisy because she was even more bad-tempered than his mother. 
 Question:how did John react to his mother's bad temper? 
A. he tried to imagine himself in her place. 
B. He tried not to notice it. 
C. He pretended that he had toothache. 
D. He behaved himself as well as possible.

Context: Growing up, I wanted to be just like my mom. She was kind. People always seemed to feel comfortable in her presence. For years, she was a volunteer in our community. I loved going to the local nursing home with her where she taught a ceramic class.
On one summer day, Mama told me to get changed and meet her at the car.
I had planned to spend the day at the lake with friends. Why did she have to ruin everything? I imagined the cool lake water. Irritated, I climbed into the car and slammed the door shut. We sat in silence. I was too upset to make conversation.
""Tasha, would you like to know where we are going?"" Mama asked calmly.
""No,"" I said.
""We are going to volunteer at a children's shelter today. I have been there before and I think it would benefit you,"" she explained.
When we reached the shelter, Mama rang the doorbell. Moments later, we were greeted by a woman. She led us to the front room where all of the children were playing. I noticed a baby whose body was scarred with iron marks. I was told it was because she wouldn't stop crying. The majority of the children had noticeable physical scars. Others hid their emotional wounds.
As I took in my surroundings, I felt a gentle tug on my shirt. I looked down to see a little girl looking up at me. ""Hi. You want to play dolls with me?"" she asked. I looked over at Mama for _ . She smiled and nodded. I turned back and said, ""Sure."" Her tiny hand reached up and held mine, as if to comfort me.
My mom taught me a valuable lesson that summer. I returned to the shelter with her several times. During those visits, some of the children shared their troubled pasts with me and I learned to be grateful for what I had. Today as I strive to instill   these values in my own child, I reflect back to that experience. It was a time that I will never forget.

Context: For all dinner tables, a glass of milk seems to be a must. At least it was when I was growing up. It is widely believed that milk is a must in building strong bones and teeth. There's no doubt that dairy products, especially milk, are high in protein and calcium, and Vitamin D and Vitamin A are added to most milk products.
While it's well known that our bones need calcium, some studies suggest that high calcium intake doesn't necessarily lower a person's risk for fractures . A Harvard study found that people who drank two or more glasses of milk had no greater protection from breaking a bone than those who drank a glass or less a week.
There is no doubt that we need calcium. Some anti-dairy supporters claim dairy products can lead to heart disease. Much of this claim is based on high-fat dairy products, like cheese and cream, which may indeed lead to some health problems. Some studies have linked high milk intakes with a risk of prostate cancer; this seems also to be caused by high-fat dairy products, but not by dairy products in general.
Although milk has always been regarded as the most important thing we need for our bones, one of the most important things in strengthening bones and reducing the risk of osteoporosis is weight-bearing exercise, such as jogging, walking, and weight lifting.
Perhaps we should think of dairy products as less like a nutrient and more like a food. If you like it, eat it. If not, find something else to eat. Some claims may not be completely true. When I eat cream, I'm not thinking about calcium, protein, or any such thing. I'm thinking it is delicious. 
 Question:Based on the passage, we learn the writer may agree that   _  . 
A. milk is the most important thing that we need for our bones 
B. children should not be permitted to eat cream 
C. milk should be considered more like a food than a nutrient 
D. children should drink milk whether they like it or not

Context: While sweet treats can be hard to resist, the World Health Organization(WHO) has set new guidelines for people around the world. The guidelines, released on Wednesday, advise that both adults and children cut back on their sugar intake  to stay healthy.
In a statement, Francesco Branca, director of the WHO's nutrition department, said there is evidence that reducing daily sugar intake reduces the risk of being overweight and tooth decay .
The guidelines do not apply to the sugars in fresh fruit and vegetables or those that are naturally present in milk. According to the WHO, there is no reported evidence of negative effects of consuming those sugars. Instead, the new guidelines focus on ""added"" or ""free"" sugars. These include sugars that are added to processed foods and drinks such as candy and soft drinks.
Added sugars are sometimes described as "" hidden"" sugars because they exist in foods we might not think of as sweets, such as honey and ketchup . Health experts advise that consumers look at ingredients on food packages to help make better-informed decisions.
The WHO recommends that people in the United States, Europe and other Western societies should cut their average sugar intake by about two-thirds, or down to just 10% of their overall calories. For developing countries, where dental care is less advanced, the WHO recommends that sugar intake be reduced to 5%.
Scientist Kieran Clarke, of the University of Oxford, notes that for those people who can't shake their love for sweets, getting more exercise is a good solution. ""If you get enough exercise, you can eat almost anything,"" she said ""But it's very hard to avoid large amounts of sugar unless all you're eating is fruit and vegetables."" 
 Question:We can learn from the text that   _  . 
A. added sugar isn't marked on food packages 
B. we should drink as little milk as possible as it contains sugar 
C. soft drinks don't contain added sugar 
D. the less exercise you do, the fewer sweet things you should eat

Context: Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do.

Context: Darek Fidyka, a 38-year-old Bulgarian, had been paralyzed   from the chest down for four years after a knife attack. Scientists from Britain and Poland took cells from his nose, transplanted   them into his back and re-grew his spinal cord  . Now he can walk and even drive a car. The doctors were delighted but said it was the first step in a long journey.
The breakthrough came after 40 years of research by Professor Geoff Raisman, who found that cells had the possibility to repair damage to nasal   nerves, the only part of the nervous system that constantly re-grows. ""The idea was to take something from an area where the nervous system can repair itself and put it into an area that doesn't repair itself,"" Professor Raisman said.
Polish doctors injected   the nasal cells into Mr Fidyka's spinal cord above the injury and used some nerves from his ankle to form a bridge across the damaged tissue. The nasal cells appear to have caused the spinal nerves to repair themselves.
Professor Raisman achieved this with rats in the late 1990's, but this is his greatest success. ""I think the moment of discovery for me was Christmas in 1997 when I first saw a rat, which couldn't control its hand, put its hand out to me. That was an exciting moment, because I realized then that my belief that the nervous system could be repaired was true.""
Doctors chose the easiest case for their first attempt--it might not work for others. But there is a real sense of hope that an idea once thought impossible has been realized.
David Nicholls, who helped provide money for the breakthrough, said information about the breakthrough would be made available to researchers across the globe.
""What you've got to understand is that for three million paralyzed people in the world today, the world looks a totally brighter place than it did yesterday,"" he said. 
 Question:What made Professor Geoff Raisman begin to believe the nervous system can be repaired? 
A. His former study with other people. 
B. His operation on a paralyzed patient. 
C. His sudden thought about Christmas. 
D. His unusual experience with a sick rat.

Context: Most American children eat potatoes every day, but they don't know which part of potato is most nourishing .Take a sharp knife and cut a very thin slice  from it and hold it to the light, and you will see that the potato has skin, an outside rim  and the inner part. The outside rim which is right under the skin is most nutritious.But this part is often thrown away with the skin. Even the skin itself is better for food than the inside. When eating a cooked potato, if you choose the inside and leave the outside, you are wasting the best part of it. If you can't eat the whole potato, it is better to eat the outside rim and leave the inner part. 
 Question:The best part of the potato is the   _  . 
A. middle 
B. skin 
C. outside rim 
D. inside

Context: Imagine you're in a dark room, running your fingers over a smooth surface in search of a single dot the size of this period, How high do you think the dot must be for your finger to feel it?
Scientists have determined that the human finger is so sensitive it can detect a surface bump just one micron(l0-6m)""high. The human eye, by contrast, can't tell anything much smaller than100 microns.No wonder we rely on touch rather than eyesight when faced with a new roll of toilet paper.
Biologically, touch is the mother of all sensory  systems.It is an ancient sense in evolution: even the simplest single-celled living things can feel when something brushes up against them and will respond by moving closer or pulling away. It is the first sense aroused during a baby's development and the last to weaken at life's peak. Patients in a deep coma  who seem otherwise lost to the world will show skin reaction when touched by a nurse.
""Touch ,is so central to what we are that we almost cannot imagine ourselves without it,"" said Chris Dijkerman.""It's 'not like eyesight, where you close your eyes and you don't see anything. _ .It's always there.""
Long ignored in favor of the sensory heavyweights of eyesight and hearing, the study of touch lately:: has been gaining new concern among scientists.They're exploring the effects of recently reported false touch impressions, of people being made to feel as though they had three arms, for example, with the hope of gaining the true understanding of how the mind works.
Others are turning to touch for more practical purposes: to build better touch screen instruments and robot hands, a more well-rounded virtual life.. ""There's a fair amount of research into new ways of offloading information onto our sense of touch,"" said Lynette Jones. ""To have your cell phone buzzing (making a low sound) as opposed to ringing turned out to have a lot of advantages in.some situations.""
Touch is our most active sense, our means of seizing the world and experiencing it 'first hand. Dr.Susan Lederman pointed out that while we can become aware of something by seeing or hear,ing7;-.from a distance and without really trying, if we want to learn about something by means of touch, we must make a move.We must rub the cloth, or pet the cat. Touching is a two-way street, and that's not true for seeing or hearing. If you have a soft object and you squeeze it, you change its shape. The physical world reacts back.""
Our hands are smart and can do many tasks automatically - button a shirt, fit a key in a lock, play the; piano for others.Dr.Lederman and her colleagues have shown that blindfolded subjects can easily recognize a wide range of common -objects placed.in their hands.But on some feeling tasks, touch is all thumbs (very clumsy). When people are given a raised line drawing of a common object, they're puzzled.""If all we've got is outline information;"" Dr.Lederman said,.""no weight, no texture, no temperature information, well, we're very, very bad with that.""
Touch also turns out to be easy to fool, Among the sensory tricks now being investigated is something called the Pinocchio illusion. Researchers have found that if they shake the band of the biceps , many people report feeling that their forearm is getting 'longer, their hand floating ever further from their elbow . And if they are told to touch the forefinger of the shaken arm to the tip of their nose, they feel as though their nose was lengthening, too. 
 Question:The sense that is firstly awaked during a child's development is the sense of  _  . 
A. sight 
B. taste 
C. hearing 
D. touch 
 Answer: D
Context: If you were asked what your body is made of, probably you would say that it is made of flesh  and bones and covered with skin. You also know something about the blood which flows through it, and that there is a very important part which we call the brain.
But the flesh and the bones make up the largest part of the body, and there is a good deal to be learned about them. You know the general appearance of both flesh and bone from the parts of animals which you see in the butcher's shop.
Bone is hard, and of a white color; indeed, it looks more like a piece of wood or stone than a part of a living animal. But bone is a real part of the living body, and it grows and is nourished  just as the body is. If a man breaks the bone of his arm or his leg, it is firmly bound up, to prevent the broken parts from moving out of the proper places, and in time then bone grows together again and becomes quite strong.
The bones are fastened together by various kinds of joints . They form the framework of the body, and give it strength to retain its proper shape. This framework is called the skeleton . Some animals, such as worms and slugs, have no skeleton; and others, such as shellfish, have a kind of hard covering or skeleton outside.
The most important part of the skeleton is the backbone. It is so important that naturalists divide all animals into two classes,--- those which have a backbone and those which have none. All the higher animals, including man, have a backbone, or vertebral column as it is called. They are therefore called vertebrate  animals. The others are called invertebrate animals. 
 Question:From the passage, we know higher animals are called  _  . 
A. backbone 
B. human beings 
C. vertebrate animals 
D. skeleton

Context: Have you ever had the strange feeling that you were being watched? You turned around and, sure enough, someone was looking right at you!
Parapsychologists   say that humans have a natural ability to sense when someone is looking at them. To research whether such a ""sixth sense"" really exists, Robert Baker, a psychologist at the University of Kentucky, performed two experiments.
In the first one, Baker sat behind unknowing people in public places and stared at the backs of their heads for 5 to 15 minutes. The subjects were eating, drinking, reading, studying, watching TV, or working at a computer. Baker made sure that the people could not tell that he was sitting behind them during those periods. Later, when he questioned the subjects, almost all of them said they had no sense that someone was staring at them.
For the second experiment, Baker told the subjects that they would be stared at from time to time from behind a two way mirror in a laboratory setting. The people had to write down when they felt they were being stared at and when they weren't. Baker found that the subjects were no better at telling when they were stared at and when they weren't. and they were no better at telling when they were stared at than if they had just guessed.
Baker concludes that people do not have the ability to sense when they're being stared at. If people doubt the outcome of his two experiments, said baker, ""I suggest they repeat the experiments and see for themselves."" 
 Question:In the first experiment, the subjects  _  . 
A. were not told that they would be stared at 
B. lost their sense when they were stared at 
C. were not sure when the would be stared at 
D. were uncomfortable when they were stared at

Context: On Thursday October 3, Adam Harper decided to stop drinking coffee. Adam is a MBA student at Harvard University. He studies long hours, gets very little sleep and as a result, he drinks a lot of coffee---anywhere from five to six cups a day. Recently, Adam felt that drinking thus much coffee was making it hard for him to sleep at all. He also began having problems with his concentration , and complained of stomachaches. Adam's doctor made this suggestions: stop drinking coffee altogether.
When Adam got up on October 3, he began his day without his morning coffee. By 11:00 a.m., Adam was in a terrible mood  . He was tired and had a headache. At 11:30, he had a meeting with his student advisor. In the meeting, he found it almost impossible to continue. What was going on?
Caffeine, a chemical found in coffee, was most likely the reason for how Adam felt. Caffeine is a stimulant that boosts  energy levels and improves concentration- but only for a short time. Lowering caffeine consumption  often causes a drop in blood pressure and the result is a ""coffee headache"", People who stop drinking coffee often say they feel tired and moody, and find it hard to focus.
The good news is that these feeling usually pass after four and five days. During this time, doctors suggested taking some aspirin for the headache. So, if Adam can wait, in less than a week, he may be feeling much better. 
 Question:The good news shows that  _  . 
A. Adam will be better if he stops drinking coffee. 
B. More and more people will give up coffee. 
C. Aspirin can stop us thinking coffee 
D. Coffee can never cause headaches.

Context: Read the following interview with Dr John Bass, an international shark  specialist who has spent many years studying sharks:
First of all, doctor, are all sharks dangerous?
  No, they aren't. There are about 250 different kinds of sharks, but fewer than 30 of them are dangerous to humans. Certain sharks are very aggressive   and we should fear them, but the danger of shark attacks is much lower than most people think.
  So which sharks are dangerous?
  The Great White shark is the most dangerous. Then there is the Tiger shark, which other sharks are afraid of, and the Blue shark. Both of them are very fast and dangerous.
  Which are the biggest and smallest sharks?
  The Whale shark is the biggest shark in the world. It grows up to 15 m in length and weighs as much as six large cars. The smallest shark, which is found near prefix = st1 /Japan, could fit into the palm of your hand because it is only 15-20 cm long.
  Do all sharks have teeth ?
  Yes, they do. Most sharks have hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of sharp teeth. These are arranged in rows of four or more. They fit quite loosely in the jaw. When the front ones break off or fall out, spare teeth move forwards from the rows behind: Sharks get a new set of teeth every two weeks. In 10 years, a Tiger may lose as many as 24,000 teeth!
  That's lots of teeth! What kind of food do sharks eat?
  Most sharks feed on small fish, and they keep the oceans healthy by eating sick and injured fish. However, hungry sharks will eat almost anything, including smaller sharks and even rubbish. Inside one Tiger shark which was found, there was a tin can, a bicycle tyre , a leather wallet and an alarm clock!
  And how do sharks find their food, doctor?
  A shark's sense of smell is excellent. It will follow the smell of blood across thousands of metres of ocean. They also see well, and they have good hearing. Sharks can feel movement in water very easily too, and it is possible for them to feel a fish moving as far as 30 m away. 
 Question:Most types of sharks are   _  . 
A. dangerous killers 
B. not dangerous 
C. afraid of people 
D. found inJapan

Context: Here is a story told about an American general who was a very important figure in the American army during the First World War. Everybody in the United States knew him and many people wished to have a picture or something of his in their homes.
Soon after the war the general returned to Washington. One day he went to a dentist and had six teeth pulled out.

Context: If you have a little child , who hates sitting in a child seat, then the FreedomRide is the answer to your problem/
Would you want to be stuck in an unchangeable position every time you're in the car? No. You Wouldn't!
When an adult, sits in a car for any length of time, we stretch, we change the position, we move our legs, and shift constantly. We do this automatically, and without thinking. But kids in a traditional car seat can't do this. They are stuck in one position, and they can't move. We move because the circulation  of blood needs to be restored in our legs as we sit in the same position for any extended length of time.
In a traditional car seat, the child can't move to reduce the pain, so it pts them in a bad mood.
The FreedomRide lets them have a little freedom, and still be safe. The 5-point Harness give them additional safety over a traditional child car seat.
I am the Webmaster for islandbreeze.com, and when JoeySafe asked us to redo their web site, I was attracted by this system. That is because I have two small children, both girls, age 3 and 4 and we obviously, use car seats. I lived in Southern California, and every couple of months, my wife, the girls and I, go to see grandma who lives in Nevada. It's a 5-hour drive, so the FreedomRide works well. Our trips are so much better now, especially, since there is more room in the car without the car seats.
The FreedomRide really did make it easier to go on trips. The only thing you need when you use the Joeysafe instead of your old child seat is a pillow. Besides, mu kids want to take a pillow anyway! As a dad, I feel safe driving with the kids in the FreedomRide. I am a very safety oriented  person. 
 Question:The FreedomRide is likely to be designed for   _  . 
A. a person hating sitting in the car for long 
B. an adult who often drives a traditional car 
C. a child requiring some freedom in the car 
D. a driver whose car has no seats within at all 
 Answer: C
Context: Do you have back pain or difficulty with your eyesight? If you do, you are likely to have a problem of posture, which can be solved if you ask a help from a doctor promptly. The conference on posture held in Rome this year has brought out the fact that an Italian out of four have posture problems. Back pain is certainly the typical disease deriving from a wrong posture, which can also cause other problems: sight problems, for example, which affect above all children.
You might think that women are most affected by these problems, as they are more used to following the trends of fashion, which imposes the use of heavy bags, flat pumps or high-heeled shoes, but the latest conference of the Italian Society of Orthopedics and Traumatology has brought out the fact that men also have bad behavior. About two millions Italian men suffer from backache. Besides wrong shoes and the habits of keeping the wallet in the back pocket for a long time, hi-tech products can cause some serious problems: laptops, iPads, smartphones...all these electronic products together can weigh up to 5 kilos, while the maximum weigh to carry on shoulders should be 3 kilos. The handiness of modern netbooks can have negative consequences, as you can use them when you are lying down. However, it would be better to use them while seated, keeping your back straight and your shoulders relaxed.
If you do not disregard the problem and you intervene in it in time, you can start having a right posture, perhaps doing posture correction exercises and more sport. A global posture re-education , a healthier lifestyle and a series of little devices might solve your back problems. 
 Question:According to the writer the posture problems happen_. 
A. only in Italy 
B. simply in Rome 
C. in the whole world 
D. just in China 
 Answer: C
Context: If you want to stay young, sit down and have a good think. This is the research finding of a team of Japanese doctors, who say that most of our brains are not getting enough exercise--and as a result, we are aging unnecessarily soon.
Professor Taiju Matsuzawa wanted to find out why otherwise healthy farmers in northern Japan appeared to be losing their ability to think and reason at a relatively early age, and how the process of aging could be slowed down.
With a team of colleagues at Tokyo National University, he set about measuring brain volumes of a thousand people of different ages and varying occupations.
Computer technology enabled the researchers to obtain precise measurements of the volume of the front and side sections of the brain, which relate to intellect   and emotion, and determine the human character. (The rear section of the brain, which controls functions like eating and breathing, does not contract with age, and one can continue living without intellectual or emotional faculties.)
Contraction of front and side parts--as cells die off--was observed in some subjects in their thirties, but it was still not evident in some sixty- and seventy-year-olds.
Matsuzawa concluded from his tests that there is a simple remedy to the contraction normally associated with age--using the head.  The findings show in general terms that contraction of the brain begins sooner in people in the country than in the towns. Those least at risk, says Matsuzawa, are lawyers, followed by university professors and doctors. White collar workers doing routine work in government offices are, however, as likely to have shrinking brains as the farm worker, bus driver and shop assistant.    Matsuzawa's findings show that thinking can prevent the brain from shrinking. Blood must circulate properly in the head to supply the fresh oxygen the brain cells need. ""The best way to maintain good blood circulation is through using the brain,"" he says, ""Think hard and engage in conversation. Don't rely on pocket calculators."" 
 Question:According to the passage, which people seem to age slower than the others? 
A. Lawyers. 
B. Farmers. 
C. Clerks. 
D. Shop assistants. 
 Answer: A
Context: While some scientists overlook the existence of a sixth sense for danger, a new research from Washington University in St. Louis has discovered a brain area that clearly acts as an early warning system and helps us adjust our behavior to avoid dangerous situations.
""Our brains are better at picking up not obvious warning signs than we previously thought,"" said Joshua Brown, a PhD in psychology in the issue of the journal Science.
The findings offer exact scientific evidence for a new way to form a concept of the complex control processes taking place in and around the ACC, a brain area located near the top of the frontal lobes  and along the walls that divide the left and right hemispheres .
""In the past, we found activity in the ACC when people had to make a difficult decision, or after they make a mistake,"" Brown said. ""But now we find that this brain area can actually learn to recognize when you might make a mistake, even before a difficult decision has to be made. So the ACC appears to act as an early warning system---- it learns to warn us in advance when our behavior might lead to a negative outcome, so that we can be more careful and avoid making a mistake.""
By providing a clearer picture by which we self monitor and control our behavior, the study is an important step in efforts to develop more effective treatments for mental illnesses. It also provides a new way of understanding inappropriate behaviors that often accompany mental illnesses.
""Our results suggest how injury of the ACC can lead to breakdowns in the early warning system, so that the brain fails to stop or control inappropriate behavior ahead of time,"" said Brown. ""On the other hand, in those persons with mental disorder, the ACC might warn us of an upcoming problem even when no problem is in the existence.""
Known to be an important part of the brain's control system, the ACC is believed to help adjust between cold, hard, fact-based reasoning and emotional responses, such as love, fear or expectation. 
 Question:The new research helps us understand   _  . 
A. why we are likely to make mistakes when the ACC is badly injured 
B. why people with illnesses usually have so many strange behaviors 
C. how the ACC works when something dangerous happens 
D. how our brain warns us of failure in advance

Context: A few years after World II finished, Scientists spoke with great eagerness about the use of nuclear  as source of energy. Within twenty years, they said, nuclear would take the place of coal, gas and oil as a source of power at home and in industry. This promise has never been carried out and there are serious doubts that it ever will be. Nuclear power plants are used to produce energy in some wealthier countries, but the cost is high.
Although safety measures have been taken, radiation leaks  have taken place and workers have been killed or affected. The problem of getting rid of the nuclear waste has proved most difficult. There is a limit to the mount of waste materials which can be buried in the ground or poured in the seabed. These methods may also cause more problems. Waste materials polluted by radiation may remain dangerous for 200 years or more.
It has no surprise that scientists have turned to the sun and the sea as sources of power. The sun shines day after day almost wastefully, providing us with energy far beyond all our earth. 
 Question:Nuclear waste must be dealt with carefully, because  _  . 
A. It still gives off energy 
B. It's much more expensive than coal, gas and oil. 
C. It's harmful to people's health. 
D. It can burn easily.

Context: Lee's mother Sun became unexpectedly pregnant while married to a disabled man. Doctors told her that because of a medication she had been taking her child would not be normal. She chose to continue with the pregnancy and in 1985 in Seoul, South Korea, little Hee Ah Lee was born with only two fingers on each hand, disfigurement of her legs, and slight brain injury. The hospital told Sun that she could not care for the child at home and her relatives wanted her to place the child for adoption in a foreign country. Sun, however, thought her baby would live a successful life.
When Lee was a pre-schooler, Sun wanted her daughter to take piano lessons for two reasons. One was that she felt it would help her strengthen her hands so she could hold a pencil. The other was that she felt that if she could master the piano, she could master anything. For six months piano schools turned them down and then the one teacher who did accept the task got discouraged and wanted to quit. It was a three-month contest of wills between mother and daughter that led to a conflict in which Sun actually threw her daughter on the floor in frustration. But Lee got back up on the piano bench and for the first time played a children's song. That was the turning point and one year later Lee won the grand prize in a piano concert for Kindergartners. It was at the age of 7 that Lee won Korea's 19th National Handicap Conquest Contest and was presented with her award by the President of Korea.
Lee has won numerous awards, and is a widely traveled concert pianist with more than 200 appearances. Her first album titled ""Hee-ah, a Pianist with Four Fingers"" was released in June, 2008.
Lee speaks highly of her mother for challenging her to master the piano and said that although her training was difficult, ""As time went by, the piano became my source of inspiration and my best friend."" 
 Question:When was Lee awarded by the president of Korea? 
A. 1985 
B. 1992 
C. 2008 
D. 2007

Context: Meat and vegetables are measured in grams and kilograms. Milk and other liquid foods are measured in liters or milliliters. These units only measure quantity: they do not measure the value of the food to the body. The unit which measures the quality or value of food is the calorie the amount of heat given off by food when it brurns. This measurement tells how much energy a certain food has when it is completely used by the body.
Our bodies use varying  amount of calories. The more exercise we take, the more calories we burn. If we eat food which contains more calories than we use up, then it is possible that we would increase in weight. In order to avoid becoming overweight, it is advisable to eat a balanced diet and not eat too many foods that have a high calorie rating. The table below gives you some idea of the number of calories in food.

Context: Far from the land of Antarctica, a huge shelf of ice meets the ocean. At the underside of the shelf there lives a small fish, the Antarctic cod.
For forty years scientists have been curious about that fish. How does it live where most fish would freeze to death? It must have some secret. The Antarctic is not a comfortable place to work and research has been slow. Now it seems we have an answer.
Research was begun by cutting holes in the ice and catching the fish. Scientists studied the fish's blood and measured its freezing point.
The fish were taken from seawater that had a temperature of -1.88degC and many tiny pieces of ice floating in it. The blood of the fish did not begin to freeze until its temperature was lowered to -2.05degC. That small difference is enough for the fish to live at the freezing temperature of the ice-salt mixture.
The scientists' next research job was clear: Find out what in the fish's blood kept it from freezing. Their search led to some really strange thing made up of a protein never before seen in the blood of a fish. When _ was removed, the blood froze at seawater temperature. When it was put back, the blood again had its antifreeze quality and a lowered freezing point.
Study showed that it is an unusual kind of protein. It has many small sugar molecules held in special positions within each big protein molecule. Because of its sugar content, it is called a glycoprotein. So it has come to be called the antifreeze fish glycoprotein. Or AFGP. 
 Question:What is the text mainly about? 
A. The terrible conditions in the Antarctic. 
B. A special fish living in freezing waters. 
C. The ice shelf around Antarctica. 
D. Protection of the Antarctic cod. 
 Answer: B
Context: Before fridges, homes usually had ice boxes. But another way to keep food cool without electricity is to use an evaporative   cooler. It is easy to make and does not even use ice.
A common design is a tall box with several shelves inside. The shelves are pieces of metal with many small holes through them. The sides of the box are covered with pieces of thick cloth. Containers of water are placed at the top and bottom of the cooler. The ends of each piece of cloth lie in the water so the cloth stays wet.
Put the cooler in the open air but not in the sun. Air will pass through while the inside of the box will stay several degrees cooler than the outside. This can keep foods fresh for a short time.
The best way to prepare foods for storage   is at harvest time. Place the harvested items on a clean surface, but not on the ground. Fruits and vegetables must be cool from field heat before they are stored. A good idea is to harvest foods either early or late in the day, then leave them to cool naturally. Do not remove outer leaves from fruits and vegetables before storage.
Some fruits and vegetables must be stored at zero to four degrees Celsius. Any colder, and they might be damaged. Others need four to eight degrees, and still others above eight degrees. Cover the items in plastic once they reach the right "" _ "" for storage. 
 Question:What is an evaporative cooler? 
A. An ice box used to contain things. 
B. An electrical container to hold things. 
C. A small box made of cloth to contain food. 
D. A tall box used to cool food without ice or electricity.

In that year Canadian scientist Geoge Kell proved   the English physicist was right. Dr Kell filled one open bowl   with cold water. He filled another with warm water. He put both bowls to the same low temperature. The warm water froze   first.
The lack   of covers on the bowls was the secret  . Some of the warm water changed into vapor.   It evaporated   into the air. This meant that less of the warm water was left to freeze. And so the warm water froze faster than the cold water. 
 Question:Warm vapor can't freeze faster if the bowls are   _  . 
A. full 
B. covered 
C. put outside 
D. changed 
 Answer: B
Context: Every year, World Blood Day is celebrated by blood services worldwide on 14 June, the birthday of Nobel Prize winner Karl Landsteiner, the man who discovered the ABO blood group system. If you have every thought of becoming a blood donor, just register to do it. And you should never worry about the donation.
Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body.
It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients.
First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday.
Although most people are able to give blood, some people who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease are no tasked to be donors. Pregnant women or those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood.
Blood has a very short shelf life. Some blood components can be kept longer than others, for instance red blood cells will keep for 35 days but platelets for only five. Remember, you should wait at least 16 weeks before donating blood again. 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that  _  . 
A. whole blood is most widely used in hospital 
B. platelets can be kept for more than 10 days 
C. people can donate their blood four times a years 
D. people can donate at most 470 ml of blood each time

Context: Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do. 
 Question:Ray Birdwhistell believes that physical appearance   _  . 
A. has little to do with culture 
B. has much to do with culture 
C. is ever changing 
D. is different from place to place

Context: The _ is the tallest modern land animal. It can be over 5. 5 meters tall. Its neck alone may be 1. 9 meters long. Yet the giraffe has only seven bones in its neck, the same number as in the humans'. Even a small bird has many more bones in its neck than a tall giraffe. Each bone in a giraffe's neck is very long, while the bones in a human's neck are short. That makes the difference. A female giraffe gives birth to one baby at a time. The baby, called a calf, is about 1. 9 meters tall at birth. By the age of eight it is full-grown. The giraffe eats mostly leaves. Because it has a long neck, it can reach the high leaves on the trees.

 Answer: D
Context: A previously unknown kind of human group disappeared from the world so completely that it has left behind the merest piece of evidence that it ever existed -- a single bone from the little finger of a child, buried in a cave in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia. 
    Researchers removed DNA from the bone and reported that it differed obviously from that of both modern humans and of Neanderthals , living in Europe until the arrival of modern humans on the continent some 44,000 years ago. 
    The child carrying the DNA line was probably 5 to 7 years old, but it is not yet known if it was a boy or a girl. The finger bone was unearthed in 2008 from a place known as the Denisova cave. 
    Researchers are careful not to call the Denisova child a new human species, though it may prove to be so, because the evidence is initial. 
    But the genetic material removed from the bone, found in a layer laid down on the cave floor between 48,000 and 30,000 years ago, belonged to a distinct human line that traveled out of Africa at a different time from the two known ancient human species. Homo erectus , found in East Asia, left Africa two million years ago, and the ancestor of Neanderthals moved away some 500,000 years ago. The numbers of differences found in the child's DNA indicate that its ancestors left Africa about one million years ago. 
    The region was inhabited by both Neanderthals and modern humans at that time. Counting the new human line, three human species may have lived together. 
The standard view has long been that there were three human resettlements out of Africa -- those of Homo erectus; of the ancestor of Neanderthals; and finally, some 50,000 years ago, of modern humans. But in 2004, archaeologists reported that they had found the bones of small humans who lived on the Indonesian island of Flores until 13,000 years ago, causing a serious problem to this view. The new line is the second such challenge. 
If the nuclear DNA of the Denisova child should differ as much as its mitochondrial  DNA does from that of Neanderthals and modern humans, the case for declaring it a new species would be strengthened. But it would be unusual for a new species to be recognized on the basis of DNA alone. 
In new diggings starting this summer, archaeologists will look for remains more analytical than the finger bone. Researchers will also begin re-examining the fossil collections in museums to see if any wrongly assigned bones might belong instead to the new line.

Context: People who breathe infected air from a TB patient can become infected with the tuberculosis  bacteria . However, most people with active tuberculosis do not expel (,)very many TB bacteria. So, the spread of the disease usually does not happen unless a person spends a large amount of time with a TB patient. Those most at risk are family members, friends and people who live or work closely with a patient.
Tuberculosis can attack any part of the body. However, the lungs are the most common targets  of the bacteria. People with the disease show several signs. They may expel air from the lungs suddenly with an explosive  noise. This kind of cough continues for a long period of time. People with a more severe case of tuberculosis also may cough up blood.
People with the disease often have high body temperatures. They suffer what are called night sweats, during which their bodies release large amounts of water through the skin. TB victims also are tired all the time. They are not interested in eating. So their bodies lose weight.
One thing that is especially dangerous about TB is that people with moderate  signs of the disease may not know they have had it. They may spread the disease to others without even knowing it. So, it is very important for people to get tested for tuberculosis. 
 Question:Why may some TB patients spread the disease to others without even knowing it? 
A. Because there is no sign in the early stage of the disease. 
B. Because these patients don't show any signs of the disease. 
C. Because these patients' signs of the disease are too weak to be noticed. 
D. Because these patients don't know how the disease spreads between people. 
 Answer: C
Context: The World Health Organization recently reported that the number of cases of tuberculosis(TB) has been _ since 2006 . Also, fewer people are dying from TB. But a study by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, says smoking could threaten this progress.
Nearly twenty percent of all people use tobacco, and millions of non-smokers get sick from breathing the smoke. The new study predicts that smoking will produce an additional thirty-four million TB deaths by 2024.
Efforts to control the spread of TB have mainly focused on finding and treating infections. Fewer efforts have been made to understand the causes. Dr Anthony Fauci is the director of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases. He said, ""Despite our control efforts, we still have more than a million people each year dying from TB and millions of people  getting infected; we realize it's still a very important problem. So we have to do the practical thing and we have to do the fundamental research things at the same time. ""
Smoking does not cause TB; bacteria cause the infection. But the study says smoking affects the nervous system in a way that makes an inactive case of TB more likely to develop into an active one. Stanton Glantz is the director of the University of California's Centre for Tobacco Control Research and Education and an author of the new study. He says it shows that TB cannot be controlled unless tobacco use is controlled.  He said, ""It increases the number of people who will get TB by about seven percent.""
The study is described as the first to identify a direct link between tobacco use and rates of TB infection and death. Professor Glantz says the results should guide those creating health policies and TB control efforts. He said, ""If you want to control the infectious disease of TB, you have to control the tobacco industry and the tobacco industry's efforts to increase tobacco use, particularly in developing countries where TB is a big problem."" 
 Question:What would Dr Anthony Fauci probably agree with? 
A. More efforts are needed to find the causes of TB infections. 
B. TB infections are no longer a serious problem. 
C. Few efforts have been put into the work of treating TB infections. 
D. The practical and the fundamental research cannot be done together at present.

Context: There is no excuse for not doing yourassignments . If you can't come to school, you should call your teacher or your classmate and ask about homework. It is yourresponsibility to find out what homework you have missed. It is not the teacher's job to remind you of the missed assignments.
You must not be absent on a test day. If you are seriously ill, call and let the teacher know you will not be there for the test. If your teacher allows amake-up test ,you should take the test within one or two days after you return to class. Serious illness is the only reason for missing a test.
Be on time! It is impolite to be late. Also, it bothers other students. If you must come in late, be sure to do it quietly. Have your books and papers out of your bag before you come into the room. Then go to your seat and sit down quietly. In the USA, it is not necessary to knock before you enter the classroom. Most teachers will give you a low grade if you are often late.
In America, you should call your teacher by his or her last name instead of "" teacher"". Also you should use Mr, Miss, Ms or Mrs before the last name ( such as Mrs Smith or Mr Jones). This is polite. The teacher will tell you the title that he or she likes. It is impolite in the USA to eat, drink or chew gum during class. Don't do these until the break. Also, removing your shoes in the classroom is not polite. 
 Question:What should you do if you miss a class? 
A. Give an excuse for missing the assignments. 
B. Tell the teacher you can't come to school or do the assignments. 
C. Ask your teacher to remind you of the missed assignments. 
D. Call your teacher or your classmate to find out what assignments were given.

Context: The virus ""Ebola"" is named after the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That's where the virus was discovered in 1976. A person can only get Ebola through direct contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, for example, sweat or spit. Additionally, the virus can get into your body through your eyes and mouth if those areas come into contact with something that contains the bodily fluids of an infected person. That's why health care workers are supposed to keep themselves completely covered while treating patients.
The deadliest Ebola outbreak is spreading fast in Western Africa, taking over 900 lives so far. The health systems in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are severely lacking in resources, and health care workers may not have access to adequate protective clothing when working in rural clinics, where the proper protections are lacking. Since Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia share a border; it's easier for people to move from one country to another, increasing the risk for disease spread.
For now, all doctors can do is treat the symptoms and provide supportive care like monitoring heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing while making sure the patients' fluids are supplied. Sometimes patients are given antibiotics  to treat other possible infections. The hope is to make the patient pull through the infection so their immune system can eventually clear the virus. The people who survive Ebola have created enough antibodies to kill it.
There are several promising drugs and vaccines in development, but since Ebola is less common--and research about it is not well funded -- there is no drug or vaccine that has been approved for use in humans. Many of the other drugs and vaccines have not yet been tested in humans. The WHO (World Health Organization) is meeting next week to discuss whether experimental treatments should be used during this outbreak. 
 Question:Why have there been no cures used for Ebola in humans so far? 
A. There are not enough drugs for the infected people. 
B. Ebola is rare and its research money is lacking. 
C. The people have enough antibodies to kill Ebola. 
D. The WHO has decided not to use them.

Context: Bea, a five-year-old girl, was born with a severe illness which means she has to be kept away from other children of her age, because her body is so weak that she would be unable to fight off a common cold.
Bea was diagnosed with this disease when she was five months old. Since then, the hospital has become her second home, medicines for food, and all kinds of treatments her friends. Bea received a very special treatment when she was four years old, which would allow her to be like a normal child if successful. After that, she spent two weeks in ICU before living for four months on a separate ward . Bea was allowed home in February but still needed a special tube in her nose to send in medicines every two days.
Her parents clean the house from top to bottom every two days and hoover each morning to make sure Bea is free from any possible bacteria. Anna, Bea's mother, said, ""she is weak but so strong. We've never seen any child stronger than her. It seems as if nothing in the world could beat her. We really hope to send her to school next year."" She used to drive on the local playground, but Bea was only allowed to watch sitting in the car. ""It was heartbreaking to see Bea staring at the running and laughing children there. She never stopped fighting the disease. I know she's dying for such a normal life.""
Hearing of Bea's story, the Make-A-Wish Foundation has paid for a play park to be built in her back garden. ""Bea is very brave and she has encouraged many children like her,"" said the chairman of the foundation. 
 Question:If Bea stayed with other children freely,_. 
A. other children would have a higher chance to catch her disease 
B. she would catch a common cold which would kill her quickly 
C. her life would be in great danger as she could fall ill easily 
D. she would be lost in playing and forget to receive treatment

Context: My mother fought cancer for almost a decade and died at 56. She held out long enough to meet the first of her grandchildren and to hold him in her arms. But my other children will never have the chance to know her and experience how loving and gracious she was.
We often speak of ""Mommy's mommy,"" and I find myself trying to explain the illness that took her away from us. They have asked if the same could happen to me. I have always told them not to worry, but the truth is that I carry a ""faulty"" gene, BRCA1, which sharply increases my risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian  cancer.
My doctors estimated that I had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman.
Once I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much as I could. I started with the breasts, as my risk of breast cancer is higher than my risk of ovarian cancer, and the surgery is more complex.
On April 27, I finished the three months of medical procedures. During that time I have been able to keep this private and to carry on with my work. But I am writing about it now because I hope that other women can benefit from my experience. Cancer is still a word that strikes fear into people's hearts, producing a deep sense of powerlessness. But today it is possible to find the way out through a blood test whether you are highly susceptible to breast and ovarian cancer, and then take action.
My own process began on February 2. The operation took eight hours. Then I woke up with tubes in my breasts. It did feel like a scene out of a science-fiction film. But days after surgery I can be back to a normal life. There have been many advances in this procedure in the last few years, and the results can be beautiful.
I wanted to write this to tell other women that the decision to have a surgery operation was not easy. But it is one I am very happy that I made. My chances of developing breast cancer have dropped from 87 percent to under 5 percent. I can tell my children that they don't need to fear they will lose me.
It is a comfort that they see nothing that makes them scared. They can see my small scars and that's it. Everything else is just Mommy, the same as she always was. And they know that I love them and I will do anything to be with them as long as I can. On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. 
For any woman reading this, I hope it helps you to know you have options. I want to encourage every woman, especially if you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, to seek out the information and medical experts who can help you through this aspect of your life, and to make your own informed choices.
I acknowledge that there are many wonderful holistic doctors working on alternatives to surgery. My own regimen  will be posted in due course on the Web site of the Pink Lotus Breast Center. I hope that this will be helpful to other women.
I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they can take measures.
Life comes with many challenges. The ones that should not scare us are the ones we can take on and take control of.

Context: Melissa and Roman McCoy were looking forward to the Christmas. But on December 5th, Roman got a phone call that changed everything. Melissa had been in a terrible car accident, and the doctor had little hope she would make it.
""He said the next six to eight hours were critical in determining whether she would live or not. And I just wept,"" Roman said. ""A lot of pressure built up inside, and I just dropped my cell phone on the ground when I heard that. It was the worst feeling that I've ever felt.""
Melissa, a college English professor, was on her way to class when her car hit into a mound of dirt and rolled over several times.
Roman recalled, ""I could only think how I am going to raise my kids without their mother. If she did live, how would I take care of her and my kids? The questions you never want to ask yourself, I had to face.""
Melissa survived the first night. She had injuries to her stomach and lungs and worse, she suffered severe injuries to her brain. She didn't recognize anyone, even her own husband.
""Over the next few days, she remained unresponsive to treatments. The brain surgeon never really gave us much hope.""
Days passed and Melissa didn't improve. Christmas Eve, Roman was by her side in the hospital. Then, he received a Christmas gift he would never forget.
""That evening, she woke up and was just as clear as before, recognized everybody, and was able to read. It was just amazing. I saw her bright smile and her sense of humor. The only way I could describe it is that the weight of the darkness that had hovered over me was just completely gone.""
Melissa quickly improved, and she is back to being a wife, mom, and professor. There is no sign of damage from the brain.
Melissa said, ""I thank him for everything now. It's not just 'thank you for my job, thank you for my children.' It's 'thank you for every aspect of my life.'"" 
 Question:What's the relationship between Melissa and Roman? 
A. Mother and son. 
B. Wife and husband.

Context: The vitamins   are named by letters of the alphabet  . Vitamin A is needed by the eyes. There is Vitamin A in milk, butter, and green vegetables. It can be kept by the body.
Vitamin B cannot be kept. It must be supplied all the time by some of the food we eat.
Vitamin C is very important to the body. Without it men's teeth become loose   and their arms and legs get weak. Lemons  , oranges and tomatoes have Vitamin C in them.
Vitamin D is the sun vitamin. We get it in milk and eggs and from sunlight on our skin  . There are other Vitamins, but these A, B, C and D, are the most important.

Context: Many jobs must be done with two people. One person takes the lead. The other helps. So it is with the human body. Much of our body depends on the cooperation between substances. When they work together, chemical reactions take place smoothly. Body systems are kept in balance.
Some of the most important helpers in the job of good health are the substances we call vitamins. The word ""vitamin"" dates back to Polish scientist Casimir Funk in 1912. He was studying a substance in rice. Funk believed the substance belonged to a group of chemicals known as amines  . He added the Latin word ""vita"", meaning life. So he called the substance a ""vitamine""--an amine necessary for life.
Other studies found that not all vitamins were amines. So the name was shortened to vitamin. But Funk was correct in recognizing their importance.
Scientists have discovered 14 kinds of vitamins. They say vitamins help to carry out chemicals changes within cells. If we do not get enough of the vitamins, we are at risk of developing a number of diseases. _ brings us back to James Lind of Scotland. In the 1740s, Lind was a doctor for the British Navy. He was investigating a problem that had existed in the Navy for many years.
The problem was the disease scurvy . The sailors were weak from bleeding inside their bodies. Even the smallest wound would not heal. Doctor Lind thought the sailors were getting sick because they failed to eat some kinds of foods when they were at sea for many months.
Doctor Lind separated twelve sailors who had scurvy into two groups. He gave each group different foods to eat. One group got oranges and lemons. The other did not. The men who ate the fruit began to improve within seven days. The other men got weaker.
However, which foods should be eaten to keep us healthy? Let us look at some important vitamins for these answers. 
 Question:Why was the name ""vitamine"" shortened to ""vitamin""? 
A. Because Funk was totally wrong. 
B. Because few vitamins were amines. 
C. Because there were new findings. 
D. Because the latter was easy to remember. 
 Answer: C
Context: Sometimes successful health campaigns can have quite unexpected reactions. The years of warnings about skin cancer mean that Britons are happy to cover themselves in sunscreen or stay out of the sun altogether, but it also means that most of us are not getting enough vitamin D.
Scientists announced yesterday that Britons need to increase to three times the amount of vitamin D they get per day. They called on food producers to fortify their products with more of the vitamin and suggested people should consider taking supplements  to keep levels up. They also suggested getting out in the sun for short periods more often, but they warned against ""sun bingeing"".
The government does not publish official advice on the amount of vitamin D people should take due to a lack of research, says Dr Birgit Teucher of the Institute for Food Research. But in the US, the government recommends 5 micrograms a day. By that count, Dr Birgit Teucher said that around 90% of Britons between 19 and 64 would be lacking in the vitamin because they only took around 3 micrograms a day.
Vitamin D is important for absorption of calcium by the body, which is needed for healthy teeth and bones. A lack of it can lead to serious diseases in both children and adults. The vitamin can be found in some foods but it can also be obtained from chemicals in the skin reacting to sunlight. Dr Barbara Boucher said adults should get 5 to 25 micrograms a day. Shortage of vitamin D may be linked to diseases such as muscle weakness, high blood pressure and rickets .
Dr Birgit Teucher gave several reasons for the lack among Britons. Increasing numbers of office-based jobs mean a lack of exposure to the sun; and the rise of becoming overweight means that vitamin D--which is fat soluble is increasingly stored in body fat, where it cannot be accessed readily.
Professor Brian Wharton of the Institute of Child Health said that children in particular needed to have enough vitamin D to prevent rickets.
Professor Graham Bentham, an environmental scientist at the University of East Anglia, added that babies who were only breast-fed probably need to take supplements in case their mother was vitamin D lacking. Those drinking milk were likely to be OK, thanks to the fortification of the drink.
The scientists called on food producers to fortify milk, bread and breakfast nutrient to enable people to get their daily amount of the vitamin. Prof Graham Bentham added that 30 minutes of sun exposure to the face and forearms between April and October would be _ . Outside these months, the sun is not strong enough in Britain for the body to produce its own vitamin D.
But Prof Graham Bentham warned against spending too long in the sun. ""Sun bingeing is well known to be dangerous,"" he said. ""In any case, vitamin D transformation in the skin switches off after a while so short frequent amounts are better for vitamin D formation.""

 Answer: B
Context: According to scientists' research, the month in which babies are born could affect them in some ways.
Babies born in spring get sick easily. Children born under Aquarius may be less clever than those born in other seasons. They may also have shorter lives than those born in autumn  Scientists believe many of the differences can be explained by the mother's exposure to sunlight in pregnancy .  Sunlight helps lead to the production of Vitamin D in the body. The lack of this in the first months of life may have a bad effect on mental and physical health.
Vitamin D, called the ""sunshine vitamin"", is known to help regulate  thousands of genes during development, according to a study of more than two million people. So Vitamin D has a good effect on health  This study showed that people born from April to June had slightly shorter lives than those born in October, November or December. Similar studies in the USA showed that people born in autumn lived about 160 days longer than those born in spring.
Professor Russell Foster, an Oxford University neuroscientist on seasonal biology, said the conclusions were surprising and interesting. He added, ""These are small effects but they are very, very clear. I am not giving voice to star signs and they are just for fun. But it is true that we are affected by our season of birth."" 
 Question:According to the passage,  _   can help people get Vitamin D. 
A. enough sleep 
B. enough sunlight 
C. fresh air 
D. suitable seasons

Context: After years of hearing drivers complain about scratches on their cars, Japan's Nissan Motor Company has officially announced the next big thing---a paint that not only resists scratches and scrapes, but actually repairs itself within a few days.
The new material, developed by Nippon Paint Company, contains an elastic rubbery-like resin  that is able to heal minor marks caused by car wash equipment, parking lot encounters, road debris   or even on-purpose destruction. The automaker admits its results vary depending on the temperature and the depth of the damage, but adds this is the only paint like it in the world, and tests prove it works. Minor scratches, the most common type, are said to slowly fade over about a week. And once they're gone, there is no trace that they were ever there. The special paint is said to last for at least three years after it is first applied, but there is no word yet on whether more can be added after that period.
Nissan claims car washes are the worst offenders for this type of damage, accounting for at least 80 percent of all incidents. But the complete auto-healing won't come without scratching your wallet. The vehicle maker notes the special paint adds about $ 100 U.S. to the price of a car. It plans to use its new chemical mixture only on its X - Trail SUVs in Japan for now, as it looks for a more widespread presentation. And while plans to offer the feature overseas haven't been made yet, if it's a hit there, you can be almost sure market forces will drive it to these shores, as well. 
 Question:The paint used on cars can  _  . 
A. last 3 years before it is re-applied again 
B. fade only in a few days 
C. help to protect cars from minor paint damage 
D. reduce car scrape incidents to 20 percent

Context: A single night of taking the drug Ecstasy   can cause serious brain damage and speed up the start of Parkinson's disease , scientists say. Just two or three Ecstasy tablets can permanently destroy brain cells that affect movement and reasoning, according to American research that links the drug to Parkinson's for the first time.
A study by a team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, involving squirrel monkeys and baboons   found that both species suffered permanent damage to key cells, which are lost in Parkinson's, after receiving three low doses of Ecstasy at three-hour periods.
The study is particularly important because baboons are one of the best animal models for the human brain. George Ricaurte, who led the research, said that the widespread abuse of drug might have caused severe damage. ""The most troubling result is that young adults using Ecstasy may be increasing their risk of developing Parkinsonism as they get older.""
Alan Leshner, a former director of the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, said, ""This study emphasizes the multi-aspect damage that Ecstasy causes to users. We've long known that repeated use damages brain cells. But this study shows that even very occasional  use can have long-lasting effects on many different brain systems. It sends an important message to young people: don't experiment with your own brain.""
Janet Betts, a mother whose teenage daughter Leah died after a single Ecstasy tablet in 1995, said, ""This comes as no surprise. But people can't see the effects at first, and they say it won't happen to them. We'll see the symptoms later, just as we have with smoking."" 
 Question:The article is intended to   _  . 
A. explain the bad effects of drugs on people's health 
B. warn young people of the risk of taking the drug Ecstasy 
C. persuade people out of such bad habits as smoking and using drugs 
D. tell us the links between the drug Ecstasy and the animal models 
 Answer: B
Context: Ever feel like you've been hit on the head after a bad night's sleep? According to scientists, the thought isn't as unbelievable as it seems.
A study found going without sleep for just one night causes changes in the brain similar to those that occur after a blow to the head. The researchers said the healthy young men examined in the study showed a sudden increase in the same chemicals which indicate brain damage. Professor Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, Sweden, explained that the chemicals NSE and S-100B are biomarkers for brain damage, such as concussion . He said, ""What we found was their levels in the blood rose in the group that went without sleep for a night. This was not to the extent that would happen after a head injury, for instance, but it was still significant. During sleep, the brain cleans poisonous substances off itself.""
Benedict also said previous studies which linked a lack of sleep with increased risk of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis could applaud his study. The rise of the chemicals in the blood after sleep loss may suggest not getting enough sleep contributes to a loss of brain tissue, he explained. Benedict, whose study is published in the journalSleep, added, ""In conclusion, the findings of our experiment indicate a good night's sleep may be critical to maintaining brain health.""
A third of the UK population suffer from sleep-related problems, while the average person now sleeps for only seven hours a night, compared with almost nine a few decades ago. Many scientists believe irregular sleeping patterns lead to illnesses ranging from aches and pains to heart disease, while less than eight hours' sleep a night can lower the IQ the next day. 
 Question:What do we know about previous studies? 
A. They found reasons for brain disorders. 
B. Their findings were published inSleep. 
C. They were supported by Benedict's study. 
D. They focused on brain health. 
 Answer: C
Context: Scientists are making new studies of color and its effects on our health. They have known for a long time that the color of a room or the color of the light in it can affect our feelings and emotions. Many prisons and hospitals have at least one room that is painted pink. Officials have found that light and color can produce physical changes in our bodies.
Professor Falfan worked with a group of 9 disabled children at school in Albert. Two of the children were blind. The other seven had normal sight. The scientists changed the color of the school room, then looked for changes in blood pressure, heart beat and breathing rate. The effects of color changes were the same for the blind children as for those with normal sight. Their blood pressure dropped from about 120 to 100. Similar changes were reported in heart-beat and the breathing. The children also were calmer and less excited. Then the colors of the room were returned to orange and white. Blood pressure, heart-beat and breathing rate went up and the children became excited again.
Professor Falfan said different colors produce different levels of light energy. He said the differences seem to affect chemicals in the brain that carry messages from nerve to nerve and from nerve to muscle. 
 Question:The color of pink had a calming effect, that is to say, the color affects   _  . 
A. the chemicals in the brain 
B. the eyes 
C. the skin 
D. the muscle

Context: Good Genes Mean Long Life
Scientists have discovered that living to the age of 100 may have nothing to do with the lifestyle you lead and everything to do with the type of genes you have.
For the lucky carriers of ""Methuselah"" genes, worries over smoking, eating unhealthily and not getting enough exercise may not be as necessary as to those of us without the special gene pattern  .
The ""Methuselah"" genes could give extra protection against the diseases of old age such as cancer and heart disease. They could also protect people against the effects of the unhealthy lifestyles that we believe will lead us to an early death, scientists say. However, the genes are very rare.
The genes include ADIPOQ, which is found in about 10 percent of young people but in nearly 30 percent of people living past 100. They also include the CETP and the ApoC3 genes, which are found in 10 percent of young people, but in about 20 percent of people over 100 years old.
Some of those genes were discovered by a research group at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, led by Professor Nir Barzilai. The team studied the genes of over 500 people over 100 years old, and their children.
The studies show that tiny mutations   in the make-up of some genes can greatly increase a person's lifespan  . Barzilai told a Royal Society conference that the discovery of such genes gave scientists clear targets for developing drugs that could prevent age-related diseases, allow people to live longer and stay healthy.
David Gems, a researcher at University College London, believes that drugs to slow ageing will become widespread.
""If we know which genes control longevity   then we can ... target them with drugs. That makes it possible to slow down ageing,"" he told The Times.
""Much of the pain and suffering in the world are caused by ageing. If we can find a way to reduce that, then we are obliged   to take it.""

Context: Since ancient times, people have known about its ability to reduce pain and high body temperature. More than 2000 years ago, the Greek doctor Hippocrates advised his patients to chew on the bark and leaves of the willow.
The tree contains a chemical called salicin . From salicin, researchers in the 1800s discovered how to make salicylic acid . And in 1897, a chemist named Felix Hoffmann at Friedrich Bayer and Company in Germany created acetyl salicylic acid. Later it became the active substance in a new medicine that Bayer called aspirin. The ""a"" came from acetyl. The ""spir"" came from the spirea plant, which also produces salicin. And the ""in"" Well, that is a common way to end medicine names.
In 1982, a British scientist shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in part for discovering how aspirin works. Sir John Vane found that aspirin blocks the body from making natural substances called prostaglandins .Prostaglandins have several effects on the body. Some cause pain and the expansion, or swelling( ; ), of damaged tissue. Others protect the lining of the stomach and small intestine. Prostaglandins also make the heart, kidneys and blood vessels  work well. But there is a problem. Aspirin works against all prostaglandins, good and bad. Scientists learned how aspirin interferes with an enzyme . One form of this enzyme makes the prostaglandin that causes pain and swelling. Another form of the enzyme creates a protective effect. So aspirin can reduce pain and swelling in damaged tissues. But it can also harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine . 
 Question:What can we know about aspirin according to the passage? 
A. Aspirin can treat almost diseases. 
B. Aspirin can create the protective enzyme. 
C. Aspirin can harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
D. Aspirin can protect the inside of the stomach and small intestine.

 Answer: A
Context: Doctors in hospital emergency rooms often see accidental poisonings . A frightened parent arrives with a child who swallowed a cleaning liquid. Or perhaps the harmful substance is a medicine. Or it might be a chemical product meant to kill insects. These are common causes of accidental poisoning.
In cases like this, look for medical help as soon as possible. Save the container of whatever caused the poisoning. And look on the container for information about anything that stops the effects of the poison. Save anything expelled   from the mouth of the victim. That way, doctors can examine it.
In the past, some people forced poisoning victims to empty the stomach. They used a liquid syrup of ipecac   to do this. But an organization of children's doctors no longer advises parents to keep syrup of ipecac. The American Academy of Pediatrics says some poisons can cause additional damage when they come back up the throat.
Millions of people know a way to save a person who is choking on something trapped in the throat. The method is commonly known as the Heimlich Maneuver or abdominal thrusts. The American Red Cross says a rescuer should first hit the person on the back five times between the shoulder bones. These back blows may ease the choking. If the airway is still blocked, the Red Cross suggests pushing hard five times along the victim's abdomen. The abdomen is the area between the chest and the hip   bones.

Context: People should be warned against using mobile phones outdoors in stormy weather because they may""be struck by lightning"",according to doctors.
Three experts have described how a teenage girl was struck by lightning while using her phone in a large London park.The girl,aged 15,recovered,but a year later was still wheelchair-bound and found to be suffering complex physical and emotional problems.
The girl also had a perforate eardrum on the side where she had been holding the mobile phone.She was having general recovery in Northwick Park Hospital,Middlesex.
Swinda Esprit,a senior house officer, said that while the brain and muscle damage was similar to that of many lightning victims--who can experience heart attacks on being struck--the ear problems were not.
She said that the damages were particularly relevant for people who might be involved in less serious lightning incidents,who might otherwise recover, but would never get their full hearing back if struck while on the phone.
""We were shocked by the damage,which is why we wanted to draw attention to it,""Dr Esprit said.""A year on and she still was suffering these difficult hearing.""
They added that three other cases had been reported in newspapers in China,South Korea,and Malaysia.In the Malaysian case,a sales executive was killed by lightning while talking on his phone during a thunderstorm near Kuala Lumpur.
""All these events resulted in death,""the doctors wrote.""This rare phenomenon is a public health issue,and education is necessary to stress the risk.""
The Australian Lightning Protection Standard recommends that metallic objects,including cordless or mobile phones,should not be carried outdoors during thunderstorms.However, ""the United States National Weather Service says on its website that both are safe to use ""because there is no direct path between you and the lightening"".
Paul Taylor, of ""the Met Office'',said the ear injuries were a consequence of mobile phones being metal,and not related to radio waves.
Mr. Taylor said that mobile phones should be treated as another piece of metal,similar to carrying coins or wearing rings,and people need to be warned against the possible danger. 
 Question:The purpose in writing this passage is  _  . 
A. to draw attention to the risk of using mobile phones in lightening 
B. to focus on various damages done to lightning victims 
C. to tell us the news that a teenage girl was struck by lightning 
D. to stress the danger of making phone calls in lightning

Context: For anyone still doubting the belief that our emotions impact our physical health, a new study from New Zealand should be able to settle the matter. It reports that the physical wounds of healthy seniors healed more quickly if they wrote about their most upsetting experiences.
This confirms the results of a 2010 study, and extends those findings to cover older adults-a group that is likely to suffer wounds (as from surgery), and one with less access to other ways of lowering tension (such as exercise).
Reported in the journal Psychosomatic Medicine, a research team led by the University of Auckland's Elizabeth Broadbent made a study featuring 50 healthy adults ranging in age from 64 to 97. They were assigned to write for 20 minutes per day for three consecutive  days.
Half were asked to write about the most upsetting experience in their life, describing their deepest thoughts, feelings, and emotions about the events, ideally not previously shared with others. The others were asked to write about their daily activities without mentioning emotions, opinions or beliefs.
Two weeks after the third day of writing, all participants received a standard 4mm skin biopsy  on their inner arm. The very tiny wounds caused by the biopsy were photographed regularly over the following days to determine the rate at which they healed.
On the 11th day after the biopsy, the wounds completely healed on 76.2 percent of those who had done the expressive writing. That was true of only 42.1 percent of those who had written about everyday activities.
""The biological and psychological mechanisms   behind this effect remain unclear,"" the researchers wrote, noting that those who had done the expressive writing did not report lower stress levels or fewer depressive symptoms than the others in the control group. Even if they weren't consciously aware of feeling more relaxed or positive, the expressive writing appeared to have caused some sort of bodily reaction-probably involving their immune systems-that hastened their recovery.

Context: French doctors and American scientists have reported doing an operation in which the doctor was outside the operating room. This kind of operation is known as robotic operation.
Doctor Marescaux did the operation in an office in New York City last month, while a sixty-eight-year-old woman patient was in a hospital in Strasbourg, France.
A doctor in Strasbourg got the patient ready. He placed medical tools and a small video camera in her stomach area. Doctor Marescaux in New York watched the patient on a video screen. Then he used the computer to send messages to the robot machine. The robot moved the tools that cut the woman's gallbladder away. The woman got well soon after the operation and left the hospital two days later.
Experts say the main problem with such a robotic operation is based on high-speed telecommunications between the doctor and the robot. Technology must be able to send a doctor's order to a robot to move the tools quickly.
Experts also say a successful robotic operation will improve an operation. For example, the robot can make much smaller movements than a person can. A robot machine can turn tools in ways that a doctor's hand cannot.
Doctors say such a robotic operation will make possible safer and better operations in the future. They say it will improve doctor training. It will also mean that doctors could do an operation on people in dangerous places far away. And it could mean that people could have operations done by top doctors without having to travel to the city where doctors work. 
 Question:If the smaller movement can't be done by doctors in the operation, we may use   _   to solve it. 
A. more tools 
B. a robot machine 
C. a video camera 
D. telecommunications

Context: Japan's All Nippon Airways, which has asked passengers to visit the toilet before boarding to help the environment, said Tuesday it will fit its jets with a women-only lavatory .
ANA will introduce one female-only toilet per aircraft on international flights next month after a survey of women fliers identified  it was the second most attractive service they wished for after being offered desserts. The rest of the toilets onboard will be for men and women as usual.
""We received many comments that having a women-only lavatory would be a factor in differentiating our airline from others,"" said an NAN spokesman.
""Many women said that they feel uncomfortable taking their time in the lavatory knowing that a male is waiting just behind them in line,"" he said. The spokesman denied that the new service was introduced following complaints about men soiling  the bathrooms, telling reporters: ""Those opinions may exist, but we do not have that data on hand"".
Since 2006 ANA has pursued   a one - month awareness campaign each year in which it asks fliers on 38
flights and four international flights to visit the bathroom before boarding to reduce their body weight and therefore cut he plane's carbon-dioxide emissions.
The airline is also planning to install ""washlets"" in it's aircraft-electric toilet seats with water sprays for washing-a common sight in Japan and generally a source of amusement for first-time visitors and users.
The ""washlets"" will be installed in the Boeing777-300ER,due to begin operating in April, and the Boeing 787 fleet set to start flying this year. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the following statement is not true? 
A. Female- only toilet can only be found on international flights. 
B. Women will feel uncomfortable when they know a male is waiting at the toilet door. 
C. The rest of the toilets on international flights will be for men only. 
D. You will be curious about ""washlets"" when you first see it.

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. ""

Context: Every year, World Blood Day is celebrated by blood services worldwide on 14 June, the birthday of Nobel Prize winner Karl Landsteiner, the man who discovered the ABO blood group system. If you have every thought of becoming a blood donor, just register to do it. And you should never worry about the donation.
Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body.
It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients.
First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday.
Although most people are able to give blood, some people who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease are no tasked to be donors. Pregnant women or those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood.
Blood has a very short shelf life. Some blood components can be kept longer than others, for instance red blood cells will keep for 35 days but platelets for only five. Remember, you should wait at least 16 weeks before donating blood again. 
 Question:What component of blood is used to treat burned patients? 
A. Plasma 
B. Red blood cell 
C. Antibody 
D. White blood cell

Context: Many people rely on a cup of coffee or two to wake them up in the morning or pick them up during the working day, but now a chemist has come up with a speedy alternative to crafting a cup of coffee.
U.S. biochemist Ben Yu has created 'Sprayable Energy,' which claims to be the world's first caffeine - based topical energy spray. He said tired workers can spray a 'shot' of caffeine onto their skin without experiencing a strong buzz, loading up on unnecessary calories or being stuck with a nasty aftertaste like they might get from drinking energy drinks or coffee.
The patent-pending caffeine spray is an odourless liquid that is absorbed through the skin and distributed through the body over a number of hours to deliver a caffeine hit that apparently lasts longer than guzzling a cup of coffee.
Each small aluminum bottle of Sprayable Energy contains around 160 sprays - the equivalent amount of caffeine to 40 cups of coffee and the creators say it is a much cheaper way of getting a caffeine fix than popping to a cafe. The only active ingredient in the spray is caffeine, which can naturally enter the human body through the skin by passing through cell membranes as it is very similar to nicotine in structure. Each spritz of Sprayable Energy contains around a quarter of the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee, but apparently has the same effect as a full cup.
The website said: 'The reason for this is our product not being ingested, isn't almost entirely metabolised  by the liver before entering your system and becoming available to your body.''Thus, a smaller amount of caffeine can have just the same effect as a very large amount of caffeine ingested through an energy drink or cup of coffee. Sprayable Energy`s website recommends that users apply the spray in places where they normally spritz perfume, such as the neck or wrists, but warns users not to exceed 20 sprays a day.
It claims that after spraying the product on the skin, users will feel 'awake and focused without being over-stimulated', which is common with coffee and energy drinks. 
 Question:The writer's attitude towards Sprayable Energy   _ 
A. negative. 
B. positive 
C. uncertain 
D. indifferent 
 Answer: B

Context: Geena David knew she wanted to be a movie star when she was very young. She was not sure what gave her the idea, but she wanted to look like a movie star. ""I have a lot of pictures from my childhood of me wearing sunglasses,"" she says. ""I used to wear them to watch TV.""
Early movie actors started wearing sunglasses not because they looked good, but because their eyes hurt. The lights used on movie sets were extremely bright and could cause a painful problem known as ""Klieg eyes"". It was named after the Klieg brothers who invented the lights. Actors wore sunglasses to give their eyes a rest. But when movie stars began wearing their sunglasses in public, they quickly became a must.
Eventually actors started wearing sunglasses in their movies as well as on the street. Audrey Hephburn wore ultra-cool Ray-Ban sunglasses in the 1961 movie, Breakfast at Tiffany's. As a result, Ray-Ban sunglasses started to appear more and more in the movies. In 1979, Ray-Ban ""Wayfarers"" were worn by Jake and Elwood in The Blue Brothers. Tom Cruise wore Ray-Ban ""Aviator"" sunglasses in the 1986 hit, Top Gun. Then in 1997, Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones made Ray-Ban ""Predator"" sunglasses famous in Men in Black.
Of course sunglasses aren't just a fashion statement. The main reason to wear sunglasses is to protect our eyes against UV radiation. UV radiation can damage our eyes, so people now choose their sunglasses carefully. But you don't have to give up style for safety. The choice of frames and lenses available these days is huge. So you can protect your eyes and still be the coolest person on the beach.

Context: If your mother told you to eat carrots so you'd be able to see in the dark, she was right. It turns out that feeding kids carrots is just one of a number of things to keep eyes healthy. Other things include regular eye exams, and sunglasses or hats are also very helpful, experts say.
While eye disease is sometimes hereditary , some are still preventable , said Dr. Ron Weber, an Atlanta-based ophthalmologist. For example, nearsightedness, ""not only has a genetic  component but is also influenced by how kids use their eyes during childhood,"" he told Reuters Health by phone.
He said that extended close work, such as reading, has long been thought to cause nearsightedness. Recent support has come from a study in which people with a higher level of education were more likely to have nearsightedness, because they spend more time reading or working on computers. Another study showed that children who spend more time outdoors are less likely to become nearsighted.
But these findings don't mean kids should be stopped from reading or working on the computer. Instead, Weber suggests, make sure a child's environment is bright enough while they are doing close work. Parents should also help kids get into the habit of holding their reading material at the perfect distance - about 18 to 22 inches, he said. Finally, taking a break every five minutes or so, to let the eyes relax and focus on an object in the distance, will also help.
One of the most important things a parent can do to help _ eye disease and vision problems is to make sure their child gets regular eye exams, beginning early in life. ""The majority of vision problems in children are preventable and treatable,"" said Dr. Ida Chung.

Context: Recently hand-foot-mouth disease has spread across China. In the past three months, there have been about 41,846 cases   in 30 provinces and regions. The number is increasing. Eighteen Chinese children have died of the disease so far this year.
What causes the disease and why is it dangerous?
Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common childhood illness. It mainly affects children under the age of 10. It gets its name from the rash   that develops on the hands and feet. It can also cause blisters   in your mouth.
A child who has the disease will usually have a fever, a runny nose and sore throat. He or she doesn't want to eat or drink because of pain in the mouth.
Hand-foot-mouth disease is mostly not serious. The fever and rash clear within a few days. But in some cases, the virus   affects the heart, lungs or brain. This puts the child's life in danger.
A virus causes hand-foot-mouth disease. The disease spreads easily where a lot of young children are together, such as in a child-care center. Sometimes it can also affect teenagers and adults.
In order not to pass on the virus, good hygiene   is important. We should wash our hands as often as possible. Especially we should wash our hands before meals and after going to the toilet. 
 Question:_   can help us to keep away from the hand-foot-mouth disease.

Only about five people out of a hundred are left-handed.  New-born babies can take hold of things with either of their hands, but in about two years they usually use their right hands.  Scientists don't know why this happens.
Monkeys are our close relatives  in the animal world. Scientists have found that monkeys like to use one of their hands more than the other, but it can be either hand. There are as many right-handed monkeys as left-handed ones. Next time you visit a zoo, watch the monkeys carefully, you will see that some of them will use their right hands and others will use their left hands. But most of the people use their right hands better and this makes life difficult for those left-handed people. We live in a right-handed world. 
 Question:New-born babies can use  _  .. 
A. both of their hands 
B. neither of their hands 
C. their right hands 
D. their left hands

 Answer: C
Context: There are four main areas when it comes to your dog's body language -- his ears and face, eyes, nose and tail. If you pay attention to those things, you'll find you are able to easily understand how your dog is feeling.
Ears and face
The head of a dog is more expressive than you think. If you say a word that he recognizes, like his name or something you say often, his ears will get up. His mouth is another good instruction. A mouth that is wide open to pant   with some sound suggests that the dog is happy -- some people even say when a dog is panting, he is laughing as he cools himself. A tongue sticking out suggests that the dog is in a good mood.
Eyes
To a dog, purple and blue are both seen as shades of blue. Red is seen as black or dark grey. Orange, yellow and green are seen as various shades of yellow. This means that, to a dog, bright orange toys are the same yellow shade. If you want your dog to clearly see his toys in the green grass you'd better give the dog blue toys; if you have orange, yellow or green toys, the dog will be able to find them with his nose.
Nose
A dog can both sniff and breathe through his nose. Breathing is for air, but when dogs sniff with short breaths they are actually following some scents   with his keen   nose. When a dog is overheated, his sense of smell is reduced by as much as 40 percent and he uses the air to cool himself rather than for smelling. Puppies' noses can help find their mother when their eyes and ears are closed. The function will disappear by the time they are adults.
Tail
Lastly, you need to pay attention to your dog's tail, because it shows what he is thinking and feeling. A dog that is in a good mood will have a tail that seems to be going a mile a minute -- wagging, and excited. However, an angry or frightened dog will have his tail between his legs. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE according to the last two parts ""Nose"" and ""Tail""? 
A. Adult dogs can't use their nose to find their mothers. 
B. When a dog feels too hot, he will lose his sense of smell. 
C. Dogs often sniff with short breaths when they feel sad. 
D. A dog's tail can't show his feelings unless he is frightened.

Context: A growing number of college students are applying to take entry tests for medical and dental   schools among increasing graduate unemployment in Korea.
""I've decided to apply for the test to enter a medical college to become a doctor, changing from my original plan to prepare for a lawyer qualification exam in order to get a more stable job in the future,"" said a 24-year-old college graduate, Lee, who majored in business administration during his undergraduate schooling.
The new medical and dental school system is getting popularity, attracting an increasing number of students every year since its appearance in 2004, as it is open to all college graduates regardless of their previous majors.
The Education Development introduced the new medical and dental education system, in which college students with bachelor's degrees are allowed to study medicine or dentistry by taking the Medical Education Test (MET) and Dental Education Test (DET).
Ten medical schools and six dental colleges that have used the new system have received 4,377 applications   for the entrance exams.
Applicants are getting younger compared with those in their 20s representing 76.9 percent of the total. The tests might be easier for students with biology and chemistry majors, but graduates from other majors are also applying for the tests.

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle? 
 Answer: A
Context: Darek Fidyka, a 38-year-old Bulgarian, had been paralyzed   from the chest down for four years after a knife attack. Scientists from Britain and Poland took cells from his nose, transplanted   them into his back and re-grew his spinal cord  . Now he can walk and even drive a car. The doctors were delighted but said it was the first step in a long journey.
The breakthrough came after 40 years of research by Professor Geoff Raisman, who found that cells had the possibility to repair damage to nasal   nerves, the only part of the nervous system that constantly re-grows. ""The idea was to take something from an area where the nervous system can repair itself and put it into an area that doesn't repair itself,"" Professor Raisman said.
Polish doctors injected   the nasal cells into Mr Fidyka's spinal cord above the injury and used some nerves from his ankle to form a bridge across the damaged tissue. The nasal cells appear to have caused the spinal nerves to repair themselves.
Professor Raisman achieved this with rats in the late 1990's, but this is his greatest success. ""I think the moment of discovery for me was Christmas in 1997 when I first saw a rat, which couldn't control its hand, put its hand out to me. That was an exciting moment, because I realized then that my belief that the nervous system could be repaired was true.""
Doctors chose the easiest case for their first attempt--it might not work for others. But there is a real sense of hope that an idea once thought impossible has been realized.
David Nicholls, who helped provide money for the breakthrough, said information about the breakthrough would be made available to researchers across the globe.
""What you've got to understand is that for three million paralyzed people in the world today, the world looks a totally brighter place than it did yesterday,"" he said. 
 Question:What made Professor Geoff Raisman begin to believe the nervous system can be repaired? 
A. His former study with other people. 
B. His operation on a paralyzed patient. 
C. His sudden thought about Christmas. 
D. His unusual experience with a sick rat.

Context: We still don't understand the influence of the mind's power over the body, nor do we understand why there should be such power. All we can say for certain is that the mind does have power over the body in very many different ways.
 If a man is told that he is at the North Pole and he believes what he is told, he'll show physical signs which suggest that his body is reacting as though he were at the North Pole. He'll go pale and shiver. When the film Lawrence of Arabia was shown, cinema managers around the world reported that the sales of ice cream rocketed. The endless desert scenes had made the moviegoers feel uncomfortably hot.
 Hypnotists use the power of the mind over the body in order to use their influence. The hypnotist must only convince the patient that something is true, and the patient will act accordingly. If he convinces the patient that his arms are as heavy as lead, then the patient will be unable to lift his arms. If he convinces the patient that a piece of ice is a hot iron and he then touches the patient's skin with the ice, a blister will develop. The body will react to the suggestion and not to the reality, and signs of a real burn will appear. 
 Question:The phrase ""the reality"" refers to   _  . 
A. a real burn 
B. a hot iron 
C. the touch of ice 
D. the body's reaction 
 Answer: C
Context: Since ancient times, people have known about its ability to reduce pain and high body temperature. More than 2000 years ago, the Greek doctor Hippocrates advised his patients to chew on the bark and leaves of the willow.
The tree contains a chemical called salicin . From salicin, researchers in the 1800s discovered how to make salicylic acid . And in 1897, a chemist named Felix Hoffmann at Friedrich Bayer and Company in Germany created acetyl salicylic acid. Later it became the active substance in a new medicine that Bayer called aspirin. The ""a"" came from acetyl. The ""spir"" came from the spirea plant, which also produces salicin. And the ""in"" Well, that is a common way to end medicine names.
In 1982, a British scientist shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in part for discovering how aspirin works. Sir John Vane found that aspirin blocks the body from making natural substances called prostaglandins .Prostaglandins have several effects on the body. Some cause pain and the expansion, or swelling( ; ), of damaged tissue. Others protect the lining of the stomach and small intestine. Prostaglandins also make the heart, kidneys and blood vessels  work well. But there is a problem. Aspirin works against all prostaglandins, good and bad. Scientists learned how aspirin interferes with an enzyme . One form of this enzyme makes the prostaglandin that causes pain and swelling. Another form of the enzyme creates a protective effect. So aspirin can reduce pain and swelling in damaged tissues. But it can also harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine . 
 Question:What can we know about aspirin according to the passage? 
A. Aspirin can treat almost diseases. 
B. Aspirin can create the protective enzyme. 
C. Aspirin can harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
D. Aspirin can protect the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
 Answer: C

Context: Darek Fidyka, a 38-year-old Bulgarian, had been paralyzed   from the chest down for four years after a knife attack. Scientists from Britain and Poland took cells from his nose, transplanted   them into his back and re-grew his spinal cord  . Now he can walk and even drive a car. The doctors were delighted but said it was the first step in a long journey.
The breakthrough came after 40 years of research by Professor Geoff Raisman, who found that cells had the possibility to repair damage to nasal   nerves, the only part of the nervous system that constantly re-grows. ""The idea was to take something from an area where the nervous system can repair itself and put it into an area that doesn't repair itself,"" Professor Raisman said.
Polish doctors injected   the nasal cells into Mr Fidyka's spinal cord above the injury and used some nerves from his ankle to form a bridge across the damaged tissue. The nasal cells appear to have caused the spinal nerves to repair themselves.
Professor Raisman achieved this with rats in the late 1990's, but this is his greatest success. ""I think the moment of discovery for me was Christmas in 1997 when I first saw a rat, which couldn't control its hand, put its hand out to me. That was an exciting moment, because I realized then that my belief that the nervous system could be repaired was true.""
Doctors chose the easiest case for their first attempt--it might not work for others. But there is a real sense of hope that an idea once thought impossible has been realized.
David Nicholls, who helped provide money for the breakthrough, said information about the breakthrough would be made available to researchers across the globe.
""What you've got to understand is that for three million paralyzed people in the world today, the world looks a totally brighter place than it did yesterday,"" he said. 
 Question:What made Professor Geoff Raisman begin to believe the nervous system can be repaired? 
A. His former study with other people. 
B. His operation on a paralyzed patient. 
C. His sudden thought about Christmas. 
D. His unusual experience with a sick rat.

Context: Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do. 
 Question:Ray Birdwhistell believes that physical appearance   _  . 
A. has little to do with culture 
B. has much to do with culture 
C. is ever changing 
D. is different from place to place 
 Answer: B
Context: When children learn a language, they learn the grammar as well as words or vocabulary. No one teaches them; children just "" _ "".
Before babies begin to produce words, they produce sounds. Some of these sounds will remain if they occur in the language being learned, and others will disappear. This is called the ""babbling stage"".
A child does not learn the language ""all at once"". The child first speaks only one-word ""sentences"". After a few months, the two-word stage arises. During this stage, the child puts two words together. These two-word sentences have definite patterns and express grammatical and meaningful relationships. Still later, in the telegraphic stage, the child will produce longer sentences. These longer sentences are mainly made up of content words. The child's early grammar lacks many of the rules of the adult grammar, but gradually it will become perfect.
All normal children everywhere learn language. This ability is not dependent on race, social class, geography, or even intelligence  . This ability is uniquely   for human. 
 Question:This passage is mainly about   _  . 
A. differences between a child's language and an adult's 
B. ways of teaching babies to talk 
C. children's learning of the mother language 
D. the importance of learning foreign languages

Context: Scientists have recently discovered that mothers tend to hold their baby on the left.Of 255 right-handed mothers,83% held the baby on the left.And out of 32 left-handed women,78%held the baby on the left As a control( ),women were watched coming from supermarkets carrying baby-sized bags;the bags were held with no side preference.
Then,dental   patients were given a large rubber ball to hold during treatment.The majority held the ball to their left side,even when it was interrupted with the dentist's activities.
This suggested that in times of stress objects are held against the left side.
At that point,something clearly contrary was observed.A large number of mothers who brought their premature babies to a clinic were seen to hold their babies against their right side.
So,115 mothers who had been separated from their babies for 24 hours after birth were observed for holding response.The experimenters presented the baby directly to midline of the mother's body, and noted how she held the baby.53% placed the baby on the left and 47% on the right.And it was also noted that the mothers of the group who had held their baby on the left had already had a baby from which they had not been separated after birth.
Left-handed holding enables the baby to hear the heartbeat.In order to discover whether hearing the heart has a beneficial effect on the baby,the sound of a human heart-beat was played to 102 babies in a New York nursery for 4 days.A control group of babies was not exposed to heart-beats.The babies in the heart-beat group gained more weight and cried far less than the babies in the control group. 
 Question:The experiments proved that_. 
A. mothers have an instinct to hold their babies on the left immediately after birth 
B. mothers hold their babies on the left in times of stress 
C. mothers of premature babies do not have the instinct to hold their babies on the left 
D. mothers find it more comfortable to carry their babies on the left because the heart is on that side

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. ""

But this time,something went wrong.Just as he fmished the first few bars ,one of the strings on his violin broke.You could hear it snap ---it went off like gunfire across the room.There was no mistaking what that meant.There was no mistaking what he had to do.
We figured that he would have to get up,put on the clasps again,pick up the crutches and limp his way off stage-to either find another violin or else find another string for this one.But he didn't.Instead.he waited a moment,closed his eyes and then signaled the conductor to begin again.
The orchestra began,and he played from where he had left off.And he played with such passion and such power and such purity as they had never heard before.
When he finished, there was an awesome silence in the room.And then people rose and cheered.He smiled,wiped the sweat from this brow, raised his bow to quit us,and then he said in a quiet tone.""You know, sometimes it is the artist's task to find out how much music you can still make with what you have left.''

We asked Dr Martin Brown, chairman of the department of emergency medicine at Inova Alexandria Hospital in Virginia.
First, the medical term for a cut or tear in the skin is a laceration(,). Dr Brown says the length is usually not as important as the depth. He says a long cut on a finger can likely be treated without a visit to a doctor if the wound is not very deep. ""If you have a short but deep laceration where there's been a structure underneath that's been damaged - a tendon, a nerve, a blood vessel,"" says Martin, ""it may, in fact, need professional attention.""
Some injuries - like a fingertip that gets cut off - might even require surgery to repair. That requires a specialist to either file  down the bone or _ the fingertip. More often, filing down the bone is what is done because reattaching a fingertip is often not successful.
How a wound bleeds can be a sign of how serious it is. Minor cuts usually produce what is known as venous   bleeding. This means the blood flows steadily from the injury. The bleeding will often stop when pressure is put on the wound. Dr Brown says in most cases holding direct pressure with clean gauze or a cloth for four to five minutes should stop the bleeding. With a cut finger, holding the hand above the heart can reduce the loss of blood. But if a cut appears to be pumping blood out with some force, this may be a sign of arterial  bleeding. This kind of injury should be treated by a medical professional as soon as possible.
Even a cut that does not require medical attention must be kept clean to prevent infection. Small cuts should be cleaned gently with clean water. Use a washcloth to clean the area if the wound is dirty. Dr Brown says cuts should be covered with a clean, dry bandage.

Context: We discuss the issue of when to help a patient die. Doctors of our generation are not newcomers to this question. Going back to my internship days, I can remember many patients in pain, sometimes in coma , with late, hopeless cancer. For many of them, we wrote an order for heavy medication--morphine by the clock. This was not talked about openly and little was written about it. It was essential, not controversial.
The best way to bring the problem into focus is to describe two patients whom I cared for. The first, formerly a nurse, had an automobile accident. A few days later her lungs seemed to fill up; her heart developed dangerous rhythm disturbances. So there she was: in coma, on a breathing machine, her heartbeat maintained with an electrical device. One day after rounds, my secretary said the husband and son of the patient wanted to see me. They told me their wife and mother was obviously going to die; she was a nurse and had told her family that she never wanted this kind of terrible death, being maintained by machines. I told them that while I respected their view, there was nothing deadly about her situation. The kidney  failure she had was just the kind for which the artificial kidney was most effective. While possibly a bit reassured, they were disappointed. Here was the head surgeon seemingly determined to keep everybody alive, no matter what.
Within a few days the patient's pacemaker  could be removed and she awoke from her coma. About six months later, the door of my office opened and in walked a gloriously fit woman. After some cheery words of appreciation, the father and son asked to speak to me alone. As soon as the door closed, both men became quite tearful. All that came out was, ""We want you to know how wrong we were.""
The second patient was an 85-year-old lady whose hair caught fire while she was smoking. She arrived with a deep burn; I knew it would surely be deadly. As a remarkable coincidence there was a meeting for discussion going on at the time in medical ethics . The speaker asked me if I had any sort of ethical problem I could bring up for discussion. I described the case and asked the students their opinion. After the discussion, I made a remark that was, when looking back, a serious mistake. I said, ""I'll take the word back to the nurses about her and we will talk about it some more before we decide."" The instructor and the students were shocked: ""You mean this is a real patient?"" The teacher of ethics was not accustomed to being challenged by actuality. In any event, I went back and met with the nurses. A day or two later, when she was making no progress and was suffering terribly, we began to back off treatment. Soon she died quietly and not in pain. As a reasonable physician, you had better move ahead and do what you would want done for you. And don't discuss it with the world first. There is a lesson here for everybody. Assisting people to leave this life requires strong judgment and long experience to avoid its misuse. 
 Question:The author suggested that doctors  _   before they assist a patient in killing himself. 
A. do what they are wanted to do 
B. discuss with the others about the decision first 
C. be required to do so first by the patient 
D. make sure there is no other choice left

Context: People should be warned against using mobile phones outdoors in stormy weather because they may""be struck by lightning"",according to doctors.
Three experts have described how a teenage girl was struck by lightning while using her phone in a large London park.The girl,aged 15,recovered,but a year later was still wheelchair-bound and found to be suffering complex physical and emotional problems.
The girl also had a perforate eardrum on the side where she had been holding the mobile phone.She was having general recovery in Northwick Park Hospital,Middlesex.
Swinda Esprit,a senior house officer, said that while the brain and muscle damage was similar to that of many lightning victims--who can experience heart attacks on being struck--the ear problems were not.
She said that the damages were particularly relevant for people who might be involved in less serious lightning incidents,who might otherwise recover, but would never get their full hearing back if struck while on the phone.
""We were shocked by the damage,which is why we wanted to draw attention to it,""Dr Esprit said.""A year on and she still was suffering these difficult hearing.""
They added that three other cases had been reported in newspapers in China,South Korea,and Malaysia.In the Malaysian case,a sales executive was killed by lightning while talking on his phone during a thunderstorm near Kuala Lumpur.
""All these events resulted in death,""the doctors wrote.""This rare phenomenon is a public health issue,and education is necessary to stress the risk.""
The Australian Lightning Protection Standard recommends that metallic objects,including cordless or mobile phones,should not be carried outdoors during thunderstorms.However, ""the United States National Weather Service says on its website that both are safe to use ""because there is no direct path between you and the lightening"".
Paul Taylor, of ""the Met Office'',said the ear injuries were a consequence of mobile phones being metal,and not related to radio waves.
Mr. Taylor said that mobile phones should be treated as another piece of metal,similar to carrying coins or wearing rings,and people need to be warned against the possible danger. 
 Question:The purpose in writing this passage is  _  . 
A. to draw attention to the risk of using mobile phones in lightening 
B. to focus on various damages done to lightning victims 
C. to tell us the news that a teenage girl was struck by lightning 
D. to stress the danger of making phone calls in lightning

Context: Joanne was stuck in a traffic jam in central Birmingham at 5:30 and at 6:30 she was expected to be chairing a meeting of the tennis club. At last, the traffic was moving. She swung quickly racing to her house. As she opened the door , she nearly tripped over  Sheba.
""Hey, Sheba,"" she said, ""I've got no time for you now, but I'll take you out as soon as I get back from tennis club."" Then she noticed Sheba seemed to be coughing or choking. Obviously, she could hardly breathe. Immediately, Joanne realized she would have to take her to the vet  .
When she got there, the vet was just about to close for the day. Seeing the state of Sheba, Dr. Sterne brought her quickly into his office.
""Listen, doctor, I'm really in a rush to get to a meeting, can I leave her with you, and go and get changed? I'll be back in ten minutes to pick her up, and then I'll take her on to the meeting with me. Is that OK?""
""Sure."" said the doctor.
Joanne made the quick trip back to her house in a couple of minutes. As she was once more entering the hallway, the phone by the door began to ring.
""This is Dr. Sterne,"" said an anxious voice. ""I want you to get out of that house immediately, ""said the doctor's voice. ""I'm coming round right away, and the police will be there any time now. Wait outside!""
At that moment, a police car screeched  to a stop outside the house. Two policemen got out and ran into the house. Joanne was by now completely confused and very frightened. Then the doctor arrived.
""Where's Sheba? Is she OK?"" shouted Joanne.
""She's fine, Joanne. I took out the thing which was choking her, and she's OK now. ""
Just then, the two policemen reappeared from the house, half-carrying a white--faced man, who could hardly walk. There was blood all over him.
""My God, "" said Joanne, ""how did he get in there? And how did you know he was there?""
""I think he must be a burglar."" said the doctor. ""I knew he was there because when I finally removed what was stuck in Sheba's throat:it turned out to be three human fingers."" 
 Question:Joanne wanted to get back to her home again   _   .            . 
A. to dress up for the meeting 
B. to phone the police station 
C. to catch the badly hurt burglar 
D. to wait for her dog to be cured

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle?

Context: Bea, a five-year-old girl, was born with a severe illness which means she has to be kept away from other children of her age, because her body is so weak that she would be unable to fight off a common cold.
Bea was diagnosed with this disease when she was five months old. Since then, the hospital has become her second home, medicines for food, and all kinds of treatments her friends. Bea received a very special treatment when she was four years old, which would allow her to be like a normal child if successful. After that, she spent two weeks in ICU before living for four months on a separate ward . Bea was allowed home in February but still needed a special tube in her nose to send in medicines every two days.
Her parents clean the house from top to bottom every two days and hoover each morning to make sure Bea is free from any possible bacteria. Anna, Bea's mother, said, ""she is weak but so strong. We've never seen any child stronger than her. It seems as if nothing in the world could beat her. We really hope to send her to school next year."" She used to drive on the local playground, but Bea was only allowed to watch sitting in the car. ""It was heartbreaking to see Bea staring at the running and laughing children there. She never stopped fighting the disease. I know she's dying for such a normal life.""
Hearing of Bea's story, the Make-A-Wish Foundation has paid for a play park to be built in her back garden. ""Bea is very brave and she has encouraged many children like her,"" said the chairman of the foundation. 
 Question:If Bea stayed with other children freely,_. 
A. other children would have a higher chance to catch her disease 
B. she would catch a common cold which would kill her quickly 
C. her life would be in great danger as she could fall ill easily 
D. she would be lost in playing and forget to receive treatment

Context: One Sunday, my family had gathered at my parents' house to feast upon Mom's wonderful cooking. During the normal dinner chatter  , I noticed that my father was slurring   his words. No one mentioned this during dinner, but I felt compelled to discuss it with my mother afterward.
We decided that there was something seriously wrong and that Dad needed to see the doctor.
Mom phoned me two days later. ""The doctor found a brain tumor  . It's too large at this point to operate. Maybe they can do something then, but _ .""
Even with the treatment, my father's condition worsened, and the doctor finally informed us that this condition was terminal  . During one of his stays in the hospital, we brought our baby daughter Chelsey with us when we visited him. By this time he had great difficulty speaking. I finally figured out that he wanted Chelsey to sit on his stomach so he could make faces at her.
Watching the two of them together, I realized I was living an experience that would stay with me forever. Though grateful for the times they could share, I couldn't shake the feeling of a clock ticking in the background.
On the visit to my parents' home during what we all know was my father's last days, my mother took Chelsey from my arms and announced, ""Your father would like to see you alone for a minute.""
I entered the bedroom where my father lay on a rented hospital bed. He appeared even weaker than the day before.
""How are you feeling, Dad?"" I asked. ""Can I do anything for you?""
He tried to speak, but he couldn't make out a word.
""I'm sorry, but I can't understand you,"" I said.
With great difficulty he said, ""I love you.""
We don't learn courage from heroes on the evening news. We learn true courage from watching ordinary people rise above hopeless situations. In many ways my father was a strict, uncommunicative man. He found it difficult to show emotion. The bravest thing I ever saw him do was overcome that barrier to open his heart to his son and family at the end of his life.

Context: Quickly ask yourself: What did you eat today? Now tell me how you actually feel. If you're complaining of stress, anxiety, depression, aches and pains, foggy thinking, or just a general lack of energy, a new medical theory will blow your mind. The chances are that those disease-like symptoms are all the result of what's called hidden food allergies .
This is what Ken Drew found out when he was lucky enough to be recommended to medical practitioner Dr. Patel. Patel is considered something of a genius, and has been called a modern day Louis Pasteur. You've heard of him, of course--Pasteur figured out how to keep milk from getting spoiled. Dr. Patel is like a Louis Pasteur for keeping your body from getting spoiled from chronic  diseases.
""Foggy thinking, slightly constipated , heart pain,...you name it. It's part of getting old,"" you say. ""It's just stress."" Most of the body's immune defenses are all located in your stomach, so when you have a hidden food allergy and you expose yourself to harmful foods, your defenses malfunction  and disease-carrying bacteria take over. Had you not eaten that one food you were allergic to for breakfast, you would never have got sick.
Together, Dr Patel and Ken Drew have developed the Reverse My Disease program, which claims it can _ your body against diseases like arthritis , Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease and cancers. You won't need a prescription and there isn't any kind of medical procedure involved. There's no medical jargon, no complicated diet to do. What it does do is claim to tell you how to hack your body's natural defense system.
Dr. Patel has remained under the radar of the entire medical establishment because his ideas are so threatening to doctors who don't want you to stop being sick enough for them to write you prescriptions. Those doctor visits cost you, so check out Reverse My Disease if you want to prevent disease by learning how to eat food that won't harm your body.

Context: Women who own cats are more likely to have mental health problems and kill themselves because they can be infected by a common parasite that can be caught from cat litter, a study has found.
Researchers found women infected with the Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) parasite , which is spread through contact with cat waste or eating undercooked meat or unwashed vegetables, are at increased risk of attempting suicide.
The study involved more than 45,000 women in Denmark. About a third of the world's population is infected with the parasite, which hides in cells in the brain and muscles, often without producing symptoms.
The infection, which is called toxoplasmosis , has been linked to mental illness, such as schizophrenia , and changes in behavior.
The study's senior author Doctor Teodor Postolache, an associate professor of psychiatry  at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in the United States, said, ""We can't say with certainty that T. gondii caused the women to try to kill themselves, but we did find a predictive association between the infection and suicide attempts later in life that deserves additional studies.""
Doctor Albert Reece, vice president of medical affairs at the University of Maryland, said, ""T. gondii infection is a major public health problem around the world, and many people don't realize they're infected.
""Dr Postolache is a leading expert on suicide neuroimmunology . Suicide is a critically important mental health issue. About one million people commit suicide and another 10 million attempt suicide worldwide each year. We hope that this type of research will one day help us find ways to save many lives that now end too early in suicide.""
Dr. Postolache's research team at the University of Maryland was the first to report a connection between T. gondii and suicidal behavior in 2009. He is cooperating with researchers in Denmark, Germany and Sweden to confirm and investigate the way leading to this association.
The T. gondii parasite thrives in the intestines of cats, and it is spread through their waste. All warm-blooded animals can become infected through contact with it. Humans can become infected by changing their infected cats' litter boxes, eating unwashed vegetables, drinking water from a polluted source, or by eating undercooked or raw meat.
Not washing kitchen knives after preparing raw meat before handling another food item also can lead to infection. Pregnant women can pass the parasite directly to their unborn babies and are advised not to change cat litter boxes to avoid possible infection.
Babies don't produce antibodies to T. gondii for three months after they are born, so the antibodies present in their blood represented infection in the mothers. The scientists studied Danish health patients to determine if any of these women later attempted suicide, including cases of violent suicide attempts which may have involved guns, sharp instruments and jumping from high places.
The study found that women infected with T. gondii were one and a half times more likely to attempt suicide compared to those who were not infected, and the risk seemed to rise with increasing levels of the T. gondii antibodies.
Dr Postolache noted limitations to the study, such as the inability to determine the cause of the suicidal behavior.
The findings were published online in the Archives of General Psychiatry. 
 Question:What is the consequence if a woman is infected with the parasite in the passage? 
A. Having a high fever. 
B. Doing deliberate self-harm. 
C. Keeping a depressed mood. 
D. Becoming bad tempered.

Not washing kitchen knives after preparing raw meat before handling another food item also can lead to infection. Pregnant women can pass the parasite directly to their unborn babies and are advised not to change cat litter boxes to avoid possible infection.
Babies don't produce antibodies to T. gondii for three months after they are born, so the antibodies present in their blood represented infection in the mothers. The scientists studied Danish health patients to determine if any of these women later attempted suicide, including cases of violent suicide attempts which may have involved guns, sharp instruments and jumping from high places.
The study found that women infected with T. gondii were one and a half times more likely to attempt suicide compared to those who were not infected, and the risk seemed to rise with increasing levels of the T. gondii antibodies.
Dr Postolache noted limitations to the study, such as the inability to determine the cause of the suicidal behavior.
The findings were published online in the Archives of General Psychiatry.

 Answer: A
Context: Malaria, the world's most widespread parasitic  disease, kills as many as three million people every year--almost all of whom are under five, very poor, and African. In most years, more than five hundred million cases of illness result from the disease, although exact numbers are difficult to assess because many people don't (or can't) seek care. It is not unusual for a family earning less than two hundred dollars a year to spend a quarter of its income on malaria treatment, and what they often get no longer works. In countries like Tanzania, Mozambique, and the Gambia, no family, village, hospital, or workplace can remain unaffected for long.
Malaria starts suddenly, with violent chills, which are soon followed by an intense fever and, often, headaches. As the parasites multiply, they take over the entire body. Malaria parasites live by eating the red blood cells they infect. They can also attach themselves to blood vessels in the brain. If it doesn't kill you, malaria can happen again and again for years. The disease passed on to humans by female mosquitoes infected with one of four species of parasite. Together, the mosquito and the parasite are the most deadly couple in the history of the earth--and one of the most successful. Malaria has five thousand genes, and its ability to change rapidly to defend itself and resist new drugs has made it nearly impossible to control. Studies show that mosquitoes are passing on the virus more frequently, and there are more outbreaks in cities with large populations. Some of the disease's spread is due to global warming.
For decades, the first-choice treatment for malaria parasites in Africa has been chloroquine, a chemical which is very cheap and easy to make. Unfortunately, in most parts of the world, malaria parasites have become resistant to it. Successful alternatives that help prevent resistance are already available, but they have been in short supply and are very expensive. If these drugs should fail, nobody knows what would come next.

A. have to kill female mosquitoes 
B. have ability to defend parasites

Context: A new study shows that fat people in the United States suffer direct economic and social effects because of their size. The findings are from an 8-year study of about 100,000 people. The people who were studied were between the age of 18 and 24 when the research began.
The researchers who carried out the study say they consider the people fat if they are in the top of 5% of the measurement in which weight is linked to height. For example, fat women in the study were about 160 centimeters tall and weighed about 90 kilograms. Fat men in the study were about 175 centimeters tall and weighed 100 kilograms. The researchers say that more than 1,000,000 Americans are that big. The researchers found that fat young women were from wealthy families. The fat women also were 20% less likely to get married and they earned an average of about $6,700 a year less than other women. The study showed less
effects on fat men. They earned an average of about $3,000 a year less than other men. Fat men also were 11% less likely to get married. 
 Question:The researchers consider the people fat if    _   . 
A. they eat lots of food and do less exercise

Context: We discuss the issue of when to help a patient die. Doctors of our generation are not newcomers to this question. Going back to my internship days, I can remember many patients in pain, sometimes in coma , with late, hopeless cancer. For many of them, we wrote an order for heavy medication--morphine by the clock. This was not talked about openly and little was written about it. It was essential, not controversial.
The best way to bring the problem into focus is to describe two patients whom I cared for. The first, formerly a nurse, had an automobile accident. A few days later her lungs seemed to fill up; her heart developed dangerous rhythm disturbances. So there she was: in coma, on a breathing machine, her heartbeat maintained with an electrical device. One day after rounds, my secretary said the husband and son of the patient wanted to see me. They told me their wife and mother was obviously going to die; she was a nurse and had told her family that she never wanted this kind of terrible death, being maintained by machines. I told them that while I respected their view, there was nothing deadly about her situation. The kidney  failure she had was just the kind for which the artificial kidney was most effective. While possibly a bit reassured, they were disappointed. Here was the head surgeon seemingly determined to keep everybody alive, no matter what.
Within a few days the patient's pacemaker  could be removed and she awoke from her coma. About six months later, the door of my office opened and in walked a gloriously fit woman. After some cheery words of appreciation, the father and son asked to speak to me alone. As soon as the door closed, both men became quite tearful. All that came out was, ""We want you to know how wrong we were.""
The second patient was an 85-year-old lady whose hair caught fire while she was smoking. She arrived with a deep burn; I knew it would surely be deadly. As a remarkable coincidence there was a meeting for discussion going on at the time in medical ethics . The speaker asked me if I had any sort of ethical problem I could bring up for discussion. I described the case and asked the students their opinion. After the discussion, I made a remark that was, when looking back, a serious mistake. I said, ""I'll take the word back to the nurses about her and we will talk about it some more before we decide."" The instructor and the students were shocked: ""You mean this is a real patient?"" The teacher of ethics was not accustomed to being challenged by actuality. In any event, I went back and met with the nurses. A day or two later, when she was making no progress and was suffering terribly, we began to back off treatment. Soon she died quietly and not in pain. As a reasonable physician, you had better move ahead and do what you would want done for you. And don't discuss it with the world first. There is a lesson here for everybody. Assisting people to leave this life requires strong judgment and long experience to avoid its misuse. 
 Question:The author suggested that doctors  _   before they assist a patient in killing himself. 
A. do what they are wanted to do 
B. discuss with the others about the decision first 
C. be required to do so first by the patient 
D. make sure there is no other choice left 
 Answer: D
Context: I was in my first year of college, making friends and enjoying life, but then my whole world turned upside down. I had a heart attack. It felt like someone was stabbing   me in the chest with a knife over and over again.
After three months of rest I went back to college, but then things took a turn for the worse. I was staying at my Nana's house and woke up in the middle of the night with a terrible pain in my chest. I knew I was having a heart attack again.
I couldn't even shout for help. Luckily my grandpa was going to the toilet and heard me falling out of bed. If it wasn't for him, I probably wouldn't be here.
The two holes in my heart were causing the problems and I needed an operation immediately to repair them. Unfortunately, the surgery didn't go well and they only managed to repair one of the holes.
When I woke up from the operation, I had a really dry mouth and couldn't wait to have something to eat and drink. The biggest shock of all came when I was told that I needed a heart transplant and was put on the register. The doctors were stunned at how quickly heart failure came on - it usually takes years, but it took my heart less than six months to get to that stage. My whole world came crashing down, but I stayed strong. It was a choice between crying every day and getting on with my life.
As time went on, life became even harder. I hated feeling weak all the time and needing help with everything. It got to the point where I thought I would never get a new heart. I was diagnosed with depression.
Even though I thought that Christmas 2008 would be my last, I really enjoyed it and even had a good New Year. Everyone was crying for me when the clock struck midnight and they told me to keep fighting.
A week later, I got a call from the doctors saying they'd found a suitable donor  . My wish came true and thankfully the operation went well. I spent four hours in surgery where they took out my old heart and put a new one in. When I woke up I burst out crying. I had a second chance at life. 
 Question:When the author learned that he needed a heart transplant, he   _  . 
A. couldn't help crying every day 
B. chose to continue to fight for his life 
C. felt so depressed that he tried to kill himself 
D. was so anxious that his heart failure developed very quickly 
 Answer: B
Context: The research tracked the health of 101,000 US nurses over three decades.
Light-to-moderate smokers were twice as likely to die of sudden heart problems as those who had never smoked.
But those who quit smoking saw their risk begin to go back down within years, a journal of the American Heart Association reports.
 _ 
During the study, there were 315 sudden cardiac deaths ----where the heart unexpectedly stops working.
In people aged 35 or younger, this usually because of a heart condition that runs in the family.
But in people who are older than this--as most of the nurses in the study were --it can be the first sign of coronary heart disease, where the heart's arteries become blocked by fatty deposits.
Of the 315 sudden deaths in the study, 75 were among current smokers, 148 were among recent or past smokers and 128 occurred in people who had never smoked.
Reason to quit
After taking into account other heart risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and family history of heart disease, Dr Roopinder Sandhu and his colleagues found the women who smoked were twice as likely as likely to die suddenly even if they smoked ""light-to-moderate"" amounts --between one and 14 cigarettes a day.
For every five years of continued smoking, the risk went up by 8%.
But women who quit saw their risk fall to that of someone who had never smoked, after 20 years of cessation.
Dr Sandhu, of the University of Alberta, Canad, said: ""What this study really tells women is how important it is to stop smoking. The benefits in terms of sudden cardiac death reduction are there for all women, not just those with established heart disease.""
""It can be difficult to quit. It needs to be a long-term goal. It's not always easily achievable and it may take more than one attempt.""
Ellen Mason, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""This study shows that smoking just a couple of cigarettes a day could still seriously affect your future health.""
""As we approach the new year, many of us will be making resolutions and giving up smoking will be the top of the list for lots of people.""
""If you're thinking of quitting and need a _ , this research adds to the wealth of evidence that stopping smoking is the single best thing you can do for your heart health.""
A recent study in The Lancet of 1.2million Women found those who gave up smoking by the age of 30 would almost completely avoid the risk of dying early from tobacco-related diseases.
Latest figures suggest a fifth of women in England smoke. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE? 
A. Nonsmokers wouldn't die of sudden cardiac death 
B. Most of the nurses concerned in the research were middle aged. 
C. All age groups of people were involved in the research. 
D. If the smokers had quit smoking, they wouldn't have died of heart disease. 
 Answer: B
Context: Smaller than your fist, your healthy heart just goes on and on. It will beat more than 60 times a minute for 70 years or more. That's something that most of us take for granted. But it's an amazing fact.
60 times a minute for 60 minutes is 3,600 times. What physical thing can most of us do 3,600 times in one hour? Blink? Maybe. Tap our fingers on the desk? No. Jump up and down? Certainly not! But our heart keeps beating, hour after hour. Every day, it pumps almost 2,000 gallons of blood through our blood vessels . It takes you about five years to drink 2,000 gallons of water.
And, unlike your knees or your back, your heart does all this work without ever complaining ! You never know that it's even there. Your heart is such a reliable ""silent partner"" that people forget to care for it. For many, the first indication that their heart isn't working properly is a serious heart illness! Over 650,000 Americans die of some kind of heart disease every year. Cancer kills 560,000, stroke kills 143,000, and accidents kill 118,000 Americans annually.
Like accidental deaths, many heart disease-related deaths can be avoided if people simply follow the advice of the experts. Unfortunately, most people seem to listen to a little voice in their head that says, ""It won't happen to me. "" So these people keep on smoking and drinking. They continue to eat too much meat. And their only ""exercise"" is getting off the sofa to get something out of the fridge. Please follow the following steps to keep your heart healthy.

Context: Recently, a student used his Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) to film a female teacher scolding and tearing the work of a classmate. The public discussion that the incident caused started on the Internet. However, when it came to the media's attention, it quickly became a major topic in the education circles. The reactions so far suggest that the focus of the debate has been on one question: whom to blame?
Teachers who are anxious to defend their professional dignity have tried to put the blame on the students. They mentioned their right to privacy )and for this reason they requested the Ministry of Education (MOE) to prohibit PDAs in schools. On the other hand, some parents and students have taken a different position. They feel that the teacher is also at fault. Caught up in the war of words between both sides, people are no longer interested in the ""truth"" of the matter which seems now unimportant. It was left to newspapers to discover the central point of the controversial issue, by stressing the problems that are not always easily noticed in our educational system.
For those responsible for educating the young, this PDA incident conveys the message that ""Times have changed"",a reality that must have been felt even more strongly by the female teacher when reflecting on this unpleasant experience. Different times call for different professional approaches in education. The ability to understand the students they are teaching has always been the quality of successful teachers. Despite some factors, the incident shows that the teacher lacks good qualities on her part. Besides, the rules under current system to deal with recalcitrant students need to be improved. Also, it is an example which shows the issue we are familiar with: what to do with new technology? With PDA, the new technology, the interaction  between the teacher and students in classroom has been changed. 
 Question:The writer's attitude toward the PDA incident is  _  . 
A. optimistic 
B. critical 
C. uncertain 
D. approval 
 Answer: B
Context: As the father of a student, I have experienced first hand what a great teacher is. My son was in the 4thgrade last year, and he had a teacher called Miss Green. I believe that when he is an adult he will surely look back on her as the best teacher he has ever had.
My son has attention deficit disorder  that makes it a little more difficult for him to learn. She was able to change her teaching methods for him so that he could keep up with the rest of the class. As a result, he got straight As on many subjects. She regarded her class as a family and they even had their own class song. She would often have them sing it to encourage them and develop a team spirit for them. When she saw that they were no longer listening carefully to what she was teaching, she would have them close their textbooks, stand up all around the room and throw around a small football. This helped them clear their minds and then _ the lesson again. Besides, she was quick to reply to any phone calls or emails from us and got rid of our worries about children quickly.
When my son went to the 5thgrade this year, we happened to pass her classroom. When she saw my son, her face lit up  and she came out and hugged him. She generally loves all of the children in her classroom and that love really shows. I can only pray  that my son will continue to get teachers just like her for the rest of his school years. 
 Question:With the teacher's help, the writer's son   _  . 
A. became the best student in his class 
B. was interested in singing songs 
C. quickly finished his 4

D. improved his grades greatly

Context: ""A very disruptive  six-year-old child kicked my legs and clawed at my hand,"" said one teacher. "" I broke up a fight and was kicked between my legs,"" said another. Many people have heard stories like this. But the situation is more worrying still and it involves parents.
Every child, regardless of the circumstances into which they are born, has the right to achieve their potential, regardless of their parents' wealth and class. And we recognize that, as a nation, it is a long way to achieve this goal. But with rights come responsibilities and what worries people is that we are in danger of ignoring the latter.
Far too many children are behaving badly at school, even to the point of being violent to staff. This is terrible enough, but it is hard to be surprised since many children are just mirroring the behaviour of their parents.
My members tell me that parents also come into school often and threaten staff and some staff have been attacked by a pupil's parents. One father encouraged his child to start a fight on the playground before school started. A primary teacher reported that a parent shouted at him. We need to have a serious and sensible debate about the roles and responsibilities of parents and the support that they can reasonably expect of schools and teachers.
Children will not learn how to behave as social beings if they are stuck in front of the TV for hours every day. They need their parents to show an interest in them and to spend time with them, helping them to play with their peers  and to learn the rules of social behavior.
Children are now arriving at school socially undeveloped, increasingly unable to dress themselves, unable to use the toilet properly, unable to hold a knife and fork and unused to eating at a table, Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, writes in today's Observer. Instead of taking responsibility themselves, too many parents expect teachers to control their children's behaviour and wellbeing, she adds. Bousted says one mother blamed staff when she discovered that her 16-year-old son was smoking.
We are in danger of becoming a nation of _ . The bedroom, once a place to sleep, has become the living space for the young. Spending hours in front of computer screens, on social networking sites or being immersed  in computer games, children and young people spend little time with their parents. Parents are unable to monitor just what their children are watching.
Schools cannot right the wrongs of society and teachers cannot become substitute parents. Both parties need to work together. Parents must be helped and given confidence to take back control. They are responsible for setting boundaries for their children's behaviour and sticking to those boundaries. They are responsible for setting a good example to their children and for devoting that most precious of resources -- time -- so that children come to school ready and willing to learn. 
 Question:The author's attitude to the behaviour of parents may be   _  . 
A. dissatisfied

Context: Britain's smallest school was closed down because its only pupil failed to turn up for class, a famous Britain newspaper reported in May.
The newspaper said the six-year-old girl's parents were unhappy with a teacher who just got the new job to teach the only pupil.
The school had been closed for the last nine months after its former teacher retired and the only other pupil moved on to a secondary school. The new teacher, Ms. Puckey was to start teaching the girl and reopen the school.
But the girl's mother is keeping her daughter at home.
""I was not pleased with the new teacher,""the mother said. ""I had told the old teacher as far back as last September that if Ms. Puckey got the job, my child would not be going to school.""
The school lies on an island off the northeast of Scotland. Although there was only one pupil, the school is very good in many ways and has a headmaster, three computers, a television, and an art room as well as a school house with three bedrooms. 
 Question:The reading does not say but we can infer_. 
A. the girl's mother had only one child 
B. the new teacher was not kind to the girl 
C. the old teacher was fit to teach the girl 
D. the parents were unhappy with the school

Context: Every living thing on Earth is either a plant or an animal, right? Wrong! Many organisms in our world are neither. Some of them float through the air, and some lie hidden in the ground. They do not need sunlight to survive, and if the weather becomes too cold, they can become inactive until conditions improve.
What are these? They are called fungi , and you see them almost every day. Many kinds of fungi seem _ , such as the green black things that appear on the food which are left too long in the refrigerator. But other kinds are not so bad. For example, the yeast that is used to make bread and mushrooms   are both fungi.
What makes fungi different from plants and animals? An animal can move around by itself. Fungi get around too, but they don't have feet, wings, or tails. They have to wait for wind or some other outside force to move them. Plants are different from fungi because they have chlorophyll . It helps them make food from the energy in sunlight. Fungi do not have chlorophyll.
Some fungi are bad, while others are not. Some fungi cause diseases, such as athlete's foot, which makes feet uncomfortable. Other kinds of fungi can be used to make medicines, which have saved many lives.
Fungi clean up more than wounds, though. They are the world's first recyclers. Without fungi, our world would be a mess. Since fungi cannot make their own food as plants do, they must get their food elsewhere. Many fungi get their food from dead plants. They break them down and turn them into soil. The fungi get a meal, and the world gets a housecleaning. 
 Question:According to the passage,   _  . 
A. fungi can move everywhere by themselves 
B. fungi are unable to survive in cold conditions 
C. some fungi can make food from the energy in sunlight. 
D. some fungi are useful to humans and the environment 
 Answer: D
Context: Plants, like animals, are subject to diseases of various kinds.It has been estimated that some 30,000 different diseases attack our economic plants; forty are known to attack corn, and about as many attack wheat.The results of unchecked plant disease are all too obvious in countries which have marginal food supplies.The problem will soon be more widespread as the population of the world increases at its frightening rate.Even in countries which are now amply fed by their agricultural products there could soon be the major crops; the resulting famines  could kill millions of people, and the resulting hardship on other millions could cause political upheavals  disastrous to the order of the world.
Some plants have relative immunity to a great many diseases, while others have a susceptibility to them.A blight   may be but a local infection easily controlled; on the other hand it can attack particular plants in a whole region or nation.An example is the blight which killed virtually every chestnut tree in North America.Another is the famous potato blight in Ireland in the last century.As a result of that, it was estimated that one million people died of starvation and related ailments.
Plant pathologists have made remarkable strides in identifying the pathogens of the various diseases.Bacteria may invade a plant through an infestation of insect parasites carrying the pathogen.A plant can also be inoculated by man.Other diseases might be caused by fungus which attacks the plant in the form of a model or smut or rust.Frequently such a primary infection will weaken the plant so that a secondary infection may result form its lack of tolerance.The symptoms  shown may cause an error in diagnosis, so that treatment may be directed toward bacteria  which could be the result of a susceptibility caused by a primary virus infection. 
 Question:How many diseases are known to attack wheat? 
A. Around 30000 
B. Forty 
C. Around 29960 
D. Around 40 
 Answer: D
Context: Women who own cats are more likely to have mental health problems and kill themselves because they can be infected by a common parasite that can be caught from cat litter, a study has found.
Researchers found women infected with the Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) parasite , which is spread through contact with cat waste or eating undercooked meat or unwashed vegetables, are at increased risk of attempting suicide.
The study involved more than 45,000 women in Denmark. About a third of the world's population is infected with the parasite, which hides in cells in the brain and muscles, often without producing symptoms.
The infection, which is called toxoplasmosis , has been linked to mental illness, such as schizophrenia , and changes in behavior.
The study's senior author Doctor Teodor Postolache, an associate professor of psychiatry  at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in the United States, said, ""We can't say with certainty that T. gondii caused the women to try to kill themselves, but we did find a predictive association between the infection and suicide attempts later in life that deserves additional studies.""
Doctor Albert Reece, vice president of medical affairs at the University of Maryland, said, ""T. gondii infection is a major public health problem around the world, and many people don't realize they're infected.
""Dr Postolache is a leading expert on suicide neuroimmunology . Suicide is a critically important mental health issue. About one million people commit suicide and another 10 million attempt suicide worldwide each year. We hope that this type of research will one day help us find ways to save many lives that now end too early in suicide.""
Dr. Postolache's research team at the University of Maryland was the first to report a connection between T. gondii and suicidal behavior in 2009. He is cooperating with researchers in Denmark, Germany and Sweden to confirm and investigate the way leading to this association.
The T. gondii parasite thrives in the intestines of cats, and it is spread through their waste. All warm-blooded animals can become infected through contact with it. Humans can become infected by changing their infected cats' litter boxes, eating unwashed vegetables, drinking water from a polluted source, or by eating undercooked or raw meat.
Not washing kitchen knives after preparing raw meat before handling another food item also can lead to infection. Pregnant women can pass the parasite directly to their unborn babies and are advised not to change cat litter boxes to avoid possible infection.
Babies don't produce antibodies to T. gondii for three months after they are born, so the antibodies present in their blood represented infection in the mothers. The scientists studied Danish health patients to determine if any of these women later attempted suicide, including cases of violent suicide attempts which may have involved guns, sharp instruments and jumping from high places.
The study found that women infected with T. gondii were one and a half times more likely to attempt suicide compared to those who were not infected, and the risk seemed to rise with increasing levels of the T. gondii antibodies.
Dr Postolache noted limitations to the study, such as the inability to determine the cause of the suicidal behavior.
The findings were published online in the Archives of General Psychiatry. 
 Question:What is the consequence if a woman is infected with the parasite in the passage? 
A. Having a high fever. 
B. Doing deliberate self-harm. 
C. Keeping a depressed mood. 
D. Becoming bad tempered.

Context: Salt plays an important role in our daily diet. Even a small reduction in salt in the diet can be a big help to the heart. A new study used a computer model to predict -how just three grams less a day would affect heart disease in the United States.
The result: Thirteen percent fewer heart attacks. Eight percent fewer strokes. Four percent fewer deaths. Eleven percent fewer new cases of heart disease. And two hundred forty billion dollars in health care savings. Researchers found it could prevent one hundred thousand heart attacks and ninety-two thousand deaths every year.
The study is in the New England Journal of Medicine. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo at the University of California San Francisco was the lead author. She says people would not even notice a difference in taste with three grams,or one-half teaspoon, less salt per day. The team also included researchers at Stanford and Columbia University. Each gram of salt contains four hundred milligrams of sodiu , which is how foods may list their salt content.
The government says the average American man eats ten grams of salt a day. The American Heart Association advises no more than three grams for healthy people. It says salt in the American diet has increased fifty percent since the nineteen seventies, while blood pressures have also risen. Less salt can mean a lower blood pressure.
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is leading an effort called the National Salt Reduction Initiative.The idea is to put pressure on food companies and restaurants. Critics call it government interference.
Mayor Bloomberg has already succeeded in other areas, like requiring fast food places in the city to list calorie information. Now a study by the Seattle Children's Research Institute shows that the calorie information on the menu can influence what parents order for their children. Ninety-nine parents of three to six year olds took part. Half had calories between the two groups for foods that the parents would have chosen for themselves. McDonald's menus clearly showing how many calories were in each food. Parents given the counts chose an average of one hundred two fewer calories when asked what they would order for their children. Yet there was no difference in calories between the two groups for foods that the parents would have chosen for themselves.
Study leader Pooja Tandon says even small calorie reductions on a regular basis can prevent weight gain over time.The study was published in the journal Pediatrics. 
 Question:The National Salt Reduction Initiative aims to  _  . 
A. inform people of the harm that salt does to health 
B. attract the public attention to the problem 
C. require fast food places to list salt information 
D. put pressure on food companies and restaurants 
 Answer: D
Context: For all dinner tables, a glass of milk seems to be a must. At least it was when I was growing up. It is widely believed that milk is a must in building strong bones and teeth. There's no doubt that dairy products, especially milk, are high in protein and calcium, and Vitamin D and Vitamin A are added to most milk products.
While it's well known that our bones need calcium, some studies suggest that high calcium intake doesn't necessarily lower a person's risk for fractures . A Harvard study found that people who drank two or more glasses of milk had no greater protection from breaking a bone than those who drank a glass or less a week.
There is no doubt that we need calcium. Some anti-dairy supporters claim dairy products can lead to heart disease. Much of this claim is based on high-fat dairy products, like cheese and cream, which may indeed lead to some health problems. Some studies have linked high milk intakes with a risk of prostate cancer; this seems also to be caused by high-fat dairy products, but not by dairy products in general.
Although milk has always been regarded as the most important thing we need for our bones, one of the most important things in strengthening bones and reducing the risk of osteoporosis is weight-bearing exercise, such as jogging, walking, and weight lifting.
Perhaps we should think of dairy products as less like a nutrient and more like a food. If you like it, eat it. If not, find something else to eat. Some claims may not be completely true. When I eat cream, I'm not thinking about calcium, protein, or any such thing. I'm thinking it is delicious. 
 Question:Based on the passage, we learn the writer may agree that   _  . 
A. milk is the most important thing that we need for our bones 
B. children should not be permitted to eat cream 
C. milk should be considered more like a food than a nutrient 
D. children should drink milk whether they like it or not 
 Answer: C
Context: In Sonoma County, California, growers are planting grapevines in a new way. As they plant the vines, they add a package of water called DRiWATER. This method of planting grapevines along with the water supply saves time and work. It gives the plant enough water to keep growing. The workers can go on to other chores.
DRiWATER is a package of jelled   water. It melts slowly, watering the plant for two or three months. DRiWATER is a 100% natural, non-poisonous product used for the long-term watering of plants. It was invented by a well-known food chemist who recognized the potential of a filler product he was using to thicken peanut butter. He tested and applied his theory that water could be released over time as naturally occurring microbes   in the soil fed on the filler and released the water into the soil.
The inventor, Harold Jensen, tried for a long time to get the right recipe. He and his family worked nights and weekends testing different formulas. Jensen finally found the right formula and patented it.
What are the ingredients in DRiWATER? It is made up of 97.85% water, 2% vegetable gum, and 0.15% aluminum sulfate. When the DRiWATER is planted in the soil, the water is released as bacteria eat the jell.
Buchanan Vineyard Services has bought ten thousand packages of DRiWATER. They will plant the jelled water with their new grapevines.
What about countries like Egypt that have large deserts? Maybe DRiWATER will help grow trees in the desert. Two million trees have been planted near a town in the Sahara Desert. Two quarts were planted with each tree. The tree must live on the water for months until its roots touch ground water. Harold Jensen hopes to see forests spring up in the deserts. This is the reason that he invented DRiWATER. Seedlings, DRiWATER, and desert may be the perfect fit. 
 Question:What is the best title for the passage? 
A. How to plant grapevines well. 
B. A unique method to supply water to plants. 
C. Harold Jensen: a great inventor. 
D. DRiWATER and the Sahara Desert. 
 Answer: B
Context: The price of milk may be going up. There was not enough rain in some parts of the country last year and the bad weather may mean that a gallon   of milk will cost 41 cents more after October 1st.
California already has high milk prices and the California court does not want the price to go any higher. High milk prices will be very hard for some people. Families with many children will have to spend more money to buy milk. The poor and older people without much money will also be hurt by higher prices.
The court said that more milk from other states should be sold in California as the price of milk from other states is not as high. Some states got enough rain so their costs did not go up. People will then be able to buy the cheaper milk, meaning that unless milk producers bring their milk prices down, their milk will not sell.
The drought   around the country has meant market forces are likely to push milk prices up by as much as 41-cent a gallon by October 1st. Experts said this decision by the Californian court could reduce   the effect of the price rise here.
The 41-cent increase would add to California's already high milk prices so California must allow more milk producers from outside the state to sell their products there. This would then lead to increased supplies  , which would, as a result, stop milk prices from increasing. 
 Question:What will California do to keep milk prices down? 
A. Force milk producers to lower their price. 
B. Encourage people to drink less milk. 
C. Get men to produce more rain. 
D. Increase the supply of milk in the state.

Context: One Sunday, my family had gathered at my parents' house to feast upon Mom's wonderful cooking. During the normal dinner chatter  , I noticed that my father was slurring   his words. No one mentioned this during dinner, but I felt compelled to discuss it with my mother afterward.
We decided that there was something seriously wrong and that Dad needed to see the doctor.
Mom phoned me two days later. ""The doctor found a brain tumor  . It's too large at this point to operate. Maybe they can do something then, but _ .""
Even with the treatment, my father's condition worsened, and the doctor finally informed us that this condition was terminal  . During one of his stays in the hospital, we brought our baby daughter Chelsey with us when we visited him. By this time he had great difficulty speaking. I finally figured out that he wanted Chelsey to sit on his stomach so he could make faces at her.
Watching the two of them together, I realized I was living an experience that would stay with me forever. Though grateful for the times they could share, I couldn't shake the feeling of a clock ticking in the background.
On the visit to my parents' home during what we all know was my father's last days, my mother took Chelsey from my arms and announced, ""Your father would like to see you alone for a minute.""
I entered the bedroom where my father lay on a rented hospital bed. He appeared even weaker than the day before.
""How are you feeling, Dad?"" I asked. ""Can I do anything for you?""
He tried to speak, but he couldn't make out a word.
""I'm sorry, but I can't understand you,"" I said.
With great difficulty he said, ""I love you.""
We don't learn courage from heroes on the evening news. We learn true courage from watching ordinary people rise above hopeless situations. In many ways my father was a strict, uncommunicative man. He found it difficult to show emotion. The bravest thing I ever saw him do was overcome that barrier to open his heart to his son and family at the end of his life.

Context: Book into the new prefix = st1 /AucklandHospitalat a typical hour, say 11 on a Saturday night, and you will notice changes in the way you are treated.
Let's start with the blood sample taken from your arm as you are wheeled in the door. 
By the time you are through the security doors and into the emergency area, that sample could have been sent through to the lab by vacuum tube and analysed by a machine which automatically feeds a preparative result into the clinical database. 
Less than a minute after the sample is processed, the doctors can see the results through the monitors beside every position in the emergency suites. 
As you are being wheeled in, you may notice cameras in the ceiling. The hospital has spent $4 million on its camera security system to protect staff and patients. 
When you come to in the neighbouring Admission and Planning Unit, the clinician  may be looking at all your records, x-rays and even documents sent in by your GP on a Compaq tablet PC wirelessly connected to the network by an 802.11 ""WiFi"" card. 
It's not ideal for viewing images, but it should be good enough for a bedside consultation . 
If the clinician needs to consult a specialist or your GP, the other party can see the same records from home or office through a secure internet connection.

Context: An idea came to me, and I turned off the lights in the studio.In the darkness, I took off my shirt and took up the cello  ; it was the first time in my life I'd felt the instrument against my bare chest.I'd never thought about that; music scholars always talk about the resonating properties   of various instruments, but surely the performer's own body must have some effect on the sound.As I dug into the notes I imagined that my own chest and lungs were extensions of the sound box; I seemed to be able to change the sound by the way I sat, and by varying the muscular tightness in my upper body.
After improvising for a while, I started playing, still in the darkness.I heard the music through my skin.For the first time I didn't think about how it would sound to anyone else, and slowly, joyfully, gratefully, I started to hear again.The notes sang out, first like a trickle:, then like a fountain of cool water bubbling up from a hole in the middle of a desert.After an hour or so I looked up, and in the darkness saw the outline of the cat sitting on the floor in front of me, cleaning her paws and purring loudly, I had an audience again, humble as it was.
So that's what I do now with my cello.At least once a day I find time to tune it, close my eyes and listen.It's probably not going to lead to the kind of comeback I'd be thirsty for--years of playing badly have left scars on my technique--but I might eventually try giving a concert if I feel up to it.
Occasionally I feel a stab of longing, and I wish I could give just one more concert on a great stage before my lights blink off, but that longing passes more quickly now.I take comfort in the fact that, unlike the way I felt before, I can enjoy playing for myself now.I feel relaxed and expansive when I play, as if I could stretch out my arms and reach from one end of the apartment to the other.A feeling of completeness and dignity surrounds me and lifts me up. 
 Question:The passage is mainly about   _  . 
A. a musician playing the cello for an audience 
B. a musician's feelings when playing the cello 
C. a musician finding joy in playing music in a new way 
D. a musician's desire to return to his former profession

Context: The World Health Organization (WHO) planned to study the relationship between the eating habits of the people and the disease. Two doctors were chosen to make the study. They flew to Africa south of the Sahara and during the next two months visited ten countries. They found that serious diseases of poor eating, often mistaken for other diseases, existed in all parts of Africa. The diseases were similar and could therefore all be named kwashiorkor. The diseased children are usually from one to four years old. As the illness progresses, the child's stomach becomes swollen by liquid collecting in the body. The skin changes color and may break out in open sores . The hair changes color and starts to fall out. The patient loses all interest in his surroundings and even in food, and becomes so weak that he wants to lie down all the time. Stomach liquids are no longer produced.
The doctors reasoned that kwashiorkor was found in the young children of this age in many parts of Africa because of lack of milk or meat. Their mothers, after stopping their breastfeeding, gave them foods full of starches instead of greatly needed proteins. They found that the addition of milk to the food of the children suffering from kwashiorkor saved many lives.
The unbelievable thing about kwashiorkor is that the very existence of the disease--which has been killing thousands of children for centuries--was not even recognized in Latin America as recently as ten years ago. The deaths of those children were mistakenly listed as due to other diseases. It was the WHO's work in Africa that led to the discovery of the problem in Central America. 
 Question:It is difficult to discover kwashiorkor because   _   . 
A. it has no symptoms at all 
B. it is hard to identify signs of it 
C. it doesn't last long enough for careful observation 
D. it is hardly different from other diseases

Context: When Siva Kalyan was born, his backbone was deformed resulting in a lifelong difficulty in walking. But that hasn't stopped the nine-year-old from becoming a prodigy .
Until he was three-and-a-half years old, Siva could not even crawl. Wanting the best treatment for their son, Siva's parents moved with him from India to Australia and later to the USA.
In the USA, his parents enrolled him in the second grade based on his age. But his teachers soon realized they had a genius. Siva was then tested for the eighth grade, but it was soon found out that he was actually qualified for college courses. As one advanced course was not enough, the brilliant boy is now taking two courses from Stanford University. Due to the treatment he received, Siva's physical condition has improved as well.
But none of  _ ""just happened"". It was his parents' understanding and correct guidance, and the loving care of his grandparents that contributed to the growth of the genius. Siva's highly educated and hardworking family has brought him up on the basis of certain principles.
The family believes that once a strong foundation is built for the child in English and mathematics, the child is equipped to master any other subject, law, history, or engineering. It is equally important to recognize the strengths of a child rather than forcing the child to do things that he may not want to do.
Siva's parents helped. Siva focus his energies on his strength, which is mathematics. At the same time they took care to see that he had friends to play with and enjoyed a few recreational activities. The only activity that's restricted for Siva is viewing television. Siva watches TV only for 30 minutes a day and video games are a bonus for special occasions.
Thanks to his mother who is a singer, Siva has also learned music and even won the first and second prize at two competitions. In sports, he likes to swim. He began to learn swimming to strengthen his muscles, and by the age of eight he was able to swim a kilometer in both the backstroke and the freestyle. 
 Question:Why did Siva's parents move to the USA? 
A. They wanted to give their son the best education. 
B. They wanted their son to receive the best treatment. 
C. They weren't used to life in India or Australia. 
D. They wanted their son to go to Stanford University.

Context: How much rain has fallen on the earth in the past? Man has not always kept weather records. Because scientists need a way to learn about past rainfall, they study the tree rings.
A tree's trunk   keeps growing year by year. Under its bark  , a tree adds a layer of new wood each year it lives. If you look at a tree stump, you can see the layers. They are called annual ring  .
On some trees, all of the rings are of the same width. But the ponderosa  that grows in the American southwest have rings in different withes. The soil in he southwest is dry. The pines depend on rainfall for water. In a year of good rainfall, they form wide rings. In a dry year, they form narrow ones.
Scientists do not have to cut down a pine to study its rings. With a special tool, they remove a narrow piece of wood from the trunk without harming the tree. Then they look at the width of each ring to see how much rain fell in the year it formed.
Some pines are hundreds of years old and have hundreds of rings. These rings are from an annual record o0f past rainfall in the southwest. 
 Question:A tree grows a new layer of wood   _  . 
A. each week 
B. whenever it rains 
C. every year 
D. every season 
 Answer: C
Context: Plants need green leaves to make food. A plant needs sunlight and carbon dioxide  from the air for making food and it also needs water and salts from the soil to make food too. There are certain cells   in the leaves which change carbon dioxide and water into sugar. To do this the cells needs energy, which they get from the sunlight.
Green leaves make food for the whole plant. A red leaf can make food too because under the red color1ing of the leaf there are food----making cells. There are no leaves which are completely yellow, for they can't make food.
The plant makes sugar for its food. In sunlight green leaves make a lot of sugar. The veins   can't carry all this sugar away, so the leaves change the sugar into starch  , which is kept and so stored in the leaves. At night, the starch changes back to sugar. It is then carried away from the leaves. Some of the sugar is used as food by the plant while the rest is stored as starch. In some plants, food is stored in the roots, in others it is stored in the stem   and in leaves, fruits and seeds. 
 Question:Sugar is made for its food by   _  . 
A. sunlight 
B. veins 
C. stems 
D. green leaves

Context: The relationship between exercise and cancer has long both intrigued and puzzled oncologists and exercise physiologists.
Exercise is strongly associated with lowered risks for many types of cancer. At the same time, exercise involves biological stress, which typically leads to a short-term increase in inflammation  which can contribute to higher risks for many cancers.
Now, a new study in mice may offer some clues into the exercise-cancer paradox. It suggests that exercise may change how the immune system deals with cancer by boosting adrenaline , certain immune cells and other chemicals that, together, can reduce the severity of cancer or fight it off altogether.
To try to better understand how exercise can both elevate inflammation and simultaneously protect the body against cancer, scientists at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and other institutions decided to closely examine what happens inside mice at high risk for the disease.
So, for the new study, they began by gathering a group of adult lab mice. These animals generally like to run.
The scientists then implanted melanoma   skin cancer cells into the mice before providing half of them with running wheels in their cages while the other animals remained sedentary. After four weeks, far fewer of the runners had developed full-blown melanoma than the sedentary mice and those that had been diagnosed with the disease showed fewer and smaller lesions.
They drew blood from both the exercising and sedentary animals and cells from any tumors in both groups. As expected, they found much higher levels of the hormone adrenaline in the blood of the exercising animals, especially right after they had been working out on the wheels but also at other times of the day. The body releases adrenaline in response to almost any type of stressful experience, including exercise.
They also found higher levels of interleukin-6 in the blood of the runners. This is a substance that is released by working muscles and is believed to both increase and decrease inflammation in the body, depending on where and how it goes to work.
Perhaps most important, they found much higher numbers in the bloodstreams of runners than in the sedentary mice of a type of immune cell named natural killer cells that are known to be strong cancer fighters.
So the scientists repeated their original experiment multiple times, inducing cancer while allowing some mice to run and others to sit. In some of these follow-up experiments, the scientists injected the runners with a substance that blocked the production of adrenaline and gave sedentary animals large doses of added adrenaline.
What they now found was that when running mice could not produce adrenaline, they developed cancer at the same rate as the sedentary animals, while the sedentary animals that had been injected with extra adrenaline fought off their tumors better than other sitting mice.
More remarkably, the scientists determined that adrenaline seemed to be sending biochemical signals to some of the animals' IL-6 cells, making them physiologically more alert, so that when a tumor began to develop in the affected animal, those IL-6 cells in turn activated the natural killer cells in the bloodstream and actually directed them to the tumors, like minute guide fish.
With these results, ""we show that voluntary wheel running in mice can reduce the growth of tumors, and we have identified an exercise-dependent mobilization of natural killer cells as the underlying cause of this protection,"" said Pernille Hojman, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen who oversaw the new study. It perhaps provides one more incentive for us to get up and move. 
 Question:In the first experiment, which one is the most important result the scientists found? 
A. Natural killer cells are much more in the bloodstreams of runners than in the sedentary mice. 
B. Levels of interleukin-6 are higher in the blood of the runners than in the sedentary mice. 
C. Exercise such as running seemed to help the mice fight against the cancer. 
D. Adrenaline can reduce the severity of cancer or fight it off.

Context: Perhaps it is hard to imagine that a bad tooth could be deadly. But doctors in the Washington area say a twelveyearold boy died last month of a tooth infection that spread to his brain. They say it might have been prevented if the boy had received the dental care he needed.
Experts at the National Institutes of Health say good dental care should start at birth. They say breast milk is the best food for the healthy development of teeth. Breast milk can help slow bacterial growth and acid production in the mouth.
When baby's teeth begin to appear,you can clean them with a wet toothbrush. Dentists say it is important to find soft toothbrushes made especially for babies,and use them very gently.
The use of fluoride   to protect teeth is common in many parts of the world. This natural element is often added to drinking water supplies. The fluoride mixes with enamel ,the hard surface on teeth,to help prevent holes,or cavities from forming.
But the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry points out that young children often swallow toothpaste when they brush their teeth. The group notes that swallowing fluoridated toothpaste can cause problems. So young children should be carefully supervised when they brush their teeth. And only a small amount of fluoridated toothpaste,the size of a green pea,should be used.
Parents often wonder what effects sucking a thumb or sucking on a pacifier might have on their baby's teeth. Dental experts generally agree that this is fine early in life.
The American Academy of Family Physicians says most kids stop sucking their thumbs by the age of four. If it continues,the group advises parents to talk to their child's dentist or doctor. It could influence the correct development of permanent teeth.

A. his tooth disease was very deadly 
B. the doctor refused to treat him properly 
C. he didn't receive timely treatment 
D. something was wrong with his brain

Context: I had about 10 minutes to exercise before I had to pick up my two older daughters from school yesterday. It was a busier day than usual for me with a couple of meetings besides my regular work.
Years ago, I would have put off my workout and would have left things for the next day. But since it was a busy day as well, I knew that I may not have all that much time either. So, I picked up my kettle-bell   and _ for 4 minutes.
See, 4 minutes, if that's all you've got, is enough to give your body a great fat-burning exercise. How did I get a killer workout in 4 minutes? I used a training workout discovered 10 years ago by a Japanese Sports Scientist called a TABATA.
It includes 20-second periods of warm-up, followed by 10-second periods of rest and 4-minute straight exercise. How is a 4-minute exercise able to burn fat? It all depends on the quality of work you do. Not on the quantity. Here's how I did it yesterday.
You should never forget your warm-up. A TABATA workout is 20 seconds of 2-arm Kettle-bell swings, 10 seconds rest, 20 seconds push-ups, and 10 seconds rest. You should do those 4 rounds. That's it. I was done in a total time of 8 minutes by the time and when I got to school my heart was still pumping pretty hard.
A healthy body is needed for studying and working, and efficiency   is the key to building a great body in the least amount   of time possible and you can't get more efficient than a 4-minute workout.

Context: Federal regulators Wednesday approved a plan to create a nationwide emergence alert system using text messages delivered to cell phones.
Text messages have exploded in popularity in recent years, particularly among young people. The wireless industry's trade association, CTIA, estimates more than 48 billion text messages are sent each month.
The plan comes from the Warning Alert and Response Network Act, a 2006 federal law that requires improvements to the nation's emergency alert system. The act tasked the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with coming up with new ways to alert the public about emergencies.
""The ability to deliver accurate and timely warnings and alerts through cell phones and other mobile services is an important next step in our efforts to help ensure that the American public has the information they need to take action to protect themselves and their families before, and during, disasters and other emergencies,"" FCC Chairman Kevin Martin said following approval of the plan.
Participation in the alert system by carriers--telecommunications companies is voluntary, but it has received solid support from the wireless industry.
The program would be optional for cell phone users. They also may not be charged for receiving alerts.
There would be three different types of messages, according to the rules.
The first would be a national alert from the president, likely involving a terrorist attack or natural disaster. The second would involve ""approaching threats,"" which could include natural disasters like hurricanes or storms or even university shootings. The third would be reserved for child abduction   emergencies, or so-called Amber Alerts.
The service could be in place by 2014. 
 Question:What is the purpose of the approved plan? 
A. To warn people of emergencies via messages. 
B. To popularize the use of cell phones. 
C. To estimate the monthly number of messages. 
D. To promote the wireless industry. 
 Answer: A
Context: Katy Johnson hit her forehead into a tree branch while walking and texting on her cell phone a couple of weeks ago.
""I'm pretty sure I was replying to two texts at a time,"" the 18-year-old girl said, recalling one text was from her dad and one from a friend.
""I was just so devoted to the texts that I just walked right into it.""
There appear to be a growing number of serious injuries that occur when people use their cell phones to send text messages while also doing something else, such as walking. Bill Haselow, an emergency physician, said the risks are real. He treated two serious texting-while-walking injuries at the Mequon hospital in the past few months. Both teens suffered a broken nose after falling face first on a sidewalk.
If you're over 25 or so, it might be hard to appreciate the popularity of exchanging word messages that you compose and read on the screen of your cell phone. But there's no doubt they have an attraction.
Perez, a new college graduate, said the number of text messages she sends and receives easily exceeds the number of calls she makes and receives on her cell. Perez said her bills show she typically sends 3,000 texts per month, or an average of 100 per day.www.ks5u.com
Perez said she favors texting because it's less formal than calling someone and because it's easier to communicate while doing another activity -- although she is aware now that texting and walking aren't always easy to do together.
""I only talk on the phone if I really have to,"" Perez said.
The popularity of cell phones has led to efforts to limit their use. Illinois is considering a ban on walkers using wireless devices while crossing streets. And Wisconsin passed a bill to forbid text messaging by drivers.
But don't expect laws to change addiction -- er, habits. 
 Question:It can be inferred from the passage that   _  . 
A. Katy was reading two messages when she ran into a tree 
B. Perez makes more calls than sending messages on cell phones 
C. emergency physicians don't allow drivers to text while they are driving 
D. sending messages on the phone is attractive to both teenagers and youths 
 Answer: D
Context: People should be warned against using mobile phones outdoors in stormy weather because they may""be struck by lightning"",according to doctors.
Three experts have described how a teenage girl was struck by lightning while using her phone in a large London park.The girl,aged 15,recovered,but a year later was still wheelchair-bound and found to be suffering complex physical and emotional problems.
The girl also had a perforate eardrum on the side where she had been holding the mobile phone.She was having general recovery in Northwick Park Hospital,Middlesex.
Swinda Esprit,a senior house officer, said that while the brain and muscle damage was similar to that of many lightning victims--who can experience heart attacks on being struck--the ear problems were not.
She said that the damages were particularly relevant for people who might be involved in less serious lightning incidents,who might otherwise recover, but would never get their full hearing back if struck while on the phone.
""We were shocked by the damage,which is why we wanted to draw attention to it,""Dr Esprit said.""A year on and she still was suffering these difficult hearing.""
They added that three other cases had been reported in newspapers in China,South Korea,and Malaysia.In the Malaysian case,a sales executive was killed by lightning while talking on his phone during a thunderstorm near Kuala Lumpur.
""All these events resulted in death,""the doctors wrote.""This rare phenomenon is a public health issue,and education is necessary to stress the risk.""
The Australian Lightning Protection Standard recommends that metallic objects,including cordless or mobile phones,should not be carried outdoors during thunderstorms.However, ""the United States National Weather Service says on its website that both are safe to use ""because there is no direct path between you and the lightening"".
Paul Taylor, of ""the Met Office'',said the ear injuries were a consequence of mobile phones being metal,and not related to radio waves.
Mr. Taylor said that mobile phones should be treated as another piece of metal,similar to carrying coins or wearing rings,and people need to be warned against the possible danger. 
 Question:The purpose in writing this passage is  _  . 
A. to draw attention to the risk of using mobile phones in lightening 
B. to focus on various damages done to lightning victims 
C. to tell us the news that a teenage girl was struck by lightning 
D. to stress the danger of making phone calls in lightning 
 Answer: A
Context: We discuss the issue of when to help a patient die. Doctors of our generation are not newcomers to this question. Going back to my internship days, I can remember many patients in pain, sometimes in coma , with late, hopeless cancer. For many of them, we wrote an order for heavy medication--morphine by the clock. This was not talked about openly and little was written about it. It was essential, not controversial.
The best way to bring the problem into focus is to describe two patients whom I cared for. The first, formerly a nurse, had an automobile accident. A few days later her lungs seemed to fill up; her heart developed dangerous rhythm disturbances. So there she was: in coma, on a breathing machine, her heartbeat maintained with an electrical device. One day after rounds, my secretary said the husband and son of the patient wanted to see me. They told me their wife and mother was obviously going to die; she was a nurse and had told her family that she never wanted this kind of terrible death, being maintained by machines. I told them that while I respected their view, there was nothing deadly about her situation. The kidney  failure she had was just the kind for which the artificial kidney was most effective. While possibly a bit reassured, they were disappointed. Here was the head surgeon seemingly determined to keep everybody alive, no matter what.
Within a few days the patient's pacemaker  could be removed and she awoke from her coma. About six months later, the door of my office opened and in walked a gloriously fit woman. After some cheery words of appreciation, the father and son asked to speak to me alone. As soon as the door closed, both men became quite tearful. All that came out was, ""We want you to know how wrong we were.""
The second patient was an 85-year-old lady whose hair caught fire while she was smoking. She arrived with a deep burn; I knew it would surely be deadly. As a remarkable coincidence there was a meeting for discussion going on at the time in medical ethics . The speaker asked me if I had any sort of ethical problem I could bring up for discussion. I described the case and asked the students their opinion. After the discussion, I made a remark that was, when looking back, a serious mistake. I said, ""I'll take the word back to the nurses about her and we will talk about it some more before we decide."" The instructor and the students were shocked: ""You mean this is a real patient?"" The teacher of ethics was not accustomed to being challenged by actuality. In any event, I went back and met with the nurses. A day or two later, when she was making no progress and was suffering terribly, we began to back off treatment. Soon she died quietly and not in pain. As a reasonable physician, you had better move ahead and do what you would want done for you. And don't discuss it with the world first. There is a lesson here for everybody. Assisting people to leave this life requires strong judgment and long experience to avoid its misuse. 
 Question:The author suggested that doctors  _   before they assist a patient in killing himself. 
A. do what they are wanted to do 
B. discuss with the others about the decision first 
C. be required to do so first by the patient

Context: Since ancient times, people have known about its ability to reduce pain and high body temperature. More than 2000 years ago, the Greek doctor Hippocrates advised his patients to chew on the bark and leaves of the willow.
The tree contains a chemical called salicin . From salicin, researchers in the 1800s discovered how to make salicylic acid . And in 1897, a chemist named Felix Hoffmann at Friedrich Bayer and Company in Germany created acetyl salicylic acid. Later it became the active substance in a new medicine that Bayer called aspirin. The ""a"" came from acetyl. The ""spir"" came from the spirea plant, which also produces salicin. And the ""in"" Well, that is a common way to end medicine names.
In 1982, a British scientist shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in part for discovering how aspirin works. Sir John Vane found that aspirin blocks the body from making natural substances called prostaglandins .Prostaglandins have several effects on the body. Some cause pain and the expansion, or swelling( ; ), of damaged tissue. Others protect the lining of the stomach and small intestine. Prostaglandins also make the heart, kidneys and blood vessels  work well. But there is a problem. Aspirin works against all prostaglandins, good and bad. Scientists learned how aspirin interferes with an enzyme . One form of this enzyme makes the prostaglandin that causes pain and swelling. Another form of the enzyme creates a protective effect. So aspirin can reduce pain and swelling in damaged tissues. But it can also harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine . 
 Question:What can we know about aspirin according to the passage? 
A. Aspirin can treat almost diseases. 
B. Aspirin can create the protective enzyme. 
C. Aspirin can harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
D. Aspirin can protect the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
 Answer: C
Context: For decades, public health officials have puzzled over a surprising fact about HIV: Only about 10-20 percent of infants who are breastfed by infected mothers catch the virus. Tests show, though, that HIV is indeed present in breast milk, so these children are exposed to the virus multiple times daily for the first several months of their lives.
Now, a group of scientists and doctors from Duke University has figured out why these babies don't get infected. Human breast milk naturally contains a protein called Tenascin C that neutralizes HIV and, in most cases, prevents it from being passed from mother to child. Eventually, they say, the protein could potentially be valuable as an HIV-fighting tool for both infants and adults that are either HIV-positive or at risk of contracting the infection.
The research, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was inspired by previous work by other researchers showing that, both in tissue cultures   and live mice, breast milk from HIV-negativemothers was naturally endowed with HIV-fighting properties. Scientists suggested that a few different proteins in the milk could potentially be responsible, but no one knew which one.
As part of the study, the researchers divided breast milk into smaller fractions   made up of specific proteins via a number of filters   -- separating the proteins by size, electrical charge and other characteristics--and tested which of these fractions, when added to a tissue culture, prevented the cells from being infected by HIV. Eventually, they found that one particular protein was present in all the HIV-resistant fractions but in none of the others: Tenascin C.
Tenascin C works by blocking a key protein on HIV's envelope that normally ties up to a receptor on a T cell's membrane called CCR5. In doing so, Tenascin C prevents HIV from mixing with the T cell and injecting its RNA inside.
Still, the researchers say that other natural elements in milk might play a role in fighting HIV as well. ""It's clearly not the whole story, because we do have samples that have low amounts of this protein but still have HIV-neutralizing activity,"" the study's lead author Permar says. ""So it may be acting in concert with other antiviral and antimicrobial factors in the milk.""
Whatever those other factors are, though, the finding vindicates (......) recent changes to UN guidelines that recommend even HIV-positive mothers in resource-poor countries should breastfeed, if they're taking anti-retroviral drugs to combat their own infection.
The next steps, Permar says, are determining which area of Tenascin C is active and whether it can effectively prevent transmission in a live animal. If it works, it could potentially be incorporated   into an HIV drug with broader applications. It's even possible that it could someday be adapted to reduce the risk of HIV transmission in adults as well as infants. 
 Question:Which of the following about Tenascin C is true? 
A. It has become an effective tool in fighting HIV. 
B. It was first found by Permar and her research group. 
C. It can prevent transmission in a live animal effectively. 
D. It can sometimes prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. 
 Answer: D
Context: There are some strong-minded people that are able to stop smoking today and be free from the addiction the next day. However, some smokers may have to seek help from medication   in order to kick the habit.
     What medication actually does is to reduce the wish to smoke. Some of the medication must be taken with a doctor's guidance. The five most common medications to stop smoking are Bupropion SR, nicotine gum, nicotine inhalers, nicotine nasal spray and nicotine patches. People can buy nicotine gum and nicotine patches in chemists. However, the other medications require a prescription.
     Zyban tablets have been found to be highly effective in curing people of smoking addiction. The tablet needs to be taken whole, without crushing  it, as crushing can lead to side effects. It can be bought on the prescription of a doctor.
     Nicotine patches are filled with nicotine and they are applied to the skin. The skin takes in the nicotine and carries it to the blood stream. The amount of nicotine in these patches is quite limited, not enough to lead to addiction. But you shouldn't take them for dinner. In fact, millions of people have benefited from these nicotine patches.
     Nicotine gum is supposed to be a safer choice. It is used in such a way that it comes into contact with the blood vessels   in the mouth and then releases the nicotine. The nicotine should not go through the stomach; otherwise, it may cause certain side effects.
     These different types of medications have to be taken quite carefully. Do ask your doctor before taking any of these. 
 Question:Medication can   _  . 
A. weaken smokers' wish to smoke 
B. clear away the nicotine in smokers' bodies 
C. only be taken on the prescription of a doctor 
D. stop people from becoming addicted to smoking

Context: OTTAWA -- Canada's western city of Calgary is the world's best city when it comes to healthy living, local press reported Monday.
According to an international survey by Mercer Human Resource Consulting, a London-based consulting firm, Calgary was put at the top of a list of 144 cities. It scored 121 points, just above Honolulu's score of 120. Helsinki(,) and Ottawa followed at 119.5 and 118.5 respectively.
Three other Canadian cities came in the top 20. Montreal and Vancouver tied for ninth and Toronto came in at 18th.

Context: A new factory that turns used wine bottles into green sand could revolutionize the recycling industry and help to filter  the nation's drinking water.
For the last 100 years special high grade white sand quarried  at Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire has been used to filter tap water to remove bacteria and impurities--but this may no longer be necessary.
The green sand has already been successfully tested by water companies and is being used in 50 swimming pools in Scotland to keep the water clean.
 _ by one million pounds from the European Union and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs(Defar), a company based in Scotland is building a factory to turn beverage bottles back into the sand from which they were made.
The idea is not only to avoid using up increasingly scarce sand in Scotland and avoid any further quarrying but also to solve a crisis in the recycles only 750 000 tones of it.
Howard Dryden, the scientist and managing director of the company has spent six years working on what he calls Active Filtration Meadia, or AFM, the recycled glass. He says he needs bottles that have already contained drinkable liquids to be sure that drinking water would not be polluted.
""The fact is that tests show that AFM does the job better than glass, it is easier to clean and reuse and has all sorts of properties that make it ideal for other applications, ""he claimed. He also thinks the market will be able to take 250 000 tones of green sand a year. The plan is to build five or six factories in cites in UK where the bottles come from to cut down on transport.
The factory will be completed this month and is expected to go into full production on January 14 next year. Once it is providing a ""regular"" product, the government's drinking water inspectorate will be asked to perform tests and approve it for general use by water companies. 
 Question:According to the passage, the new idea can do the following except   _  . 
A. cutting down the cost on transport 
B. avoiding using up increasingly scarce sand 
C. avoiding further quarrying of white sand 
D. solving the crisis in the recycling industry

Context: It will be hot--hot enough that most locals will have cleared town for cooler places. But because athletes competing at the 2004 Olympics have no choice but to stay in the hot weather, many plan to turn to science to stay cool.
Some will put their hands in ice water just before competing and nearly all will be wearing fabrics  designed with hot weather in mind.
""Normally we warm up before exercise,""said Gordon Sleivert, director of sports science and medicine at the Canadian Sport Center in Victoria, British Columbia.""But in this case we're taking the warm out of warm up. It's like pre-cooling.""
Experts are predicting  the average high this August in Athens will be 90 degrees Fahrenheit, with temperatures often reaching above 100(the average temperature in Sydney for the 2000 summer games was 64).
Although some events, such as the marathon, will start early(1 a.m.) to avoid hot weather, _        Drinking lots of water will help athletes keep cool, but humidity  remains a problem. The body's ability to cool down is weakened by damp air since sweat drips off the skin rather than evaporates ,resulting in dehydration  without the cooling.
""Getting hot is a real problem because when our brains heats up, the brain waves are more like when you're really sleepy. Everything feels harder,"" said Sleivert. 
 Question:The passage mainly tells us that   _  . 
A. why it is very hot in Athens 
B. the hot weather is a big problem for Olympic athletes 
C. how important science is to every athlete 
D. the Olympics will be put off because of the hot weather 
 Answer: B
Context: If you want to cook something quickly, you heat it from both sides. That's what's happening to the West Antarctic ice sheet . A new study reveals that the area under the ice sheet is far hotter than previously thought, fed by an unexpected flow of geothermal energy . While the CO2we send out heats the atmosphere above the continent, earth is melting us ice from below.
If you were to drill   deep at some place on the continents, you would find that the temperature increases about 25degC for every kilometer deep into the hole on average. Scientists call this the geothermal gradient . Until recently, no one had drilled deeply enough through the West Antarctic ice to determine the geothermal gradient underground. For the new study, researchers drilled all the way through the ice and into the mud. They found that the geothermal gradient was about 200degC, which is several times the global average on continents. Few predicted this result, although it had been showed that the earth below the West Antarctic ice is unusually hot.
Even with the new discovery, though, we still don't know exactly where the heat is coming from. One interesting possibility is volcanoes, which are under the ice. As recently as 2013, scientists were still discovering volcanoes under the ice in the area, and there may be many more.
Some people say that these volcanoes, rather than manmade climate change, are responsible for melting the area's ice. While it's true that heat coming from within the earth, including heat related to volcanoes, makes the melting faster, it is just one contributor to the loss of the West Antarctic ice sheet---not the main cause. Today's study could help us understand how the whole system, including global warming, is melting the ice.

Context: The World Health Organization (WHO) planned to study the relationship between the eating habits of the people and the disease. Two doctors were chosen to make the study. They flew to Africa south of the Sahara and during the next two months visited ten countries. They found that serious diseases of poor eating, often mistaken for other diseases, existed in all parts of Africa. The diseases were similar and could therefore all be named kwashiorkor. The diseased children are usually from one to four years old. As the illness progresses, the child's stomach becomes swollen by liquid collecting in the body. The skin changes color and may break out in open sores . The hair changes color and starts to fall out. The patient loses all interest in his surroundings and even in food, and becomes so weak that he wants to lie down all the time. Stomach liquids are no longer produced.
The doctors reasoned that kwashiorkor was found in the young children of this age in many parts of Africa because of lack of milk or meat. Their mothers, after stopping their breastfeeding, gave them foods full of starches instead of greatly needed proteins. They found that the addition of milk to the food of the children suffering from kwashiorkor saved many lives.
The unbelievable thing about kwashiorkor is that the very existence of the disease--which has been killing thousands of children for centuries--was not even recognized in Latin America as recently as ten years ago. The deaths of those children were mistakenly listed as due to other diseases. It was the WHO's work in Africa that led to the discovery of the problem in Central America. 
 Question:It is difficult to discover kwashiorkor because   _   . 
A. it has no symptoms at all 
B. it is hard to identify signs of it 
C. it doesn't last long enough for careful observation 
D. it is hardly different from other diseases

Context: My parents have certainly had their troubles, and as their child I'll never know how they made it to 38 years of marriage. They loved each other, but they didn't seem to like each other very much. Dad was too fond of his beer, and he talked down to Mom a lot. When she tried to stand up to him, a fight would unavoidably follow.
It was my dad's disease that began to change things. The year 1998 was the beginning of a remarkable transformation for my family. My father, Jim Dineen, the always healthy, weightlifting, never-missed-a-day-of-work kind of dad, discovered he had kidney  disease.
The decision to go ahead with a transplant for my father was a long and tough one, mostly because he had liver damage too. One physician's assistant told him, ""According to your file, you're supposed to be dead."" And for a while, doctors mistakenly thought that he would need not just a kidney transplant, but a liver transplant too. _ 
When the donor testing process finally began in the spring of 2003, numerous people, including me, my uncle Tom, and my mom, came back as matches of varying degree. But Mom was the one who insisted on going further. She decided to donate a kidney to my father. She said she was not scared, and it was the right thing to do. We all stepped back in amazement.
At last a date was chosen - November 11, 2003. All of a sudden, the only thing that seemed to matter Dad was telling the world what a wonderful thing Mom was doing for him. A month before the surgery, he sent her birthday flowers with a note that read, ""I love you and I love your kidney! Thank you!""
Financially, the disease was upsetting to them. So my sister and I were humbled and surprised when, shortly before his surgery day, Dad handed us a diamond jewelry that we were to give to Mom after the operation. He'd accumulated his spare dollars to buy it.
At the hospital on the day of the transplant, all our relatives and friends gathered in the waiting room and became involved in a mean euchre   tournament. My family has always handled things with a lot of laughter, and even though we were all tense, everybody was taking bets on how long this ""change of conduct"" would last in my parents.
We would inform Dad that if he chose to act like a real pain on any particular day after the operation, he wasn't allowed to blame it on PMS just because he'd now have a female kidney.
The surgeries went well, and not long afterward, my sister and I were allowed to go in to visit. Dad was in a great deal of pain but again, all he could talk about was Mom. Was she okay? How was she feeling? Then the nurses let us do something unconventional. As they were wheeling Mom out of recovery room, they rolled her into a separate position to visit Dad. It was strange to see both my parents hooked up to IVs and machines and trying to talk to each other through tears. The nurses allowed us to present the diamond jewelry to Mom so that Dad could watch her open it. Everyone was crying, even the nurses.
As I stood with digital camera in hand, I tried to keep the presence of mind to document the moment. My dad was having a hard time fighting back emotion, and suddenly my parents unexpectedly reached out to hold each other's hands.
In my nearly 35 years of existence, I'd never seen my parents do that, and I was spellbound. I snapped a picture and later rushed home to make sure I'd captured that enormous, life-defining moment. After so many years of disagreement, it was apparent to me that they finally understood how much each loved the other. 
 Question:What's the best title for the passage? 
A. Dad's disease 
B. Mom's decision 
C. The Gift of Life

Context: A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations.
Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital.
Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. ""We were desperate,"" said Matouk.
The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. ""We are very satisfied with the results,"" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital.
Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians in transplant surgery at the Royal Liverpool. ""Funding is a problem,"" said Hammad. ""In the meantime we'll go back as volunteers to Gaza for the next couple of years to do more transplants."" The Liverpool team's next visit is scheduled for May. 
 Question:What is the beginning of the cooperation between the Royal Liverpool hospital and Gaza? 
A. A UK doctor contacted Gaza hospital. 
B. The Shifa imported medical machines from UK. 
C. Ziad Matouk's condition seemed to get worse. 
D. A Shifa doctor turned to Royal Liverpool hospital for help.

Context: It is a matter of common observation that although money income keeps going up over the years, we never seem to become richer. Prices are rising continuously. This condition is what we call inflation: the money supply is becoming inflated so that each unit of it becomes less valuable. We have got used to higher and higher rates of inflation in recent years. What could be bought twenty years ago for one pound now costs well over 2 pounds. And at present this rate of inflation seems to be rising rather than falling. If in the real world our money incomes go up at the same rate as prices do. One might think that inflation doesn't matter. _ When money is losing value it also loses one of the qualities of a good money--stability of value. It is no longer acceptable as a store of value; and it becomes an unsuitable means of delayed payment. Nobody wants to hold a wasting possession, so people try to get rid of money as quickly as possible. Inflation therefore simply stimulates our spending and discourages saving. 
 Question:.We can conclude according to the passage that   _  . 
A. the writer is a government official 
B. the writer is worried about inflation 
C. the writer encourages people to spend money 
D. the writer has become richer because of inflation

Context: Thick dust rose and a large building collapsed. This was the scene in Zhu Zhou,Hunan Province on May 17. Nine people were killed and 16 injured.
Things were similar in the Sichuan earthquake. Thousands of people were buried in the ruins and lost their lives. What if we could have warned them?
People are always _ to find a way of preventing buildings' collapse. Better materials and technology help,but they are not a solution.
Just like humans,a building has its own life cycle from ""birth"" to ""death"".If we know when a building is going to collapse,we can repair it in advance or get out of it before it falls. Now,scientists at the University of Illinois have developed a material that turns red before it breaks. The invention could be used in things like climbing ropes or bridge supports. The research was led by Nancy Sottos,a professor at the university's Beckman Institute,and Douglas Davis,a graduate research assistant.
The secret behind the color--changing material is a type of molecule  .A molecule is a group of atoms held together by chemical bonds. Imagine you and your friends standing in a circle,holding hands. Each person stands for one atom,your hands represent the bonds,and the entire circle represents a molecule. If one person lets go of his or her hands,the molecule changes color. The research team put the molecule into a soft material. When the researchers stretched the material,it turned bright red for a few seconds before it broke into two pieces. When they repeatedly stretched and relaxed the material,without breaking it,it only turned a little red.
The major problem is that light can get rid of the red color. When the team shone bright light on the molecule,the broken bond was fixed,and the color disappeared. Scientists have yet to do more research before the color--changing molecules can be used outside the lab. 
 Question:Which of the following is a WRONG statement? 
A. Thousands of people died from the collapse of buildings in the Sichuan earthquake because they hadn't been warned. 
B. There is no building that will never collapse. 
C. A new material has been applied to buildings to warn people of collapse. 
D. A color--changing material can turn red before it breaks.

Context: French doctors and American scientists have reported doing an operation in which the doctor was outside the operating room. This kind of operation is known as robotic operation.
Doctor Marescaux did the operation in an office in New York City last month, while a sixty-eight-year-old woman patient was in a hospital in Strasbourg, France.
A doctor in Strasbourg got the patient ready. He placed medical tools and a small video camera in her stomach area. Doctor Marescaux in New York watched the patient on a video screen. Then he used the computer to send messages to the robot machine. The robot moved the tools that cut the woman's gallbladder away. The woman got well soon after the operation and left the hospital two days later.
Experts say the main problem with such a robotic operation is based on high-speed telecommunications between the doctor and the robot. Technology must be able to send a doctor's order to a robot to move the tools quickly.
Experts also say a successful robotic operation will improve an operation. For example, the robot can make much smaller movements than a person can. A robot machine can turn tools in ways that a doctor's hand cannot.
Doctors say such a robotic operation will make possible safer and better operations in the future. They say it will improve doctor training. It will also mean that doctors could do an operation on people in dangerous places far away. And it could mean that people could have operations done by top doctors without having to travel to the city where doctors work. 
 Question:We use the robot in the operation because   _  . 
A. it can send messages at a high speed 
B. even a top doctor can't do the operation himself 
C. it can make the operation safer and better 
D. operations can be done without any doctors 
 Answer: C
Context: French doctors and American scientists have reported doing an operation in which the doctor was outside the operating room. This kind of operation is known as robotic operation.
Doctor Marescaux did the operation in an office in New York City last month, while a sixty-eight-year-old woman patient was in a hospital in Strasbourg, France.
A doctor in Strasbourg got the patient ready. He placed medical tools and a small video camera in her stomach area. Doctor Marescaux in New York watched the patient on a video screen. Then he used the computer to send messages to the robot machine. The robot moved the tools that cut the woman's gallbladder away. The woman got well soon after the operation and left the hospital two days later.
Experts say the main problem with such a robotic operation is based on high-speed telecommunications between the doctor and the robot. Technology must be able to send a doctor's order to a robot to move the tools quickly.
Experts also say a successful robotic operation will improve an operation. For example, the robot can make much smaller movements than a person can. A robot machine can turn tools in ways that a doctor's hand cannot.
Doctors say such a robotic operation will make possible safer and better operations in the future. They say it will improve doctor training. It will also mean that doctors could do an operation on people in dangerous places far away. And it could mean that people could have operations done by top doctors without having to travel to the city where doctors work. 
 Question:If the smaller movement can't be done by doctors in the operation, we may use   _   to solve it. 
A. more tools 
B. a robot machine 
C. a video camera 
D. telecommunications 
 Answer: B
Context: Fat on human body is distributed   in two different ways. Some fat people have a large chest and no waistline  , looking rather like apples. Others are fatter below the waist,  looking more like pears.
      Doctors in Cambridge, England have been examining the relationship between health and fat  distribution. They find that the pear-shaped fat people have fewer problems than the apple-shaped  people. What seems to be most important is not just how much fat you have but where you have it. The doctors measured the apple-shaped women and pear-shaped women and examined them  with X-ray scanners (X). Human beings have two types of fat, one is outside fat that is the fat below the skin and the other is inside fat that lies inside the body. Using the X-ray scanners, the doctors found that the ""apples"" have a large amount of inside fat. If this inside fat is  much more than outside fat, it will probably cause health problems such as obesity  . The best treatment for obesity is to reduce the inside fat. But unfortunately diet treatment  simply makes an apple-shaped person into a smaller apple and a pear-shaped person into a smaller pear. At the moment there is no effective way of reducing the inside fat. 
 Question:The basic reason why some people suffer from obesity is that 
A. they take very little exercise every day 
B. they eat too much 
C. they are examined by X-ray scanners quite often 
D. they have much more inside fat 
 Answer: D
Context: A blocked airway  can kill someone in three to four minutes, but it can take more than eight minutes for an ambulance to arrive. So a simple procedure such as opening someone's airway can save their life while they're waiting for emergency medical help. This means you're more likely to give first aid to someone you know than a stranger.
There are many misconceptions  surrounding first aid. Below are the 'most popular' ones with details of what you should do.
You should put butter or cream on a burn. The only thing you should put on a burn is cold water - keep the butter for cooking. Put the affected area under cold running water for at least ten minutes.
The best way to treat bleeding is to put the wound under a tap. If you put a bleeding wound under a tap you wash away the body's clotting agents  and make it bleed more. Instead put pressure on the wound with whatever is available to stop or slow down the flow of blood. As soon as possible call 999. Keep pressure on the wound until help arrives.
Nosebleeds are best treated by putting the head back. If you put the head back during a nosebleed, all the blood goes down the back of the airway. Instead advise them to tilt  their head forwards and ask the person to pinch  the end of their nose and breathe through their mouth.
You need lots of training to do first aid. You don't - what you mostly need is common sense. You can learn enough first aid in a few minutes to save someone's life - whether it's from a book, attending a course or watching videos online.
Remember: anyone can save a life

Context: Forget chip fat, sugar cane or rapeseed oil -- the latest source of biofuel could be watermelons. Scientists have discovered that the fruit is a great source of sugar that can be readily distilled   into alcohol to power cars and farm machinery.
And sellers reject 360,000 tons of ""substandard"" fruit every year in America alone which could be used as an economical way to make fuel. The waste from US growers could produce nearly two million gallons (nine million litres) of biofuel per year.
In the study, researchers at the United States Department of Agriculture set out to determine the biofuel potential of juice from rejected watermelons --those not sold due to
imperfections, and currently ploughed back into the field. About a fifth of each yearly watermelon crop is left in the field because of surface blemishes   or because they are misshapen.
Dr. Wayne Fish, who led the team, found that 50 percent of the fruit was fermentable   into alcohol which could provide valuable fuel.
""We've shown that the juice of these watermelons is a source of readily fermentable sugars, representing an unexploited raw material for alcohol biofuel production,"" he said.
The study, published in the journal Biotechnology for Biofuels, discovered that watermelons could produce around 20 gallons of fuel per acre from fruit that otherwise would go to waste.
Production of biofuels has been targeted by Western governments as a way to support renewable energy targets.
The European Union has a target for 2010 that 5.75 percent of transport fuels should come from biological sources, but the target is unlikely to be met.
The British government's Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation requires five percent of the fuel sold at the pump by 2010 to be biofuel. 
 Question:It can be learned from the text that    _   . 
A. about two gallons of fuel could be made from rejected fruit per acre 
B. sellers in the world throw away 360,000 tons of watermelons every year 
C. half of the watermelons were fermentable into alcohol to provide energy 
D. five percent of fuel is required to be biofuel from watermelons by 2010 in Britain

Context: In South America, the rich soil of the Amazon River basin in Brazil is known as ""black gold"". Scientists found that the secret of this rich soil was charcoal . Local people made it from animal bones and tree branches. They mixed the charcoal with the soil about 1.500 years ago.
Now, scientists in the United States have done a modern demonstration. They say charcoal fertilization offers a revolutionary way to improve soil quality for hundreds or even thousands of years.
Mingxin Guo and his team at Delavare State University heated tree leaves, corn stalks , small pieces of wood and poultry waste into ""biochar"" . They reported their findings at a recent meeting of the American Chemical Society in New Orleans.
Biochar could be good news for farmers with poor soil and hungry populations to feed. Professor Guo says it could even help against global warming. Intensive  farming and overuse of chemical fertilizer give out carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Biochar does the opposite, he says. It traps carbon in the ground.
The researchers planted winter wheat in containers of soil in a greenhouse -- some with biochar, some without. Professor Guo says the wheat grows much better in the pots with biochar. The soil was added two percent charcoal to. But he says even a one percent treatment will increase productivity.
The results demonstrated that biochar can increase organic matter in soil. Loss of nutrients in soil is an increasing problem worldwide as farmers try to grow more food for growing populations.
Next, the team will carry out a five-year study of biochar with spinach , green peppers and tomatoes.
Mingxin Guo says he learns about the ""black gold"" in Brazil from a magazine story. He explains that it was discovered in the jungle, in the area where waters flow to the Amazon, in the 1960's. But it was not until recent years that scientists began to bring public attention to it. 
 Question:According to the research, the biochar can help against global warming because it can   _  . 
A. reduce the carbon dioxide 
B. keep the carbon in the soil 
C. reduce the loss of nutrients in the soil 
D. absorb the carbon dioxide 
 Answer: B
Context: Australian scientists are trying to give kangaroo-style stomachs to cattle and sheep in order to cut the greenhouse gases they send out, which is thought to be responsible for global warming. 
  Thanks to special bacteria in their stomachs, kangaroo flatulence contains nomethane  and scientists want to transfer that bacteria to cattle and sheep who produce large quantities of the harmful gas. 
  While the usual image of greenhouse gas pollution is a billowing smokestack pushing out carbon dioxide, farm animals' passing wind contributes a surprisingly high percentage of total emissions in some countries. 
  ""Fourteen percent of emissions from all sources in Australia is from enteric  methane from cattle and sheep,"" said Athol Klieve, a senior research scientist with the Queensland state government. 
 ""And if you look at another country such as New Zealand, which has got a much higher agricultural base, they're actually up around 50 percent,"" he said. 
  Researchers say the bacteria also make the digestive process much more efficient and could potentially save millions of dollars in feed costs for farmers. 
 But it will take researchers at least three years to isolate the bacteria, before they can even start to develop a way of transferring it to cattle and sheep. 
 Another group of scientists, meanwhile, has suggested Australians should farm fewer cattle and sheep and just eat more kangaroos. And about 20 percent of health-conscious Australians have eaten the national symbol already. 
 ""It's low in fat, it's got high protein levels and it's very clean in the sense that basically it's the free-range animal,"" said Peter Ampt of the University of New South Wales's institute
of environmental studies. 
 Question:Scientists intend to put the bacteria into cattle and sheep   _  . 
A. to prevent them from sending out greenhouse gases 
B. to help Australian farmers to earn more money 
C. so that they can protect Australian ecosystem 
D. so that they can make full use of special bacteria

 Answer: A
Context: Sometimes successful health campaigns can have quite unexpected reactions. The years of warnings about skin cancer mean that Britons are happy to cover themselves in sunscreen or stay out of the sun altogether, but it also means that most of us are not getting enough vitamin D.
Scientists announced yesterday that Britons need to increase to three times the amount of vitamin D they get per day. They called on food producers to fortify their products with more of the vitamin and suggested people should consider taking supplements  to keep levels up. They also suggested getting out in the sun for short periods more often, but they warned against ""sun bingeing"".
The government does not publish official advice on the amount of vitamin D people should take due to a lack of research, says Dr Birgit Teucher of the Institute for Food Research. But in the US, the government recommends 5 micrograms a day. By that count, Dr Birgit Teucher said that around 90% of Britons between 19 and 64 would be lacking in the vitamin because they only took around 3 micrograms a day.
Vitamin D is important for absorption of calcium by the body, which is needed for healthy teeth and bones. A lack of it can lead to serious diseases in both children and adults. The vitamin can be found in some foods but it can also be obtained from chemicals in the skin reacting to sunlight. Dr Barbara Boucher said adults should get 5 to 25 micrograms a day. Shortage of vitamin D may be linked to diseases such as muscle weakness, high blood pressure and rickets .
Dr Birgit Teucher gave several reasons for the lack among Britons. Increasing numbers of office-based jobs mean a lack of exposure to the sun; and the rise of becoming overweight means that vitamin D--which is fat soluble is increasingly stored in body fat, where it cannot be accessed readily.
Professor Brian Wharton of the Institute of Child Health said that children in particular needed to have enough vitamin D to prevent rickets.
Professor Graham Bentham, an environmental scientist at the University of East Anglia, added that babies who were only breast-fed probably need to take supplements in case their mother was vitamin D lacking. Those drinking milk were likely to be OK, thanks to the fortification of the drink.
The scientists called on food producers to fortify milk, bread and breakfast nutrient to enable people to get their daily amount of the vitamin. Prof Graham Bentham added that 30 minutes of sun exposure to the face and forearms between April and October would be _ . Outside these months, the sun is not strong enough in Britain for the body to produce its own vitamin D.
But Prof Graham Bentham warned against spending too long in the sun. ""Sun bingeing is well known to be dangerous,"" he said. ""In any case, vitamin D transformation in the skin switches off after a while so short frequent amounts are better for vitamin D formation.""

Context: More than four decades ago British scientist Robert Edwards first witnessed the miracle of human life growing inside a test tube at his Cambridge lab. Since that ground-breaking moment, more than four million babies have been born through IVF and in 2010 his great contribution to science was finally recognized as he was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine.
The prize for Dr Edwards, who was given a Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Award in 2008, includes a PS900,000 cheque. The Nobel Assembly described IVF as a ""milestone in modern medicine"".
With the help of fellow scientist Patrick Steptoe, the Manchester-born physiologist developed IVF -- leading to the birth of the world's first test tube baby. Dr Steptoe died 10 years later but their work has transformed fertility treatment and given hope to millions of couples.
It was a scientific breakthrough that transformed the lives of millions of couples. They said: ""His achievements have made it possible to treat infertility, a disease which makes human unable to have a baby. This condition has been afflicting a large percentage of mankind including more than 10% of all couples worldwide.""
Louise Brown, the world's first test tube baby, made international headlines when she was born in Oldham, Gtr Manchester, in 1978 to parents Lesley and John who had been fruitlessly trying for a baby since 1969.
Ivf-in-vitro fertilisation is the process whereby egg cells are fertilised outside the body before being implanted in the womb. After a cycle of IVF, the probability of a couple with infertility problems having a baby is one in five -- the same as healthy couples who conceive naturally.
Professor Edwards, who has five daughters and 11 grandchildren, began his research at Cambridge University in 1963, after receiving his PhD in 1955.He once said: ""The most important thing in life is having a child. Nothing is more special than a child."" With the help of fellow scientist Patrick Steptoe, Prof. Edwards founded the Bourn Hall clinic in Cambridge shire, which now treats more than 900 women a year. Each year, more than 30,000 women in Britain now undergo IVF and 11,000 babies are born as a result of the treatment.
But his work attracted widespread criticism from some scientists and the Catholic Church who said it was ""unethical and immoral"".
Martin Johnson, professor of reproductive  sciences at the University of Cambridge, said the award was ""long overdue"". He said: ""We couldn't understand why the Nobel has come so late but he is delighted -- this is the cherry on the cake for him.""
Professor Edwards was too ill to give interviews but a statement released by his family said he was ""thrilled and delighted"". 
 Question:Why did Professor Edwards begin his research on tube baby? 
A. Because he thought it of great significance to have a child in life. 
B. Because the birthrate around the world was unexpectedly low then. 
C. Because a special child did make a difference to an ordinary family. 
D. Because his fellow scientist wanted to give hope to the unlucky couples. 
 Answer: A
Context: Our listener question this week comes from Abdullahi Farah, who wants to know about the life and work of Doctor Benjamin Carson.
Doctor Carson is an internationally recognized doctor at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. He has been the director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at the hospital for twenty-five years. At the age of thirty-three, he became one of the youngest doctors in the United States to hold that position. And he was the first African-American to have that position at Johns Hopkins Hospital.
Ben Carson is known for his work as a brain surgeon for children. For example, in nineteen eighty-seven, he led a team of seventy doctors and nurses in an operation to separate two babies joined at the head. Earlier attempts by other
on other babies had failed. Doctor Carson successfully performed the operation. Both babies were able to survive independently.
Doctor Carson has written four books. His first book, ""Gifted Hands,"" tells the story of his life. Benjamin Carson was born in nineteen fifty-one in Detroit, Michigan.
As a boy, Ben was not a good student. In fact, he was the worst in his class. When his mother learned of his failing grades she asked her sons to read two library books every week. She limited the amount of time they watched television. And she told them to respect every person.
Ben Carson soon became the top student in his class. He went on to study at Yale University, one of the best universities in the country, and later to medical school at the University of Michigan.
Doctor Carson has received many awards and honors. Last year he received the nation's highest civilian honor. Former President George W. Bush presented Benjamin Carson with the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a ceremony at the White House.

Context: Fat on human body is distributed   in two different ways. Some fat people have a large chest and no waistline  , looking rather like apples. Others are fatter below the waist,  looking more like pears.
      Doctors in Cambridge, England have been examining the relationship between health and fat  distribution. They find that the pear-shaped fat people have fewer problems than the apple-shaped  people. What seems to be most important is not just how much fat you have but where you have it. The doctors measured the apple-shaped women and pear-shaped women and examined them  with X-ray scanners (X). Human beings have two types of fat, one is outside fat that is the fat below the skin and the other is inside fat that lies inside the body. Using the X-ray scanners, the doctors found that the ""apples"" have a large amount of inside fat. If this inside fat is  much more than outside fat, it will probably cause health problems such as obesity  . The best treatment for obesity is to reduce the inside fat. But unfortunately diet treatment  simply makes an apple-shaped person into a smaller apple and a pear-shaped person into a smaller pear. At the moment there is no effective way of reducing the inside fat. 
 Question:The basic reason why some people suffer from obesity is that 
A. they take very little exercise every day 
B. they eat too much 
C. they are examined by X-ray scanners quite often 
D. they have much more inside fat

Context: For decades, public health officials have puzzled over a surprising fact about HIV: Only about 10-20 percent of infants who are breastfed by infected mothers catch the virus. Tests show, though, that HIV is indeed present in breast milk, so these children are exposed to the virus multiple times daily for the first several months of their lives.
Now, a group of scientists and doctors from Duke University has figured out why these babies don't get infected. Human breast milk naturally contains a protein called Tenascin C that neutralizes HIV and, in most cases, prevents it from being passed from mother to child. Eventually, they say, the protein could potentially be valuable as an HIV-fighting tool for both infants and adults that are either HIV-positive or at risk of contracting the infection.
The research, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was inspired by previous work by other researchers showing that, both in tissue cultures   and live mice, breast milk from HIV-negativemothers was naturally endowed with HIV-fighting properties. Scientists suggested that a few different proteins in the milk could potentially be responsible, but no one knew which one.
As part of the study, the researchers divided breast milk into smaller fractions   made up of specific proteins via a number of filters   -- separating the proteins by size, electrical charge and other characteristics--and tested which of these fractions, when added to a tissue culture, prevented the cells from being infected by HIV. Eventually, they found that one particular protein was present in all the HIV-resistant fractions but in none of the others: Tenascin C.
Tenascin C works by blocking a key protein on HIV's envelope that normally ties up to a receptor on a T cell's membrane called CCR5. In doing so, Tenascin C prevents HIV from mixing with the T cell and injecting its RNA inside.
Still, the researchers say that other natural elements in milk might play a role in fighting HIV as well. ""It's clearly not the whole story, because we do have samples that have low amounts of this protein but still have HIV-neutralizing activity,"" the study's lead author Permar says. ""So it may be acting in concert with other antiviral and antimicrobial factors in the milk.""
Whatever those other factors are, though, the finding vindicates (......) recent changes to UN guidelines that recommend even HIV-positive mothers in resource-poor countries should breastfeed, if they're taking anti-retroviral drugs to combat their own infection.
The next steps, Permar says, are determining which area of Tenascin C is active and whether it can effectively prevent transmission in a live animal. If it works, it could potentially be incorporated   into an HIV drug with broader applications. It's even possible that it could someday be adapted to reduce the risk of HIV transmission in adults as well as infants. 
 Question:Which of the following about Tenascin C is true? 
A. It has become an effective tool in fighting HIV. 
B. It was first found by Permar and her research group. 
C. It can prevent transmission in a live animal effectively. 
D. It can sometimes prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

Context: If you want to stay young, sit down and have a good think. This is the research finding of a team of Japanese doctors, who say that most of our brains are not getting enough exercise--and as a result, we are aging unnecessarily soon.
Professor Taiju Matsuzawa wanted to find out why otherwise healthy farmers in northern Japan appeared to be losing their ability to think and reason at a relatively early age, and how the process of aging could be slowed down.
With a team of colleagues at Tokyo National University, he set about measuring brain volumes of a thousand people of different ages and varying occupations.
Computer technology enabled the researchers to obtain precise measurements of the volume of the front and side sections of the brain, which relate to intellect   and emotion, and determine the human character. (The rear section of the brain, which controls functions like eating and breathing, does not contract with age, and one can continue living without intellectual or emotional faculties.)
Contraction of front and side parts--as cells die off--was observed in some subjects in their thirties, but it was still not evident in some sixty- and seventy-year-olds.
Matsuzawa concluded from his tests that there is a simple remedy to the contraction normally associated with age--using the head.  The findings show in general terms that contraction of the brain begins sooner in people in the country than in the towns. Those least at risk, says Matsuzawa, are lawyers, followed by university professors and doctors. White collar workers doing routine work in government offices are, however, as likely to have shrinking brains as the farm worker, bus driver and shop assistant.    Matsuzawa's findings show that thinking can prevent the brain from shrinking. Blood must circulate properly in the head to supply the fresh oxygen the brain cells need. ""The best way to maintain good blood circulation is through using the brain,"" he says, ""Think hard and engage in conversation. Don't rely on pocket calculators."" 
 Question:According to the passage, which people seem to age slower than the others? 
A. Lawyers. 
B. Farmers. 
C. Clerks. 
D. Shop assistants.

Context: Since the 1970s, scientists have been searching for ways to connect the brain with computers. Braincomputer interface(BCI) technology could help people with disabilities send commands to machines.
Recently, two scientists, Jose Millan and Michele Tavella from the Federal Polytehnic School in Lausanne, Switzerland, show a small robotic wheelchair directed by a person's thoughts.
In the laboratory, Tavella operated the wheelchair just by thinking about moving his left or right hand. He could even talk as he watched the vehicle and guided it with his thoughts.
""Our brain has billions of body cells . These send signals through the spinal cord  to the body part to give us the ability to move. But spinal cord injuries  or other conditions can prevent these weak electrical signals from reaching the body part."" Tavella says. ""Our system allows disabled people to communicate with outer world and also to control machines.""
The scientists designed a special cap for the user. This head cover picks up the signals from the scalp  and sends them to a computer. The computer finds meanings of the signals and commands the wheelchair with an engine. The wheelchair also has two cameras that tell objects in its path. They help the computer react to commands from the brain.
Prof. Millan , the team leader, says scientists keep improving the computer software that finds meanings of brain signals and turns them into simple commands."" The practical possibilities that BCI technology offers to disabled people can be grouped in two kinds: communication, and controlling objects. One example is this wheelchair.""
He says his team has set two goals. One is testing with real patients, so as to prove that this is a technology they can get advantages from. And the other is sure that they can use the technology for long. 
 Question:The team will test with real patients to  _  . 
A. make money from them 
B. prove the technology useful to them 
C. make them live longer 
D. learn about their physical condition

Context: When most of us look at our hands, we might notice that we need to clean, or stop biting our fingernails, and that's about it. But if you ask a doctor, he can see a whole lot more. Everything from poor diet and stress to serious kidney   problems can be revealed by a glance at your fingernails.
There are about 30 different nail signs that can be associated with medical issues, though may indicate more than one problem, according to Dr.Amy Derick, a clinical instructor of dermatology at Northwestern University.
Here are five of the things a doctor can tell about your health based on your fingernails.
1. People who aren't eating well and lack vitamin or dietary may have thinner than normal nails, which are more likely to break.
2.Horizontal   lines are associated with serious physical stress. They frequently occur in people who have gone through chemotherapy .They can also occur after some illnesses, injuries, or with severe malnourishment .Interestingly, there may be an altitude connection too. They've also been found in people who dove 1,000 feet and others who participated in an Everest exploration.
3. Vertical  lines, however, are generally not such a big deal. Some people are more genetically prone to them than others, but they're commonly associated with aging.
4. When people lack iron, their nails can turn spoon-like. Instead of curving down and covering the finger normally, they 'll start to rise up on the sides and front, like the part of a spoon that holds liquid.
5. Kidney and liver problems can create ""half-and-half nails"", where one part of the nail is white and the other part dark or pink, according to Derick.
Doctors note that because disease diagnosis is complex and some symptoms can be associated with different diseases, you should always see a medical professional if you are concerned about something you notice. 
 Question:Who will have horizontal lines on the nails ? 
A. A cancer patient who has received normal treatment. 
B. Hungry African children suffering from severe malnourishment. 
C. An explorer who had reached Zhangjiajie in Hunan Province. 
D. A patient with serious illness, like kidney and liver problems. 
 Answer: B
Context: Most children have ever heard their parents yell ""sit up straight!"" or ""don't hang your head !"" when they eat dinner. Nowadays, it is also heard around another activity -- video games. Ten-year-old Owaish admits it takes him three to four hours a day to play games on his tablet computer. In addition, he plays for about two hours on the smart phone every day. As a result, he started suffering a serious pain in the neck around June or July. What's worse the pain has spread to the hand and back gradually, which makes his mother Mehzabin become concerned.
The doctors note the number of young children with the chronic pain  in their necks, arms and shoulders is on the increase sharp in recent years . They are not aging, they haven't had an accident, the blood reports are fine, their X-rays are fine, and their MRIs are fine. Facts have proved that the pain is from the poor posture  while they are playing video games on smart phones or other electronic devices. 19-year -old student Nida feels pain in the finger which holds the weight of her smart phone most of the day. Nida almost uses her smart phone 24/7, which means 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or all the time.
Health experts predict there will be not only physical but mental  problems resulting from the overuse of electronic devices. They encourage people to often take breaks and exercise from using computers, smart phones or other devices. Stand up! Stretch  the legs, back, shoulders and arms in all the possible directions. That's the most effective way and maybe the key to solving the problem completely. After all, the medication doesn't help sometimes.

Context: People should go outside and absorb some sunshine to help increase their vitamin D levels, some experts say. Arthritis Research UK. which is a British medical research organization dedicated to curing arthritis  , says vitamin D deficiency can cause bone loss, muscle function problems and, in some cases, rickets   in children.
The government recommends vitamin D supplements   for pregnant women and children aged under five. But on sunny days, a few minutes outdoors should achieve the same results, Arthritis Research UK says.
Figures show that up to a quarter of the population has low levels of vitamin D in their blood and the majority of pregnant women do not take vitamin D supplements. People aged over 65, pregnant and breast-feeding women and children aged six months to five years old are thought to be most at risk.
Vitamin D is essential to help the body absorb calcium   from food. Low levels of vitamin D can result in serious problems.
Alan Silman, the medical director of Arthritis Research UK, said, ""When the days are sunny, go out for a few minutes and expose your face and arms to the sunshine."" But he also had a warning on overexposure. ""Don't allow your skin to go red, and take care not to burn, particularly in strong sunshine and if you have fair or sensitive skin. From June to August, just 15 minutes is generally enough time.""
""In less sunny months,"" Alan Silman added, ""we recommend that people add more vitamin D in their diet by eating more oily fish such as salmon, tuna, and foods rich in vitamin D, such as cereals  .""

Context: Smaller than your fist, your healthy heart just goes on and on. It will beat more than 60 times a minute for 70 years or more. That's something that most of us take for granted. But it's an amazing fact.
60 times a minute for 60 minutes is 3,600 times. What physical thing can most of us do 3,600 times in one hour? Blink? Maybe. Tap our fingers on the desk? No. Jump up and down? Certainly not! But our heart keeps beating, hour after hour. Every day, it pumps almost 2,000 gallons of blood through our blood vessels . It takes you about five years to drink 2,000 gallons of water.
And, unlike your knees or your back, your heart does all this work without ever complaining ! You never know that it's even there. Your heart is such a reliable ""silent partner"" that people forget to care for it. For many, the first indication that their heart isn't working properly is a serious heart illness! Over 650,000 Americans die of some kind of heart disease every year. Cancer kills 560,000, stroke kills 143,000, and accidents kill 118,000 Americans annually.
Like accidental deaths, many heart disease-related deaths can be avoided if people simply follow the advice of the experts. Unfortunately, most people seem to listen to a little voice in their head that says, ""It won't happen to me. "" So these people keep on smoking and drinking. They continue to eat too much meat. And their only ""exercise"" is getting off the sofa to get something out of the fridge. Please follow the following steps to keep your heart healthy.

Context: Several years ago, I had to replace a receptionist for my unit. Before I advertised for the position, I was approached by another manager, and asked ifl would consider a transfer from his staffinstead of opening a new competition. My natural question was to ask who he wanted me to consider and why.
     It appeared from his description of this employee, Maria, that she was having a lot of problems performing her duties, and had difficulties with her boss, and did not appear to respond to any attempts he, the manager, had made to settle the issues. Now, after listening to his explanation, I really had severe doubts. What crossed my mind, after this discussion, was that he wanted me to take a problem off his hands.
     I told him I would think about it and would let him know the next day. As promised, after   thinking more about this potential performance issue, I decided that I would agree to speak with      Maria privately before I made any decision.
     And, what I found out during this interview, left me deep in thought. As it tumed out, the    performance issue appeared to result from working for a boss who never extended a good morning.   greeting, never gave a word of encouragement, and was constantly changing the work load and    routines. The end result was a totally ruined employee who was unconfident, hated to see a new work day start.
     I decided to accept her transfer to my unit. What started out as a shy, withdrawn and frightened employee turned out to be one of the most productive and loyal employee that I had eyer worked with. Maria couldn't do enough and was constantly asking for more and for more responsibility. I was morethan happy to give her what she needed-praise for work well done, respect as a person, and encouragement for doing well in anything she dealt with.
     Sometimes, we are guilty of holding others back from accomplishing or doing, or developing as they should or could. It may be a wise idea that we all look in the mirror, from time to time, to seewhat we are really like. 
 Question:The writer probably believes that a good boss should  _  .

Context: Some people are like homing pigeons; Drop them off anywhere.and they'll find their way around.Other people.through, can't tell holding a map upside down.Are the directionally challenged just bad learners?
Not all of your navigational skills are learned.Research shows that your sense of direction is innate.An innate ability is something you are born with.Your brain has special navigational neurons--head-direction cells, place cells, and grid cells --and they help program your inside compass when you're just a baby.
In 2010.scientists carried out an experiment to study baby rates'    activity in their brains.Although the rats were newborns.the researchers discovered that their head-direction cells(which help them recognize the direction they're facing) were fully grown and developed.The rats.it seemed.were born with a sense of direction.And they hadn't even opened their eyes yet!
Humans.of course, are not rats.But the hippocampus --the brain we use for navigation--is similar in most mammals.If the rat's compass develops this way.then it's likely a human's compass does, too.
If we're born with a sense of direction.then why are some people so good at getting lost? The scientists found that the two other cells---place and grid cells--developed within the first month.Place cells are thought to help us form a map in our mind.while gird cells help us navigate new and unfamiliar places.The two cells work together, and that's where the trouble might be.
People who took part in a 2013 study played a video game that required them to travel quickly between different places.Monitoring their brains.the scientists.According to researcher Michael Kahana, differences in how gird cells work may help explain why some people have a better sense of direction than others. 
 Question:What do we know about our navigational neurons? 
A. Place cells let us know how to read a map 
B. Grid cells help us reach the place we are going to 
C. They help us use a compass when we lose our way 
D. Place and grid cells grow later than head-direction cells 
 Answer: D
Context: A recent experiment held in Japan shows that it is almost impossible for people to walk exactly straight for 60 metres. Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology found 20 healthy men and asked them to walk as straight as possible to a target 60 metres away at normal speed. Each man had to walk on white paper fixed flat to the floor wearing wet colored socks. The footprints revealed that all walked in a winding rather than a straight line. Researchers found that people readjust the direction of walking every few seconds. The amount of the winding differed from _ to subject. This suggests that none of us can walk in a strictly straight line. We walk in a winding way mainly because of a slight structural or functional imbalance of our limbs  . Although we may start walking in a straight line, several steps afterwards we have changed direction.
Eyesight helps us to correct the direction of walking and leads us to the target. Your ears also help you walk. After turning around a lot with your eyes closed, you can hardly stand still, let alone walk straight.
It's all because your ears help you balance. Inside your inner ear there is a structure which contains liquids. On the sides of the organ are many tiny hair-like structures that move around as the liquid flows. When you spin   the liquid inside also spins. The difference is that when you stop, the liquid continues to spin for a while. Dizziness is the result of these nerves in your ear. When you open your eyes, although your eyesight tells you to walk in a straight line, your brain will trust your ears more, thus you walk in a curved line. 
 Question:The experiment held in Japan proved that   _  . 
A. the participants kept readjusting their direction of walking 
B. all the participants had a good sense of direction 
C. the experiment was done in different ways 
D. none of the participants finished the 60 metres 
 Answer: A
Context: The most complex object known to humanity is the human brain -- and not only is it complex, but it is one of the few natural phenomena that science has no consciousness of. To try to replicate   something that is so poorly understood may therefore seem like pride. But you have to start somewhere, and International Business Machines (IBM) and the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), in Switzerland, propose to start by replicating ""in silico"", one of the brain's building blocks.
In a partnership announced, the two organizations said they would be working together to build a simulation   of a structure known as a neo-cortical column on a type of IBM supercomputer that is currently used to study the molecular functioning of genes. If that works, they plan to use more powerful computers to link such simulated columns together into something that mimics  a brain.
In a real brain, a neo-cortical column is a cylindrical element about a third of a millimeter in diameter and three millimeters long. It is these columns, arranged side by side like the cells of a honeycomb, which make up the famous ""grey matter"" that has become shorthand for human intelligence. The Blue Gene/L supercomputer that will be used for the simulation consists of enough independent processors for each to be programmed to mimic an individual nerve cell in a column.
The EPFL's contribution to the Blue Brain Project will be to create a digital description of how the columns behave. The database from its Brain Mind Institute will provide the raw material for the simulation. Biologists and computer scientists will then connect the artificial nerve cells up in a way that mimics nature. They will do so by assigning electrical properties to them, and telling them how to communicate with each other and how they should modify their connections with one another depending on their activity.
That will be no mean feat. Even a single nerve cell is complicated, not least because each one has about 10,000 connections with others. And nerve cells come in great variety--relying, for example, on different chemical transmitters to carry messages across those connections. Eventually, however, a digital representation of an entire column Should occur.
Assuming that the growth of computing power continues to follow Moore's Law, the leader of IBM's side thinks it should be practical to mimic an entire human brain in silico this way in ten to fifteen years. Such an artificial brain would, of course, be a powerful research tool. It would allow neurological experiments that currently take days in a ""web lab"" to be conducted in seconds. The researchers hope that their simulated brain will reveal the secrets of how certain psychiatric and neurological, disorders develop. But that is probably not the real reason for doing it. The most interesting question, surely, is whether such an artificial brain will be intelligent, or conscious, or both.

Context: It is reported that in the near future robots and humans will probably work together to create jazz. A singing robot is being taught to create jazz with human being in a project.
Antonio Chella from Italy is working with a Telenoid robot. To start with, the Telenoid will be trained to _ the movements and simple sounds made by a human singer, and then connect music with different human emotions.
Previous  robots had the ability to find common connections between things. But Chella suggests that a conscious  robot should be able to go a step further and find new connections. The Telenoid is of this kind.
""This work raises interesting questions about the connection between consciousness and music creating."" says Philippe Pasquier, a musician needs a physical body.
Pasquer argues that the robot musician is faced with a big challenge. ""Its software has already been developed and it can imitate The Beatles, a famous band. However, what made The Beatles famous were not only their songs but their wonderful performance of the songs,"" he says.
It is not clear how a robot would perform music a new way. But by imitating humans, the Telenoid robot could provide some useful information. What is important is that human musicians often listen to and compare music made by others for a long time before creating music of their own. So the Telenoid robot had better listen to more jazz music first. 
 Question:In Pasquier's opinion, the Telenoid robot  _ 
A. will replace human musicians soon. 
B. may have trouble performing music. 
C. will become more popular than The Beatles. 
D. can find connections between things that humans cannot find

Context: The health-care economy is filled with unusual and even unique economic relationships. One of the least understood involves the peculiar roles of producer or ""provider"" and purchaser or ""consumer"" in the typical doctor-patient relationship. In most sectors of the economy, it is the seller who attempts to attract a potential buyer with various appealing factors of price, quality, and use, and it is the buyer who makes the decision. Such condition, however, is not common in most of the health-care industry.
In the health-care industry, the doctor-patient relationship is the mirror image of the ordinary relationship between producer and consumer. Once an individual has chosen to see a physician -- and even then there may be no real choice -- it is the physician who usually makes all significant purchasing decisions: whether the patient should return ""next Wednesday"", whether X-rays are needed, whether drugs should be prescribed, etc. It is rare that a patient will challenge such professional decisions or raise in advance questions about price, especially when the disease is regarded as serious.
This is particularly significant in relation to hospital care. The physician must certify the need for hospitalization, determine what procedures will be performed, and announce when the patient may be discharged. The patient may be consulted about some of the decisions, but in general it is the doctor's judgments that are final. Little wonder then that in the eye of the hospital it is the physician who is the real ""consumer"". As a consequence, the medical staff represents the ""power center"" in hospital policy and decision-making, not the administration.
Although usually there are in this situation four identifiable participants-- the physician, the hospital, the patient, and the payer (generally an insurance carrier or government)-- the physician makes the essential decisions for all of them. The hospital becomes an extension of the physician; the payer generally meets most of the bills generated by the physician/hospital, and for the most part the patient plays a passive role. We estimate that about 75-80 percent of health-care choices are determined by physicians, not patients. For this reason, the economy directed at patients or the general is relatively ineffective. 
 Question:The author's primary purpose in writing this passage is to   _  . 
A. urge hospitals to reclaim their decision-making authority 
B. inform potential patients of their health-care rights 
C. criticize doctors for exercising too much control over patients 
D. analyze some important economic factors in health-care

Context: Jack Andraka from Maryland won the grand prize at the 2012 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. It is the largest high school science competition in the world. The Maryland teenager is the youngest winner of the $75,000 prize. He was chosen from among 1,500 students in 70 countries.
Jack Andraka invented a test for pancreatic cancer  . He started to learn it after losing a close family friend to the disease. ""I went on the Internet and I found that 85%of all pancreatic cancers are found late, when someone has less than 2% chance of survival , "" he says, ""and I was thinking,' That's not right. We should be able to do something.'"" He found that early discovery is important to increasing the chances of surviving the disease.
The Maryland teenager asked to work in a laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and was allowed. There he developed a simple paper test, which can recognize the disease in a single drop of blood. His test has proved correct 90% of the time. It also is 100 times more sensitive than other tests. ""It costs 3 cents per test, and then it takes only 5 minutes to run,"" he said.
Jack's success wouldn't have been possible without Anirban Maitra, a professor at Johns Hopkins. He was the only person among the 200 researchers Jack wrote to who showed interest in his project. ""I was very surprised that this was a 15-year-old who was writing this. I wanted to meet this clever young man and see what he wanted to talk about and so I called him over for an interview . ""
Jack worked in Professor Maitra's laboratory, completing his project in 7 months. The government has given the Maryland teenager patent rights to the pancreatic cancer test. He is now talking with companies about developing the test into a simple product.
Whatever happens, the professor believes Jack Andraka's name is one we will be hearing again over the next 10 to 20 years. 
 Question:Jack Andraka's research on pancreatic cancer   _  .

 Answer: B
Context: We discuss the issue of when to help a patient die. Doctors of our generation are not newcomers to this question. Going back to my internship days, I can remember many patients in pain, sometimes in coma , with late, hopeless cancer. For many of them, we wrote an order for heavy medication--morphine by the clock. This was not talked about openly and little was written about it. It was essential, not controversial.
The best way to bring the problem into focus is to describe two patients whom I cared for. The first, formerly a nurse, had an automobile accident. A few days later her lungs seemed to fill up; her heart developed dangerous rhythm disturbances. So there she was: in coma, on a breathing machine, her heartbeat maintained with an electrical device. One day after rounds, my secretary said the husband and son of the patient wanted to see me. They told me their wife and mother was obviously going to die; she was a nurse and had told her family that she never wanted this kind of terrible death, being maintained by machines. I told them that while I respected their view, there was nothing deadly about her situation. The kidney  failure she had was just the kind for which the artificial kidney was most effective. While possibly a bit reassured, they were disappointed. Here was the head surgeon seemingly determined to keep everybody alive, no matter what.
Within a few days the patient's pacemaker  could be removed and she awoke from her coma. About six months later, the door of my office opened and in walked a gloriously fit woman. After some cheery words of appreciation, the father and son asked to speak to me alone. As soon as the door closed, both men became quite tearful. All that came out was, ""We want you to know how wrong we were.""
The second patient was an 85-year-old lady whose hair caught fire while she was smoking. She arrived with a deep burn; I knew it would surely be deadly. As a remarkable coincidence there was a meeting for discussion going on at the time in medical ethics . The speaker asked me if I had any sort of ethical problem I could bring up for discussion. I described the case and asked the students their opinion. After the discussion, I made a remark that was, when looking back, a serious mistake. I said, ""I'll take the word back to the nurses about her and we will talk about it some more before we decide."" The instructor and the students were shocked: ""You mean this is a real patient?"" The teacher of ethics was not accustomed to being challenged by actuality. In any event, I went back and met with the nurses. A day or two later, when she was making no progress and was suffering terribly, we began to back off treatment. Soon she died quietly and not in pain. As a reasonable physician, you had better move ahead and do what you would want done for you. And don't discuss it with the world first. There is a lesson here for everybody. Assisting people to leave this life requires strong judgment and long experience to avoid its misuse. 
 Question:The author suggested that doctors  _   before they assist a patient in killing himself. 
A. do what they are wanted to do 
B. discuss with the others about the decision first 
C. be required to do so first by the patient 
D. make sure there is no other choice left

Context: On Tuesday,a new study published in the American Heart Association's journal Circulation:Heart Failure revealed that women who ate five or more dishes of baked fish a month had a thirty percent lower risk of heart failure in comparison to women who ate less than one dish a month.
Researchers examined the diets of 84,493 women,whose ages ranged from 50 to 79.The women who had eaten lots of baked fish like salmon ,were more healthy than those who mostly ate tuna or white fish. Eating baked fish also appeared to provide a protection against high blood pressure. The study also found that those women who ate more baked fish were likely to have a lower weight,exercise more and eat more fruits and vegetables in comparison to those who ate fried fish.
Researchers noted that past research had discovered the fatty acids in fish probably decreased the risk of high blood pressure by improving blood pressure along with heart and blood functioning. This study showed the link between eating fish and heart failure risk but it was not designed to show cause and effect.
This study also showed that just by eating one dish of fried fish a week led to a 49% greater risk of heart failure,and eating fried fish led to lower fiber intake and higher calorie intake.
The American Heart Association suggested eating a minimum of two dishes of fish especially fatty fish each week. 
 Question:Compared to the women who ate fried fish those who ate more baked fish could   _  . 
A. be more relaxed 
B. be more healthy 
C. eat more every day 
D. raise blood pressure 
 Answer: B
Context: A new study published recently in the American Heart Association's journal Circulation: Heart Failure reveals that according to a new large study, women who consumed five or more servings of baked fish had a thirty percent lower risk of heart failure in comparison to women who consumed less than one serving a month.
    Researchers examined the diets of 84,493 women from 50 to 79 years old. The women who consumed a lot of baked fish like salmon received stronger benefits than those who consumed mostly tuna, grouper or white fish. The consumption of baked fish also appeared to provide protection against high blood pressure cardiovascular disease . It also found that those women who consumed more baked fish tended to have a lower body mass index , exercise more and consume more fruits and vegetables in comparison to those who consumed fried fish.
    Researchers note that past research has discovered that the fatty acids in fish probably decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease by decreasing inflammation  and improving blood pressure along with heart and blood vessel functioning. This study does show the link between fish consumption and heart failure risk but it was not designed to show cause and effect.
    This study also showed that just by consuming one serving of fried fish a week was linked to a 49% greater risk of heart failure. It also found that the consumption of fried fish was linked to a lower fiber intake and a higher calorie intake. Dr Lloyd-Jones, associate professor with North-western's Feinberg School of Medicine, states frequent consumption of baked fish appears to be part of a suitable pattern that is greatly beneficial for numerous things. This advocates that fish is a very good source of lean protein that we should be increasing as a part of our diet.
Recommendations from the American Heart Association suggest consuming a minimum of two 3.5 ounce servings of fish especially fatty each week. 
 Question:Compared to women who consumed fried fish, those who consumed baked fish  _  . 
A. have a better figure 
B. eat more meat 
C. have higher blood pressure 
D. are more relaxed 
 Answer: A
Context: Have you ever noticed that people have thinner arms and legs as they get older? As we age it becomes harder to keep our muscles healthy. They get smaller, which reduces strength and increases the possibility of falls and fractures  . New research is showing how this happens and what to do about it.
A team of Nottingham researchers has already shown that when older people eat, they cannot make muscle as fast as the young. Now they've found that the ability to prevent muscle breakdown is reduced with age.
When older people eat, they don't build enough muscle with the protein in food; also, the insulin   fails to shut down the muscle breakdown that rises between meals and overnight. Normally, in young people, insulin acts to slow muscle breakdown.
The research just published compared one group of people in their late 60s to a group of 25-year-olds, with equal numbers of men and women. ""We studied our subjects first -- before breakfast -- and then after giving them a small amount of insulin to raise the hormone  to what they would be if they had eaten breakfast,"" Professor Rennie said.
"" The results were clear. The younger people's muscles were able to use insulin we gave to stop the muscle breakdown, which had increased during the night. The muscles in the older people could not. In the course of our tests, we also noticed that the blood flow in the leg was greater in the younger people than the older ones,"" added Professor Rennie. 
However, scientists think that weight training may reactivate muscle blood flow and help retain   muscles for older people. ""In fact, doing exercise three times a week over 20 weeks reactivates the leg blood flow responses of older people. They became identical to those in the young,"" said Professor Rennie. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? 
A. Older people have fewer muscles than the young. 
B. The more insulin we have, the stronger our muscles are. 
C. The insulin in older people's muscles could not stop muscles breakdown. 
D. There is less blood in older people's body.

Context: The First Hello
The man from the telephone department got off the bus, and made his way to the tea stall, wiping the sweat off his head, face, then slipping his handkerchief under his shirt to wipe his neck and back. It was a year ago that the phone line had been installed, six months later men from the public works department had come to put up the phone booth -- a neat box-like structure, with a glass window, and wooden ledges, yellow in colour. And days after that, a painter had taken an entire day to colour in broad, black brushstrokes, the words: STD Booth, local and STD allowded.
No one could tell that the last word had been misspelled. Besides, he had taken the entire day. After he had a cup of tea, he had left, waving cheerfully. And now months later, someone else was here again. 
Everyone watched the man as he sat on the bench. No one said a word, and soon the sound of him slurping his tea filled the hot afternoon. A few leaves fell, heavy in the heat, and sometimes a car passed, on its way to the main city farther away.
When the man had finished, he made to pay but the tea shop owner who sat behind his steaming kettle and the washed upturned cups, waved him away.
""You are our guest here.""
So the man took his handkerchief out again and wiped his face.
They crowded around him as he shut himself up in the phone booth. When the children pressed their nose against the glass, he shooed them away, as he took out a shiny black instrument and placed it on the narrow shelf. A sigh of satisfaction passed through everyone that soon changed to an excited yell as they saw him dial a number, pressing a finger into the ringed dialer of the phone and letting it go all the way in a half-circle. A while later, they hear him say into the mouthpiece, ""Hello."" 
""Hello, "" the children around the booth took up the cry, the teashop owner broke into a smile and the men waiting for a bus smiled and said hello to each other. The sadhu  who sat under the banyan tree nodded wisely. As the sound carried, more hellos were heard. The women winnowing grain giggled as they tried the word tentatively, the shepherds feeding their flocks called out to their sheep, laughing as they used the word. 
""It's a big occasion,"" said the headman, in an awed voice.
""It is, "" agreed those around him. The telephone man emerged and handed over a small chit of paper to the headman. ""This is the telephone number.""
The headman looked at it reverently as if it were a mantra . The others around him read out the numbers slowly, digit-by-digit.
The telephone man was now too tired to notice the cheering around him. He knew he had to wait long before the bus to take him back arrived. As he sipped his second cup of tea, he remembered something else.
""Oh, you can't start using the phone now. The minister will come next month and inaugurate it.""
No one said a word. No one was surprised. They had waited so long; a month more did not really matter.

""It's a big occasion,"" said the headman, in an awed voice.
""It is, "" agreed those around him. The telephone man emerged and handed over a small chit of paper to the headman. ""This is the telephone number.""
The headman looked at it reverently as if it were a mantra . The others around him read out the numbers slowly, digit-by-digit.
The telephone man was now too tired to notice the cheering around him. He knew he had to wait long before the bus to take him back arrived. As he sipped his second cup of tea, he remembered something else.
""Oh, you can't start using the phone now. The minister will come next month and inaugurate it.""
No one said a word. No one was surprised. They had waited so long; a month more did not really matter. 
 Question:What can be inferred from the story? 
A. The man from the telephone department had a mentally demanding job. 
B. Only the minister had the authority to make the first call. 
C. It was a distant village free from modern technology.

Context: Brush your teeth every day, dentists say. In the south of Africa, some people brush their teeth all day long.
They keep a small stick in their mouth to chew or scrub   their teeth all day. People cut the sticks from trees. They are the African toothbrushes. People there are used to brushing their teeth with sticks.
Africans think the sticks work better than toothbrushes. The sticks come from nature, and it is said that there is something special about them. The special thing may stop many kinds of tooth problems. ""If you have a bad tooth, it is a medicine,"" said Diop, a seller in Africa.
The sticks are also much cheaper than toothbrushes.
In Senegal  ,the chewing stick is called ""sothio"". It means ""to clean"" in their language. In east Africa,the stick is called ""mswaki"". It's their word for ""toothbrush"".
Even the dentists agree that the sticks seem to clean teeth better. Nowadays, some nice health stores in the United States start to sell chewing sticks. They think that the stick is natural kind of tooth care. 
 Question:When do the people in the south of Africa brush teeth with sticks? 
A. In the morning. 
B. In the afternoon. 
C. In the evening. 
D. All day.

Context: ""I don't think I can do this any more."" ""Yes, you can. You only have five more radiation treatments to go. "" I held my wife Becky close.
Ever since the breast cancer diagnosis  , she had tried hard to be strong for the kids and for me.   When her diagnosis came, my first thought was there was no way I could lose my wife. The doctors assured us the cancer was discovered early so we were feeling positive.
Becky had received an operation and was recovering from it. After six weeks of radiation therapy , she was facing her final five treatments. She was weak and tired, in low spirits. Seeing her suffering, I felt so helpless and powerless.
As soon as I was outside, long-held frustration and anger erupted in me like a volcano. I took a hammer and suddenly was swinging as hard as I could, beating heavily on the front porch . While doing so, I imagined I was beating my wife's cancer. With all my strength, I destroyed the porch.
During the treatment, my wife had been very brave. She said she had it easy, but I don't think it was easy for her.
Seeing the porch gone, Becky shook her head at the window. I came into the room, not knowing how she would react to what I had done.
""Becky, are you mad at me?"" She looked at me in surprise. ""For what?"" I pointed at the gate. ""For tearing down the porch."" She laughed. ""Look how sunny this room is now. I love that it's bright in here.""
""You comforted me in my darker hour, Vince. You've found a way to deal with your own frustration. By destroying the porch, you let the sunshine in.""
As I looked around the brightened room, I realized the light that filled the space was the light of hope that shone so bright after the darkness. We never did re-build the porch. 
 Question:What lesson can we learn from the passage? 
A. Tragedy cannot separate loving couple 
B. A day without sunshine is like night 
C. True love is based on understanding 
D. Nothing is impossible for a willing heart

Context: For centuries, medical pioneers have refined a variety of methods and medicines to treat sickness, injury, and disability, enabling people to live longer and healthier lives.
""A salamander (a small lizard-like animal) can grow back its leg. Why can't a human do the same?"" asked Peruvian-born surgeon Dr. Anthony Atala in a recent interview. The question, a reference to work aiming to grow new limbs for wounded soldiers, captures the inventive spirit of regenerative medicine. This innovative field seeks to provide patients with replacement body parts.
These parts are not made of steel; they are the real things --- living cells, tissue, and even organs.
Regenerative medicine is still mostly experimental, with clinical applications limited to procedures such as growing sheets of skin on burns and wounds. One of its most significant advances took place in 1999,when a research group at North Carolina's Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine conducted a successful organ replacement with a laboratory-grown bladder. Since then, the team, led by Dr. Atala, has continued to generate a variety of other tissues and organs  from kidneys to ears.
The field of regenerative medicine builds on work conducted in the early twentieth century with the first successful transplants of donated human soft tissue and bone. However, donor organs are not always the best option. First of all, they are in short supply, and many people die while waiting for an available organ; in the United States alone, more than 100,000 people are waiting for organ transplants. Secondly, a patient's body may ultimately reject the transplanted donor organ. An advantage of regenerative medicine is that the tissues are grown from a patient's own cells and will not be rejected by the body's immune system.
Today, several labs are working to create bioartificial body parts. Scientists at Columbia and Yale Universities have grown a jawbone and a lung. At the University of Minnesota, Doris Taylor has created a beating bioartificial rat heart. Dr. Atala's medical team has reported long-term success with bioengineered bladders implanted into young patients with spina bifida (a birth defect that involves the incomplete development of the spinal cord). And at the University of Michigan, H. David Humes has created an artificial kidney.
So far, the kidney procedure has only been used successfully with sheep, but there is hope that one day similar kidney will be implantable in a human patient. The continuing research of scientists such as these may eventually make donor organs unnecessary and, as a result, significantly increase individuals' chances of survival.

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. ""

A. a close friend 
B. a stranger 
C. a classmate

Context: In some parts of the United States, farming is easy. But farming has always been difficult in the northeastern corner of the country, which is called New England.
    New England has many trees and thin, rocky soil. Anyone who has wanted to start a new farm there has had to work very hard. The first job has been cutting down trees. The next job has been digging the stumps of the trees out of the soil. Then the farmer has had the difficult job of removing stones from his land.
    This work of removing stones never really ends, because every winter more stones appear. They come up through the thin soil from the rocks below. Farmers have to keep removing stones from the fields. Even today, farms which have been worked on for 200 years keep producing more stones.
    That is why stone walls are used instead of fences around New England fields. The stone walls are not high; a man can easily climb over them. But they keep the farmer's cows from joining his neighbor's cows. 
 Question:In New England, stone walls are used   _  . 
A. to protect the farmer's fields from thieves 
B. to keep the farmer's cattle from wandering away 
C. to provide privacy for the farmer's family 
D. to prevent the wind from blowing away the earth

Context: Jack Andraka from Maryland won the grand prize at the 2012 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. It is the largest high school science competition in the world. The Maryland teenager is the youngest winner of the $75,000 prize. He was chosen from among 1,500 students in 70 countries.
Jack Andraka invented a test for pancreatic cancer  . He started to learn it after losing a close family friend to the disease. ""I went on the Internet and I found that 85%of all pancreatic cancers are found late, when someone has less than 2% chance of survival , "" he says, ""and I was thinking,' That's not right. We should be able to do something.'"" He found that early discovery is important to increasing the chances of surviving the disease.
The Maryland teenager asked to work in a laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and was allowed. There he developed a simple paper test, which can recognize the disease in a single drop of blood. His test has proved correct 90% of the time. It also is 100 times more sensitive than other tests. ""It costs 3 cents per test, and then it takes only 5 minutes to run,"" he said.
Jack's success wouldn't have been possible without Anirban Maitra, a professor at Johns Hopkins. He was the only person among the 200 researchers Jack wrote to who showed interest in his project. ""I was very surprised that this was a 15-year-old who was writing this. I wanted to meet this clever young man and see what he wanted to talk about and so I called him over for an interview . ""
Jack worked in Professor Maitra's laboratory, completing his project in 7 months. The government has given the Maryland teenager patent rights to the pancreatic cancer test. He is now talking with companies about developing the test into a simple product.
Whatever happens, the professor believes Jack Andraka's name is one we will be hearing again over the next 10 to 20 years. 
 Question:Jack Andraka's research on pancreatic cancer   _  . 
A. proved to be very successful 
B. was 100 times cheaper than other tests 
C. gave patients a 90% chance of survival 
D. was finished at the high school of Maryland

Context: There are various reasons why cancers appear to be on the increase. For one thing, though their sufferers are to be found in all age groups, cancers are particularly likely to attack persons in their middle and advanced years. Naturally, since people live longer these years, there are more cancer sufferers than before. Again, with better methods of diagnosis  , doctors can more easily recognize cancerous growths that would formerly have passed unnoticed or that would have been wrongly diagnosed. It is also believed that certain habits and conditions of modern living, including heavy smoking and the pollution of the air, may leave people living in more cancer-causing conditions than before.
We all look forward to the day when a simple medical test can find cancer while it is still small. Researchers around the world are working on _ . Most of their work deals with the examination of the blood.
Researchers in Boston have found something in the blood of cancer patients that does not appear in healthy persons. The test showed which persons had cancer and which did not. It was correct more than 90 percent of the time.
The researchers believe the test may be able to show cancer very clearly in its development. Cancers discovered early usually can be treated successfully.
The test examines very small bits of fat in the blood called lipids  . Cancers seem to change lipids although doctors do not know why. The test showed differences between the lipids of the persons with cancer and the lipids of those without cancer.
The researchers say the new test could be a step to develop a simple way to check patients for cancer before the disease shows on an X-ray. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. A simple way to cancer 
B. Cancers can be cured 
C. How to find cancer 
D. Early discovery of cancer

Context: Every year, World Blood Day is celebrated by blood services worldwide on 14 June, the birthday of Nobel Prize winner Karl Landsteiner, the man who discovered the ABO blood group system. If you have every thought of becoming a blood donor, just register to do it. And you should never worry about the donation.
Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body.
It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients.
First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday.
Although most people are able to give blood, some people who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease are no tasked to be donors. Pregnant women or those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood.
Blood has a very short shelf life. Some blood components can be kept longer than others, for instance red blood cells will keep for 35 days but platelets for only five. Remember, you should wait at least 16 weeks before donating blood again. 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that  _  . 
A. whole blood is most widely used in hospital 
B. platelets can be kept for more than 10 days 
C. people can donate their blood four times a years 
D. people can donate at most 470 ml of blood each time

Blood has a very short shelf life. Some blood components can be kept longer than others, for instance red blood cells will keep for 35 days but platelets for only five. Remember, you should wait at least 16 weeks before donating blood again. 
 Question:What component of blood is used to treat burned patients? 
A. Plasma 
B. Red blood cell 
C. Antibody 
D. White blood cell

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. "" 
 Question:Jennie gave her bone marrow to   _  . 
A. a close friend 
B. a stranger 
C. a classmate

Context: Today, the biggest killers stem as much from our lifestyles as from bacteria and viruses.  One of the worst of these is heart disease, and specifically high blood pressure. It's a slow, but efficient killer that robs many people of what should be the last 10, 20 or 30 years of their lives.
Scientists are claiming that they have now separated unusual ingredients in a rare seaweed discovered by fishermen off the coast of Korea that offer incredible health benefits--including the ability to restore blood pressure to normal levels.
Dr. Haengwoo Lee, a famous biochemist conducted a clinical study on these two ingredients. The first is Seanol, an extremely rare seaweed extract  from Ecklonia Cava that's proven to be 100 times more powerful than any land-based antioxidant . That's because it stays working in your body for 12 hours, compared to land-based antioxidants that work for 30 minutes.  ""Its secret is its make-up of special chemicals that are a huge 40% fat soluble( ),"" Dr. Lee explains. ""Unlike nearly all land-based antioxidants that are water soluble, Seanol's protective compounds can get into things like the fatty tissues of your brain and penetrate  all three layers of your cells, including the outside, the oil-based cell membranes , and your DNA."" Indeed, Seanol is so powerful, it's the only FDA-approved Ecklonia Cava marine-algae    extract in existence.
The second ingredient is Calamarine, a deep-sea omega-3 discovery that delivers 85% more DHA omega-3s to your heart, brain, joints, and eyes. It's known to reduce the problems from tiredness and poor memory, joint pain, mood swings and depression.
With that research in mind, Dr. Lee combined Seanol and Calamarine with a high dose of vitamin D to form  Marine-D3, the newest supplement in the fight against age-related illnesses and high blood pressure.
Dr. Lee found that Calamarine delivers some of the greatest concentration of omega-3s known to science. Combined with Seanol's ability to reduce body inflammation , as well as help cells get the nutrients they need to thrive, stay healthy and protected, Marine-D3 is able to boost a body's entire well being.
The makers of Marine-D3 are so confident that you'll see fast dramatic results from this product, that if you aren't happy after two full months, simply return the unused portion and they'll buy it back. They'll even give you ten dollars extra just for giving it an honest try! That kind of faith, combined with Dr. Lee's exhaustive research, shows that Marine-D3 really is a one-of-a-kind product. 
 Question:What's the makers' attitude toward Marine-D3? 
A. pessimistic 
B. indifferent 
C. doubtful 
D. Optimistic

Context: Researchers have announced the result of two studies on the health effects of the drug aspirin.One study shows aspirin can sharply reduce the chance that a healthy, older man will suffer from a heart attack.
The study offered two new results from earlier findings, It said taking one aspirin pili every other day helped only healthy men over the age of fifty.It also said aspirin gave the greatest protection against heart attacks to men with low blood cholesterol levels.
Earlier in the United States began a major aspirin study in the early 1980s.It included 22,000 healthy men doctors.Ail were between the ages of forty and eighty-four.More than 11,000 of the doctors took a harmless pill that contained no drug.The men did not know which kind of pill they were taking.
The doctors who took aspirin suffered 44% fewer heart attacks than those taking the harmless pill.139 men who took aspirin suffered from heart attacks.Ten of them died.239 men who did not take aspirin suffered from heart attacks.Twenty-six of them died.
The researchers said the doctors' study provides clear proof that taking aspirin can prevent a first heart attack in healthy, older men.They said, however, the result does not mean every man over the mage of fifty should take aspirin.They said aspirin couldn't help men who do not eat healthy foods, who smoke cigarettes and who are fat.The researchers said men who think they wou3d be helped by taking aspirin should talk with their doctors first. 
 Question:We may learn that the new use of aspirin is   _  . 
A. to treat heart disease 
B. to reduce the chance of a heart attack in old men 
C. to protect old men

Context: The oldest forms of medicine are enjoying a comeback. Modern holistic  medicine is an approach that treats the whole patient, not just the disease. It is a way to maintain good health rather than cure illness. The most important influences on today's holistic medicine are ancient Chinese medicine and Indian Ayurvedic medicine, both of which promoted the whole body health.
Holistic medicine usually combines diet, physical exercise and meditation, together with other alternative techniques such as massage  and acupuncture . Herbal treatment ,a practice of treating illness by using plants, is influenced by the writings of Culpeper as well as Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine. Homeopathy is one of the forms of holistic medicine which is widely practiced in Europe and the USA. Homeopathy began in Germany in the early 1800s, when Samuel Hahnemann described how very tiny doses of a drug had an effect on his patients. According to Hahnemann, the more the drug was diluted , the stronger its effects. The substance selected would produce similar effects to the disease itself if given in large doses. In the UK homeopathy is regarded as a non-traditional but just about acceptable treatment.
Meditation and contemplation have an important role in holistic medicine. They were brought to Europe by Indian teachers who combined Indian Ayurvedic medicine with Western beliefs. Transcendental meditation is one of the best known of these techniques. People repeat words inside their head to reach a state of deep relaxation.
       The holistic movement has made many doctors look at the whole patient, not just the disease. Life-style, emotional problems and diet are just some of the factors that can affect a person's health. Holistic medicine emphasizes good diet, exercise and fresh air, all of which contribute to health. Some clinics now offer holistic medicine along with traditional treatments, so that their patients can choose a combination of treatments that suits them. One problem with holistic medicine is that it is difficult for people to be sure a doctor is reliable. To solve this, many countries want alternative doctors to form professional bodies. 
 Question:The principle of homeopathy is that   _  . 
A. the large doses of medicine will take better effect 
B. the disease will be cured sooner by taking larger doses of medicine 
C. a small thinner dose of medicine will be more effective 
D. the doses of medicine depend on how serious the illness is

Context: Read the following interview with Dr John Bass, an international shark  specialist who has spent many years studying sharks:
First of all, doctor, are all sharks dangerous?
  No, they aren't. There are about 250 different kinds of sharks, but fewer than 30 of them are dangerous to humans. Certain sharks are very aggressive   and we should fear them, but the danger of shark attacks is much lower than most people think.
  So which sharks are dangerous?
  The Great White shark is the most dangerous. Then there is the Tiger shark, which other sharks are afraid of, and the Blue shark. Both of them are very fast and dangerous.
  Which are the biggest and smallest sharks?
  The Whale shark is the biggest shark in the world. It grows up to 15 m in length and weighs as much as six large cars. The smallest shark, which is found near prefix = st1 /Japan, could fit into the palm of your hand because it is only 15-20 cm long.
  Do all sharks have teeth ?
  Yes, they do. Most sharks have hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of sharp teeth. These are arranged in rows of four or more. They fit quite loosely in the jaw. When the front ones break off or fall out, spare teeth move forwards from the rows behind: Sharks get a new set of teeth every two weeks. In 10 years, a Tiger may lose as many as 24,000 teeth!
  That's lots of teeth! What kind of food do sharks eat?
  Most sharks feed on small fish, and they keep the oceans healthy by eating sick and injured fish. However, hungry sharks will eat almost anything, including smaller sharks and even rubbish. Inside one Tiger shark which was found, there was a tin can, a bicycle tyre , a leather wallet and an alarm clock!
  And how do sharks find their food, doctor?
  A shark's sense of smell is excellent. It will follow the smell of blood across thousands of metres of ocean. They also see well, and they have good hearing. Sharks can feel movement in water very easily too, and it is possible for them to feel a fish moving as far as 30 m away. 
 Question:Most types of sharks are   _  . 
A. dangerous killers 
B. not dangerous 
C. afraid of people 
D. found inJapan

Context: Many years ago, when I was working as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Lisa. The poor little girl had a very serious disease and was dying. The doctor had done his best but no medicine really worked. The only chance to save her seemed to be a blood transfusion  from her five-year-old brother. The little boy had the same disease before and had developed the antibodies  to fight the illness.
The doctor talked to the little boy about what they planned to do, and asked him if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate  for a moment. He took a deep breath and said, ""Yes, I'll do it if it can save Lisa.""
As the transfusion was going on, the little boy lay quietly in bed next to his sister. He looked at her and smiled all the time. When everything was done and the colour returned to his sister's face, his smile disappeared and he looked a little afraid. He looked up at the doctor and asked, "" Will I start to die now?""

Context: It's impossible to determine how many people would have lost their lives without the contribution of African-American inventor Dr Charles Drew.
Charles Drew was born on June 3, 1904, in Washington, DC. His early interest was in education, but he was also an outstanding athlete. While in college, he was awarded as the man who contributed the most to sports during his four years in school. Drew's sister Elsie suffered from tuberculosis  and died in 1920. Her death influenced his decision to study medicine.
After becoming a doctor and working as a college instructor, Drew went to Columbia University, where he earned his Doctor of Medical Science degree. During this time he became involved in research on blood and blood transfusions.
At Columbia, he wrote a paper on ""banked blood"", in which he described a technique he developed for the long-term preservation of blood plasma. Before his discovery, blood could not be stored for more than two days because of the rapid breakdown of red blood cells. Drew had discovered that by separating the plasma from the whole blood and then refrigerating them separately, they could be combined a week later for a blood transfusion. Drew became the first African American to receive a PhD in medical science.
After World War II broke out, Drew was called upon to put his techniques into practice. He was named a project director for the American Red Cross but soon quit his post after the government issued an order that blood taken from white donors should be separated from that of black donors.
On April 1, 1950, after he attended the annual free clinic at the John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, he and other three physicians decided to drive back home. As he was tired from spending the night before in the operating room, he lost control of his car. Drew was badly injured and was taken to Alamance General Hospital in Burlington, North Carolina. He was pronounced dead half an hour after he first received medical attention. Drew's funeral was held on April 5, 1950, at the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church in Washington, DC.
But contrary to popular thought, he was not refused a blood transfusion by an all-white hospital. He indeed received a transfusion but was beyond the help of the doctors attending to him. As Dr. John Ford, one of the doctors who survived the accident, later explained, ""We all received the very best of care. The fact that he was a Black did not in any way limit the care that was given to him."" Over the years, Drew has been considered one of the most honored figures in the medical field. 
 Question:According to the passage,   _   might have contributed to the invention of blood banks. 
A. the combination of blood cells 
B. the rapid breakdown of red blood cells 
C. the development of refrigerating technique 
D. the technique of separating plasma from the whole blood 
 Answer: D
Context: In a mountainous area of Brazil, there is a kind of beautiful butterfly which can kill men. If people meet them, they will come down in great quantities to bite and kill, sucking blood and flesh through the wounds they cause.
In June, 1966, a boy named Marl Andre who went into the mountains in search of butterfly specimens   was killed by these butterflies. A country boy saw him when he was just about to catch a butterfly. Suddenly thousands of butterflies came down upon him, covering him all over. The boy struggled and cried as he tried to free himself from their attack. Finally he fell senseless to the ground. Police examined his body and proved that he had died of bites by butterflies.
In New Guinea, there is a kind of needlefish which also kills men. Needlefish likes light. At night, it will swim near the lights of fishing boats, then suddenly shoot out of water like an arrow to its target, and force its 3-inch sharp mouth into a human body. Of-ten people are thrust in the eye, or through the chest or stomach, resulting in death. Sometimes it will even attack the people in a fishing boat in broad daylight.
About 10 persons in the world are killed by sharks every year, yet more than 240 people are killed by needlefish every year. 
 Question:Needlefish comes out   _  . 
A. sometimes at night 
B. both at night and in the daytime 
C. only when boats appear 
D. usually in the daytime

Let's start with the blood sample taken from your arm as you are wheeled in the door. 
By the time you are through the security doors and into the emergency area, that sample could have been sent through to the lab by vacuum tube and analysed by a machine which automatically feeds a preparative result into the clinical database. 
Less than a minute after the sample is processed, the doctors can see the results through the monitors beside every position in the emergency suites. 
As you are being wheeled in, you may notice cameras in the ceiling. The hospital has spent $4 million on its camera security system to protect staff and patients. 
When you come to in the neighbouring Admission and Planning Unit, the clinician  may be looking at all your records, x-rays and even documents sent in by your GP on a Compaq tablet PC wirelessly connected to the network by an 802.11 ""WiFi"" card. 
It's not ideal for viewing images, but it should be good enough for a bedside consultation . 
If the clinician needs to consult a specialist or your GP, the other party can see the same records from home or office through a secure internet connection.

Context: Doctors in hospital emergency rooms often see accidental poisonings . A frightened parent arrives with a child who swallowed a cleaning liquid. Or perhaps the harmful substance is a medicine. Or it might be a chemical product meant to kill insects. These are common causes of accidental poisoning.
In cases like this, look for medical help as soon as possible. Save the container of whatever caused the poisoning. And look on the container for information about anything that stops the effects of the poison. Save anything expelled   from the mouth of the victim. That way, doctors can examine it.
In the past, some people forced poisoning victims to empty the stomach. They used a liquid syrup of ipecac   to do this. But an organization of children's doctors no longer advises parents to keep syrup of ipecac. The American Academy of Pediatrics says some poisons can cause additional damage when they come back up the throat.
Millions of people know a way to save a person who is choking on something trapped in the throat. The method is commonly known as the Heimlich Maneuver or abdominal thrusts. The American Red Cross says a rescuer should first hit the person on the back five times between the shoulder bones. These back blows may ease the choking. If the airway is still blocked, the Red Cross suggests pushing hard five times along the victim's abdomen. The abdomen is the area between the chest and the hip   bones.

 Answer: A
Context: The World Health Organization(WHO)planned to study the relationship between the eating habits of the people and the disease.Two doctors were chosen to make the study.
They flew to Africa south of the Sahara and during the next two months visited ten countries.They found that serious diseases of poor eating, often mistaken for other diseases, existed in all parts of Africa.The diseases were similar and could therefore all be named kwashiorkor .The diseased children are usually from one to four years old.As the illness progresses, the child's stomach becomes swollen by liquid collecting in the body.The skin changes colour and may break out in open sores.The hair changes colour and starts to fall out.The patient loses all interest in his surroundings and even in food, and becomes so weak that he wants to lie down all the time.Stomach liquids are no longer produced.
The doctors reasoned that kwashiorkor was found in the young children of this age in many parts of Africa because of lack of milk or meat.Their mothers gave them foods full of starches instead of greatly needed proteins.They found that the addition of milk to the food of children suffering from kwashiorkor saved many lives. 
 Question:What's the best title for the article? 
A. Milk and Meat Are Daily Necessities 
B. Kwashiorkor and Bad Eating Habits 
C. A New Form of Illness in Africa 
D. A Case of Eating Habits

Context: Since ancient times, people have known about its ability to reduce pain and high body temperature. More than 2000 years ago, the Greek doctor Hippocrates advised his patients to chew on the bark and leaves of the willow.
The tree contains a chemical called salicin . From salicin, researchers in the 1800s discovered how to make salicylic acid . And in 1897, a chemist named Felix Hoffmann at Friedrich Bayer and Company in Germany created acetyl salicylic acid. Later it became the active substance in a new medicine that Bayer called aspirin. The ""a"" came from acetyl. The ""spir"" came from the spirea plant, which also produces salicin. And the ""in"" Well, that is a common way to end medicine names.
In 1982, a British scientist shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in part for discovering how aspirin works. Sir John Vane found that aspirin blocks the body from making natural substances called prostaglandins .Prostaglandins have several effects on the body. Some cause pain and the expansion, or swelling( ; ), of damaged tissue. Others protect the lining of the stomach and small intestine. Prostaglandins also make the heart, kidneys and blood vessels  work well. But there is a problem. Aspirin works against all prostaglandins, good and bad. Scientists learned how aspirin interferes with an enzyme . One form of this enzyme makes the prostaglandin that causes pain and swelling. Another form of the enzyme creates a protective effect. So aspirin can reduce pain and swelling in damaged tissues. But it can also harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine . 
 Question:What can we know about aspirin according to the passage? 
A. Aspirin can treat almost diseases. 
B. Aspirin can create the protective enzyme. 
C. Aspirin can harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
D. Aspirin can protect the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
 Answer: C
Context: The immune system is the body's defender. It identifies, tracks down, and destroys troublemakers before they can hurt the body. Those troublemakers may be, for example, bacteria from a cut or splinter, a measles germ, a cold bug, or even a cancer cell. 
These invaders try to take over our tissues and feed off our bodies' nutrients. If they succeed, we become sick or, sometimes, even die. It's the job of our immune systems to destroy these invaders before they destroy us.
Say you picked up a flu virus last week. Perhaps it entered your body through a cut, from a drinking glass, or from the air you breathe. Of course, you didn't feel it, but the virus made its way into your bloodstream. As soon as it entered your body, it began to reproduce. Viruses have only one goal: to take over your cells. Once inside your body, viruses try to enter cells and disrupt their normal work. If left alone, these viruses would hurt so many cells that you would weaken, or worse, get a serious illness. 
But this flu virus should not be so complacent as it seems to be. As it reproduces in your bloodstream, the virus is met by a certain kind of white blood cell, the lymphocytes. The  _ are the foot soldiers that keep you alive. 
The number of lymphocytes in your body is hard to imagine. Thousands of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence. Your body holds about a trillion --that's 1,000,000,000,000 of them, or about 3,000 in every drop of blood.  _  
Some of these lymphocytes pass through a small walnut-sized organ called the thymus. The thymus is the base of the neck. Here, special hormones turn lymphocytes into fighting cells, called T cells.
T cells have one terrific talent: They can tell the difference between friend and foe; what should be in our bodies and what shouldn't. They do not affect the body 's healthy cells. Yet they attack everything that is foreign to our bodies, such as germs, transplants, and even our own cells which have become abnormal, as in the case of cancer. 
 Question:Which of the following can NOT be detected by T cells? 
A. Transplants. 
B. Cancer cells. 
C. Healthy cells. 
D. Thymus 
 Answer: D
Context: Do you know you could get sick just by walking past a building? The bacteria  that cause Legionnaire's disease grow very fast in large modern buildings. They are carried by air through the buildings and outside. Legionnaire s disease is only one of the illnesses that are caused by ""sick buildings"".
Some buildings can make you ill because their heating and air-conditioning  are controlled . Air from outside cannot get in through the closed windows; This indoor air pollution is a growing problem.
Legionnaire's disease may be the most serious result of sick buildings, but other unpleasant illnesses can appear.People who work in some buildings suffer  from tiredness, feeling sick and headaches. Their offices look bright and clean, but invisible  and dangerous bacteria are in the air around them.
There is an answer to the problem. The air-conditioning and heating can be tested for bacteria. _ This is expensive to do, but the results are good. The people in the buildings no longer get sick, and everybody is happier. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE? 
A. Legionnaire's disease is only one of the results of ""sick buildings"". 
B. There is less and less indoor air pollution. 
C. The bacteria are not dangerous if the offices look bright and clean. 
D. If the tests for bacteria are expensive. the results are good. . 
 Answer: A
Context: For decades, public health officials have puzzled over a surprising fact about HIV: Only about 10-20 percent of infants who are breastfed by infected mothers catch the virus. Tests show, though, that HIV is indeed present in breast milk, so these children are exposed to the virus multiple times daily for the first several months of their lives.
Now, a group of scientists and doctors from Duke University has figured out why these babies don't get infected. Human breast milk naturally contains a protein called Tenascin C that neutralizes HIV and, in most cases, prevents it from being passed from mother to child. Eventually, they say, the protein could potentially be valuable as an HIV-fighting tool for both infants and adults that are either HIV-positive or at risk of contracting the infection.
The research, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was inspired by previous work by other researchers showing that, both in tissue cultures   and live mice, breast milk from HIV-negativemothers was naturally endowed with HIV-fighting properties. Scientists suggested that a few different proteins in the milk could potentially be responsible, but no one knew which one.
As part of the study, the researchers divided breast milk into smaller fractions   made up of specific proteins via a number of filters   -- separating the proteins by size, electrical charge and other characteristics--and tested which of these fractions, when added to a tissue culture, prevented the cells from being infected by HIV. Eventually, they found that one particular protein was present in all the HIV-resistant fractions but in none of the others: Tenascin C.
Tenascin C works by blocking a key protein on HIV's envelope that normally ties up to a receptor on a T cell's membrane called CCR5. In doing so, Tenascin C prevents HIV from mixing with the T cell and injecting its RNA inside.
Still, the researchers say that other natural elements in milk might play a role in fighting HIV as well. ""It's clearly not the whole story, because we do have samples that have low amounts of this protein but still have HIV-neutralizing activity,"" the study's lead author Permar says. ""So it may be acting in concert with other antiviral and antimicrobial factors in the milk.""
Whatever those other factors are, though, the finding vindicates (......) recent changes to UN guidelines that recommend even HIV-positive mothers in resource-poor countries should breastfeed, if they're taking anti-retroviral drugs to combat their own infection.
The next steps, Permar says, are determining which area of Tenascin C is active and whether it can effectively prevent transmission in a live animal. If it works, it could potentially be incorporated   into an HIV drug with broader applications. It's even possible that it could someday be adapted to reduce the risk of HIV transmission in adults as well as infants. 
 Question:Which of the following about Tenascin C is true? 
A. It has become an effective tool in fighting HIV. 
B. It was first found by Permar and her research group. 
C. It can prevent transmission in a live animal effectively. 
D. It can sometimes prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

Context: Children whose parents live well into their 80s seem to have healthier hearts in middle age compared with children whose parents did not live this long. Moreover, the heart advantage continues over time, which should help them follow in their parents' footsteps.
The findings come from the Framingham Heart Study, a study relating to several generations on risk factors for heart disease and other diseases among residents of prefix = st1 /Framingham,Massachusetts.
The worst Framingham Risk Scores - a measure of heart disease risk that uses age, smoking, and blood pressure to estimate a person's possibility of suffering a heart attack - were found in children whose parents had both died before age 85. The best risk scores were found among children whose parents had both lived to age 85 or older.
""A greater understanding of the genetics of risk of heart or blood disease factors and long life may lead to advances in the prevention and treatment of heart and blood diseases in the future,"" Dr. terry commented to Reuters Health.

Context: Pregnancy  and childbirth kill more than 536,000 women a year. More than half of the cases happened in Africa, according to the World Health Organization. In fact, most of the deaths are preventable with basic medical care.
The five leading causes are bleeding, infection, high blood pressure, longtime labor and bad abortions  . Mothers' deaths from such causes were largely reduced nearly a century ago in developed countries.
Experts say that what kill many women are ""the three delays""-- the woman's delay in deciding to go to the hospital, the time she loses traveling there and the hospital's delay in starting treatment. Only about 15 percent of births have dangerous complications .
Women lack education and information about birth control. Husbands and inlaws, may decide where a woman gives birth and insist that she stay at home to save money. However, there is no single solution to a problem with so many factors--shortages of doctors, nurses, drugs, equipment, roads and transportation--though hospital officials are trying many things now.
One  _ measure to solve the problem for the present has been to train assistant medical officers, to perform certain operations. Some African countries are now struggling to train more assistants and midwives   , and provide places for pregnant women to stay near hospitals.
But there is a long way to go. Only 20 percent of women in the continent give birth at the hospital. More than 50 percent stay at home to give birth, and the rest go to local clinics that cannot handle emergencies. 
 Question:Which is not included in the five leading causes of women's deaths during pregnancy and childbirth? 
A. Infection. 
B. High blood pressure. 
C. Traveling long distances. 
D. Bleeding. 
 Answer: C
Context: Such chronic   diseases as heart disease, stroke, cancer and lung disorders are the most leading causes of death in the world. Yet health experts say these conditions are often the most preventable.
The World Health Organization (WHO) points out chronic diseases lead to about 17 million early deaths each year. The United Nations (UN) agency expects more than 380 million people to die of chronic diseases by 2015. About 80% of the deaths will happen in developing nations.
Chronic diseases now cause two-thirds of all deaths in the Asia-Pacific area. In ten years it could be almost three-fourths. People are getting sick in their most economically productive years. In fact, chronic diseases are killing more middle-aged people in poorer countries than in richer ones. The WHO estimates   that chronic diseases will cost China alone more than 500,000 million dollars in the next ten years. That estimate represents the costs of medical treatment and lost productivity. Russia and India are also expected to face huge economic losses.
According to a WHO report, deaths from chronic diseases have increased largely as the result of economic gains in many countries. Until recently infectious and parasitic   diseases have been the main killers in Asia and the Pacific but they are no longer the major cause of death in most countries.
As many as 80% of the deaths from chronic diseases could be prevented, health officials say. An important tool for governments is to limit the marketing of alcohol and tobacco to young people. Also, more programs are needed to urge healthy eating and more physical activity.
The UN aims to reduce chronic-disease deaths by 2% each year by international action through 2015, that's to say, 36 million lives could be saved, including 25 million in Asia and the Pacific. 
 Question:In many countries, what's mainly responsible for increasing deaths from chronic diseases? 
A. The economic development. 
B. The poor living conditions. 
C. Infectious and parasitic diseases. 
D. Young people's bad habits.

Context: The food we eat seems to have profound effects on our health. Although science has made big steps in making food more fit to eat, it has, at the same time, made many foods unfit to eat. Some research has shown that 80 percent of all human illness are connected with diet and 40 percent of cancer is connected with the diet. Therefore, that food is connected with illness is not a new discovery. In 1940's scientists realized that nitrates , which are often used to keep color1 of meat, and other additives caused cancer. However these additives remain in our food and it becomes more difficult to know which additives are helpful or harmful. Farmers sometimes give drugs to animals not because the animals are ill but because they want to sell the animals at higher prices. For example, farmers try hard to make animals grow big so that they can sell the big animals for more money. Although the Food and Drug Administration has tried again and again to control farmers to do so, farmers go on doing this. 
 Question:What are nitrates used for? 
A. They keep flavor of food. 
B. They keep the color1 of meat. 
C. They keep food fresh. 
D. They make animals fatter. 
 Answer: B
Context: Today, the biggest killers stem as much from our lifestyles as from bacteria and viruses.  One of the worst of these is heart disease, and specifically high blood pressure. It's a slow, but efficient killer that robs many people of what should be the last 10, 20 or 30 years of their lives.
Scientists are claiming that they have now separated unusual ingredients in a rare seaweed discovered by fishermen off the coast of Korea that offer incredible health benefits--including the ability to restore blood pressure to normal levels.
Dr. Haengwoo Lee, a famous biochemist conducted a clinical study on these two ingredients. The first is Seanol, an extremely rare seaweed extract  from Ecklonia Cava that's proven to be 100 times more powerful than any land-based antioxidant . That's because it stays working in your body for 12 hours, compared to land-based antioxidants that work for 30 minutes.  ""Its secret is its make-up of special chemicals that are a huge 40% fat soluble( ),"" Dr. Lee explains. ""Unlike nearly all land-based antioxidants that are water soluble, Seanol's protective compounds can get into things like the fatty tissues of your brain and penetrate  all three layers of your cells, including the outside, the oil-based cell membranes , and your DNA."" Indeed, Seanol is so powerful, it's the only FDA-approved Ecklonia Cava marine-algae    extract in existence.
The second ingredient is Calamarine, a deep-sea omega-3 discovery that delivers 85% more DHA omega-3s to your heart, brain, joints, and eyes. It's known to reduce the problems from tiredness and poor memory, joint pain, mood swings and depression.
With that research in mind, Dr. Lee combined Seanol and Calamarine with a high dose of vitamin D to form  Marine-D3, the newest supplement in the fight against age-related illnesses and high blood pressure.
Dr. Lee found that Calamarine delivers some of the greatest concentration of omega-3s known to science. Combined with Seanol's ability to reduce body inflammation , as well as help cells get the nutrients they need to thrive, stay healthy and protected, Marine-D3 is able to boost a body's entire well being.
The makers of Marine-D3 are so confident that you'll see fast dramatic results from this product, that if you aren't happy after two full months, simply return the unused portion and they'll buy it back. They'll even give you ten dollars extra just for giving it an honest try! That kind of faith, combined with Dr. Lee's exhaustive research, shows that Marine-D3 really is a one-of-a-kind product. 
 Question:What's the makers' attitude toward Marine-D3? 
A. pessimistic 
B. indifferent 
C. doubtful 
D. Optimistic 
 Answer: D
Context: Nowadays, the food we eat seems to have great effects on our health. Although science has made enormous steps in making food more fit to eat, it has, at the same time, made many foods unfit to eat. Some research has shown that perhaps eighty percent of all human illnesses are related to diet and forty percent of cancer is related to the diet as well, especially cancer of the colon. Different cultures are more likely to cause certain different illnesses because of the food that is characteristic in these cultures.
That food is related to illness is not a new discovery. In 1945, about 68 years ago, government researchers realized that nitrates, commonly used to preserve color in meats, and other food additives, caused cancer. Yet, these carcinogenic additives remain in our food, and it becomes more difficult all the time to know which things on the packaging labels of processed food are helpful or harmful. The additives which we eat are not all so direct. Farmers often give penicillin to beef and living animals, and because of this, penicillin has been found in the milk of treated cow. Sometimes similar drugs are given to animals not for medical purposes, but for financial reasons. The farmers are simply trying to fatten the animals in order to obtain a higher price on the market. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has tried repeatedly to control these procedures, the practices continue. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is NOT true? 
A. Drugs are always given to animals for medical reasons 
B. Some of the additives in our food are added to the food itself and some are given to the living animals 
C. Researchers have known about the potential dangers of food additives for over thirty-five years. 
D. Food may cause forty percent of cancer in world.

Context: Perhaps it is hard to imagine that a bad tooth could be deadly. But doctors in the Washington area say a twelveyearold boy died last month of a tooth infection that spread to his brain. They say it might have been prevented if the boy had received the dental care he needed.
Experts at the National Institutes of Health say good dental care should start at birth. They say breast milk is the best food for the healthy development of teeth. Breast milk can help slow bacterial growth and acid production in the mouth.
When baby's teeth begin to appear,you can clean them with a wet toothbrush. Dentists say it is important to find soft toothbrushes made especially for babies,and use them very gently.
The use of fluoride   to protect teeth is common in many parts of the world. This natural element is often added to drinking water supplies. The fluoride mixes with enamel ,the hard surface on teeth,to help prevent holes,or cavities from forming.
But the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry points out that young children often swallow toothpaste when they brush their teeth. The group notes that swallowing fluoridated toothpaste can cause problems. So young children should be carefully supervised when they brush their teeth. And only a small amount of fluoridated toothpaste,the size of a green pea,should be used.
Parents often wonder what effects sucking a thumb or sucking on a pacifier might have on their baby's teeth. Dental experts generally agree that this is fine early in life.
The American Academy of Family Physicians says most kids stop sucking their thumbs by the age of four. If it continues,the group advises parents to talk to their child's dentist or doctor. It could influence the correct development of permanent teeth. 
 Question:The boy with a bad tooth died because  _  . 
A. his tooth disease was very deadly 
B. the doctor refused to treat him properly 
C. he didn't receive timely treatment 
D. something was wrong with his brain 
 Answer: C
Context: Earlier this year,my oldest daughter got braces on her teeth,and let's just say she did not go quietly into that dentist's chair.Fear and hate pretty much describe the days leading up to her first appointment.
So when she finally walked out with shiny teeth,a sore mouth and a broken spirit,I told her I was proud of her and took her to Ben &Jerry's for an ice cream reward.Two weeks later,we returned to the scene of the crime.The dentist spent about 45 seconds checking her teeth before sending her on her merry way.Before I could start the car, she was placing her ice cream order.She was shocked when I told her that she wasn't going to get a reward every time we get her teeth checked.
Clearly,she's not alone.According to some parenting experts,kids are easily addicted to a benefit--producing system of parental rewards and bribes--it's not all ice creams,candies and cool toys.Some parents are offering their children prizes to just let them sit down and behave in a restaurant--or sleep in their own beds--or score a goal in the next soccer game.
While the experts agree that occasional awards are okay, the danger lies in the system's overuse.Kids quickly gain a sense of entitlement ,where they come to expect a big reward for every good thing that they do,no matter how small.To keep things in check,experts say parents should reduce the number of rewards they offer,make sure rewards match the behavior and explain the real benefits of behaving for the sake of behaving.
Have you used bribery or a reward system with your kids? Was it successful? Do your kids expect more because of that system? 
 Question:Misguided by the parental reward system,children easily think  _  . 
A. their parents must be far richer than others' 
B. they can be successful as long as they work hard. 
C. they should benefit from their every desired behavior.

Context: Hundreds of secondary schools are using a _ reward scheme which ""bribes""  pupils with iPods and DVD players to turn up in classes and do homework.
Almost one million schoolchildren have been issued with supermarket-style reward cards which allow them to collect good-behavior ""points"" and cash them in for prizes.
Schools taking part in the ""Vivo Miles"" scheme are spending several thousand pounds a year in an attempt to cut truancy   and promote achievements. The prizes are ultimately funded by the taxpayer, through school budgets. Nearly 500 secondary schools, one in six, have decided to take part in the scheme, which is intended to replace old-style rewards such as stickers and golden stars.
But the extent of rewards being offered in schools brought a warning that a generation of children is growing up expecting to be rewarded at every stage. Many youngsters are collecting points for ordinary achievements such as remembering to bring their PE kit and wearing the correct uniform.
Under the scheme, teachers award Vivo points--worth 1 penny each--according to the school's policy. Schools typically spendPS4 toPS6 on prizes per pupil each year, although some commit considerably more. Most pupils accumulate between 400 and 600 Vivos a year. Vivo Miles insists it is ""pretty rare"" for a pupil to accumulate enough points to buy an iPod, which requires 3,100 Vivos.
But Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said the scheme amounted to ""bribery"". ""It misleads children into thinking anything which requires effort has to have a special reward,"" he said. ""This 'all must have prizes' view is damaging to children in the long-term."" The scheme amounted to an ""admission of failure"" by schools. He said. ""It shows a school has failed to convince children education is important."" 
 Question:The ""Vivo Miles"" scheme is aimed at   _  . 
A. increasing the income of the school 
B. encouraging students to perform well at school 
C. inviting more students to attend the school nearby 
D. encouraging parents to donate to the school

Context: The health-care economy is filled with unusual and even unique economic relationships. One of the least understood involves the peculiar roles of producer or ""provider"" and purchaser or ""consumer"" in the typical doctor-patient relationship. In most sectors of the economy, it is the seller who attempts to attract a potential buyer with various appealing factors of price, quality, and use, and it is the buyer who makes the decision. Such condition, however, is not common in most of the health-care industry.
In the health-care industry, the doctor-patient relationship is the mirror image of the ordinary relationship between producer and consumer. Once an individual has chosen to see a physician -- and even then there may be no real choice -- it is the physician who usually makes all significant purchasing decisions: whether the patient should return ""next Wednesday"", whether X-rays are needed, whether drugs should be prescribed, etc. It is rare that a patient will challenge such professional decisions or raise in advance questions about price, especially when the disease is regarded as serious.
This is particularly significant in relation to hospital care. The physician must certify the need for hospitalization, determine what procedures will be performed, and announce when the patient may be discharged. The patient may be consulted about some of the decisions, but in general it is the doctor's judgments that are final. Little wonder then that in the eye of the hospital it is the physician who is the real ""consumer"". As a consequence, the medical staff represents the ""power center"" in hospital policy and decision-making, not the administration.
Although usually there are in this situation four identifiable participants-- the physician, the hospital, the patient, and the payer (generally an insurance carrier or government)-- the physician makes the essential decisions for all of them. The hospital becomes an extension of the physician; the payer generally meets most of the bills generated by the physician/hospital, and for the most part the patient plays a passive role. We estimate that about 75-80 percent of health-care choices are determined by physicians, not patients. For this reason, the economy directed at patients or the general is relatively ineffective. 
 Question:The author's primary purpose in writing this passage is to   _  . 
A. urge hospitals to reclaim their decision-making authority 
B. inform potential patients of their health-care rights 
C. criticize doctors for exercising too much control over patients 
D. analyze some important economic factors in health-care 
 Answer: D
Context: When you're an employee of a company, no matter the size, it's common to see co-workers promoted, or transferred to a different department. But there is another way to move around--by creating a new position for yourself. I did this several years ago, though I wasn't actively looking for a different job.
In 2007, I was hired at the Transamerica Life Insurance Company, as a customer service representative in the distributions services department. I processed requests for distributions from our annuity policy holders around the country. Someone might have forgotten to sign a form, for example, or might have omitted security information. To solve the problem, I'd mail the person a letter.
The company had been through several combinations, so in our department alone we had a collection of about 140 templates  for letters related to distributions. The longer I worked with the letters, the more I saw how they could be improved. Some had overlapping information and could be combined. Some had incorrect grammar or needed updating. I also noticed that industry terminology  wasn't standard across all the versions.
When I told my department supervisor about this in 2008, she agreed that the letters needed _ . She said I should stop what I'd been doing and start the new work. In a relatively short time, I was able to make numerous improvements and reduce the number of letters to 70. It was an informal job change until a managers' meeting several months later.
At that meeting, a vice president who was unaware of my new work mentioned that the division's entire stock of 1,700 letters should be reviewed. My manager told her that she knew the perfect person for the job--me. The position was still considered temporary when I took on the extra tasks, but I was able to show that the work had value, and I was officially promoted and given a raise in November 2009. 
 Question:Which of the following problems with the letters is NOT mentioned in the passage? 
A. Some information was overlooked. 
B. Some information needed to be united. 
C. Some had grammatical mistakes. 
D. Industry terminology didn't meet the standard.

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. ""

A. a close friend 
B. a stranger 
C. a classmate 
D. a

Context: We still don't understand the influence of the mind's power over the body, nor do we understand why there should be such power. All we can say for certain is that the mind does have power over the body in very many different ways.
 If a man is told that he is at the North Pole and he believes what he is told, he'll show physical signs which suggest that his body is reacting as though he were at the North Pole. He'll go pale and shiver. When the film Lawrence of Arabia was shown, cinema managers around the world reported that the sales of ice cream rocketed. The endless desert scenes had made the moviegoers feel uncomfortably hot.
 Hypnotists use the power of the mind over the body in order to use their influence. The hypnotist must only convince the patient that something is true, and the patient will act accordingly. If he convinces the patient that his arms are as heavy as lead, then the patient will be unable to lift his arms. If he convinces the patient that a piece of ice is a hot iron and he then touches the patient's skin with the ice, a blister will develop. The body will react to the suggestion and not to the reality, and signs of a real burn will appear. 
 Question:The phrase ""the reality"" refers to   _  . 
A. a real burn 
B. a hot iron 
C. the touch of ice

Context: Imagine picking apples on Christmas or going skating on May Day. What about going for a swim on Thanksgiving? Without Leap Day ,which takes place every four years, that could happen.
Our calendar is normally 365 days long. It was created to match the cycles of the seasons. But Roman ruler Julius Caesar noticed a problem: The earth doesn't circle the sun in exactly 365 days. It actually cakes 365 and one-quarter days. He figured out that the extra part of a day would cause the calendar to grow apart from the seasons over time. Over 100 years, the seasons would shift  about 24 days. Spring would start on April 13 instead of March 20.
Caesar used math to figure out a way to stop the calendar from shifting. He decided to add an extra day to the month of February every four years. His idea helped keep the seasons and calendar matched up. Even so, it still wasn't perfect--his calendar was adding too many days.
In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII worked on Caesar's idea. His calendar, called the Gregorian calendar, declares that every year that is equally divided by 400 is a leap year. Turn-of-the-century years, or years ending in ""00"", would not be leap years unless they could be divided equally by 400. These complicated equations help keep the calendar in balance with the orbit of the earth. Today, we still use the Gregorian calendar. In about 3,000 years, the calendar will be only one day out of step with the seasons, It's still not perfect, but mathematicians decided it was as close as we could get. 
 Question:Why was Julius Caesar's calendar not good enough? 
A. Spring would start twenty-four days later than usual 
B. It would be only one day out of step with the seasons. 
C. There would be too many days on the calendar. 
D. Leap Day would take place every other year.

Context: When you tidy your messy bedroom,it gets a lot easier to find things.Dreams may work the same way for a messy brain,helping you learn by organizing memories and ideas.
To test how much dreams can help learning,Robert Stickgold had some students play a shapefitting game called Tetris   for a few hours and then go to sleep.Soon they were dreaming of falling Tetris shapes.Interestingly,the worst Tetris players had the most Tetris dreams and improved their game the most.Similar tests have shown the same results for all kinds of skills.
As we dream,many important tasks are getting done.The brain decides what to keep and what to forget.It is connecting new experiences to older learning.In fact,the brain is learning all night long.
Another important task of dreams may be to help us deal with emotions  .At night,emotions are in the driver's seat.People who have had an upsetting experience often dream  about  it  afterward.Often  the  dream event  changes somehow--another way the brain tries to make the memory less upset.So if your best friend moves away,you might dream that you're the one who's moving.In fact,dreams have a proven power to improve mood,and people who dream about what's bothering them usually feel better sooner than those who don't.
Everybody dreams for a couple of hours every night--in the course   of your life,you'll spend about 25 years asleep and 6 years dreaming.There's probably no single answer to the question why we dream,but there doesn't have to be.One dream might help you remember your math facts,while another might lead to a new invention,or give you a fun,crazy story to tell your friends.It's all in a night's work for our busy,mysterious brains.

Context: Ever feel like you've been hit on the head after a bad night's sleep? According to scientists, the thought isn't as unbelievable as it seems.
A study found going without sleep for just one night causes changes in the brain similar to those that occur after a blow to the head. The researchers said the healthy young men examined in the study showed a sudden increase in the same chemicals which indicate brain damage. Professor Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, Sweden, explained that the chemicals NSE and S-100B are biomarkers for brain damage, such as concussion . He said, ""What we found was their levels in the blood rose in the group that went without sleep for a night. This was not to the extent that would happen after a head injury, for instance, but it was still significant. During sleep, the brain cleans poisonous substances off itself.""
Benedict also said previous studies which linked a lack of sleep with increased risk of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis could applaud his study. The rise of the chemicals in the blood after sleep loss may suggest not getting enough sleep contributes to a loss of brain tissue, he explained. Benedict, whose study is published in the journalSleep, added, ""In conclusion, the findings of our experiment indicate a good night's sleep may be critical to maintaining brain health.""
A third of the UK population suffer from sleep-related problems, while the average person now sleeps for only seven hours a night, compared with almost nine a few decades ago. Many scientists believe irregular sleeping patterns lead to illnesses ranging from aches and pains to heart disease, while less than eight hours' sleep a night can lower the IQ the next day. 
 Question:What do we know about previous studies? 
A. They found reasons for brain disorders. 
B. Their findings were published inSleep. 
C. They were supported by Benedict's study. 
D. They focused on brain health.

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle?

Context: For those who have lonely nights and have trouble falling asleep, he is proving the ideal partner. This is a man who does not snore   in bed. And he is happy to wrap a comforting arm around his dearest until morning arrives.
       He does exist. He is the body-shaped pillow, the latest sleeping aid from Japan.
       This pillow comes without a head and is filled with foam. It's made by  _ and has a ""body"" and a flexible arm that can be curled around its owner.
       About 1,000 of the pillows have been sold since they went on sale in Japan last year and many buyers say they are pleased with their sleeping companion.
       ""This pillow makes me feel relaxed because I can hold the arm and feel something warm at my side,"" said 34-year-old radio DJ Junko Suzuki.
       But according to _ , the pillow is more than just an emotional help for those tired of spending the night alone. And it is shaped, the firm says, to support its partner on both sides to ensure a night of good sleep.
       The idea is to curl up in between the body and the flexible arm. The head just rests on the pillow's ""arm muscles"".
       ""My grandmother used to say that there is no more comfortable pillow than another person,"" said the firm president, Tomoki Kakehashi. ""So I thought that maybe people would want to sleep on a pillow shaped like an arm.""
       The pillows, on sale only in Japan for the moment, cost 8,500 yen(around US$80) each and come with shirt-or shirt-shaped pillow covers in blue, pink or green. 
 Question:The purpose of the passage seems  _  .

D. to tell how the body-shaped pillow works 
 Answer: A
Context: If you do not use your arms or your legs some time, they become weak; when you start using them again, they slowly become strong again. Everybody knows this and nobody would think of questioning this fact. Yet there are many people who do not seem to know that memory works in the same way. When someone says that he has a good memory, he really means that he keeps his memory in practice by exercising it frequently either consciously  or unconsciously. When someone else says that his memory is poor, he really means that he doesn't give it enough chances to become strong. 
If a friend complains that his arms and legs are weak, we know that it is his own fault. But if he tells us that he has a poor memory, many of us think his parents are to blame and that he is just unlucky, and few of us realize that it is just as much as his own fault as if it is his arms or legs that were weak. 
 Question:This passage mainly tells us that   _   . 
A. one's memory can be trained 
B. one should practise using his arms or legs more frequently 
C. if someone has a good memory, he is usually lucky 
D. it's his parents fault if he has a poor memory 
 Answer: A
Context: An exercise method (Gyrotonics) designed to stretch muscles and improve strength and balance is becoming popular in the United States. Here's more about Gyrotonics and the man who invented this special form of exercise.
Gyrotonics is a kind of exercise that combines the movements of dancing and swimming with the mental and physical practice called yoga. It helps lengthen muscles, improve balance, and exercise the joints, the parts of the body where bones are joined.
A Hungarian dancer named Juliu Horvath developed this special form of exercise. After he was injured in dancing, Mr. Horvath studied yoga intensely. In the 1980s, he developed a new exercise method as a special kind of yoga to strengthen dancers.
According to Mr. Horvath, his method was based on the octopus ,monkey and cat. He says these animals have no restrictions. They can move in any direction the Gyrotonic movements to help the human body move more freely.
A special machine made of wood and weights  helps guide the body through the Gyrotonics exercises. You sit or lie on a flat board. You put your legs or hands through special cloth handles attached to a line with weights. With the tension created by the weights, you must try to move through the exercises.
Seven kinds of backbone movements form the base of Gyrotonics. For example, you can stretch your back to the left and right or forward and backward. While moving your back, you can also work on arm or leg motions. These movements must be done in a smooth way. Often the motions are circular . 
When Juliu Horvath first developed Gyrotonics, he was the only teacher. Since then, he has taught almost 70 trainers. Now, there are more then 800 official schools in the world where you can learn Gyrotonics. 
 Question:This passage mainly focuses on   _  . 
A. A successful life of Horvath 
B. A popular kind of exercise 
C. Some advice on health care 
D. Some uses of a special machine

Context: Scientists say they have discovered a promising treatment for sleeping sickness, a killer disease that infects  about 60,000 people in Africa a year.
British and Canadian experts say drugs could attack the parasite  causing the illness needs to survive. They say the drug could be ready for human medical test in about 18 months.
The disease, spread by the bite of a fly, is caused by a parasite attacking the central nervous system. It has similar symptoms  to malaria , making it difficult to diagnose. Left untreated, it moves to the brain, resulting in mental confusion and final death
The ""breakthrough"" came at the University of Dundee in Scotland, where scientists were offered money to research diseases ignored by major drugs companies.
Professor Paul Wyatt, director of the programme, said: ""This is one of the most significant findings made in recent years in terms of drug discovery and development for ignored diseases.""
He said the research, published in the journal Nature, represented ""significant progress"" in the development of a full blown drug against the disease.
The World Health Organization said there are between 50,000 and 70,000 cases of the disease a year, with a further 60 million people at risk of infection.
The research in Dundee was _ by partners at the University of York in England and the Structural Genomics Consortium in Toronto, Canada. The two drugs currently available to treat sleeping sickness both have problems. One is with side effects that kill one in 20 patients and the other is costly, only partially effective and requires long-time hospital treatment, the scientists said. 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that  _   . 
A. big drug companies play an important role in the research of the new drug 
B. people who get infected with the disease are mentally disturbed 
C. among 200 people infected with the disease, 5 may die because of the old drug

Context: Tu Youyou, 84, honored with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Oct 5, 2015. She was the first Chinese citizen to win a Nobel Prize in science for her work in helping to create an anti-malaria  medicine.
In 1967, Communist leader Mao Zedong decided there was an urgent national need to find a cure for malaria. At the time, malaria spread by mosquitoes was killing Chinese soldiers fighting Americans in the jungles of northern Vietnam. A secret research unit was formed to find a cure for the illness. Two years later, Tu Youyou was instructed to become the new head of Mission 523. Researchers in Mission523 _ ancient books to find historical methods of fighting malaria. When she started her search for an anti-malarial drug, over 240,000 compounds  around the world had already been tested, without any success.
Finally, the team found a brief reference to one substance, sweet wormwood , which had been used to treat malaria in China around 400 AD. The team isolated one active compound in wormwood, artemisinin , which appeared to battle malaria-friendly parasites . The team then tested extracts  of the compound but nothing was effective until Tu Youyou returned to the original ancient text. After another careful reading, she improved the drug recipe one final time, heating the extract without allowing it to reach boiling point.
After the drug showed promising results in mice and monkeys, Tu volunteered to be the first human recipient of the new drug. ""As the head of the research group, I had the responsibility."" she explained. 
 Question:Which of the following words can best describe Tu Youyou? 
A. Responsible 
B. Traditional 
C. Stubborn 
D. Lucky

Context: A super drug that could remove Alzheimer's  ,heart disease and diabetes   and help people live to 100 is being developed by scientists. Their research is based on the identification of three genes that help prolong lives and prevent diseases which occur in old age. Medically controlling the proteins made by the "" longevity genes"" will allow millions to live longer, predicts Dr Nir Barzilai.
Those whose DNA strongly features the three genes are 80 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer's. The genes also fight against the deadly impact of smoking, poor diet, obesity and lack of exercise.
Already, several laboratories are working on a pill to imitate the benefits of the genes and Dr Barzilai thinks it could be tested within three years. The pill could remove some diseases that damage old age. "" The advantage of finding a gene that involves longevity is that we can develop a drug that will imitate exactly what this gene is doing,"" he said.
Of the three longevity genes, two genes increase the production of so-called good cholesterol , which reduces the risk of heart disease. The third prevents diabetes. They were discovered by Dr Barzilai's team while studying the DNA of 500 Ashkenazi Jews with an average age of 100. The chances of living that long are one in 10,000 but the group, which shared relatively few common ancestors, was 20 times more likely to hit the entury. Dr Barzilai said: "" 30 percent of them were obese or overweight and 30 percent smoked two acks of cigarettes a day for more than 40 years, however they can live to 100.""
But Andrew Ketteringham of the Alzheimer's Society said: ""Alzheimer's disease, a most common disease, is likely to be caused by a combination of genetic disosition , lifestyles and life events. Many genes are probably involved. 
 Question:Why does the discovery of the longevity genes mean a lot? 
A. Because it can bring great benefits to scientific labs. 
B. Because it can help people change their unhealthy genes 
C. Because it helps produce a drug that can make people live longer. 
D. Because it will help scientists build up a new branch of biology.

Context: Babies understand what their mothers say, even when they speak a language their children have never heard before, scientists claim.
The researchers found that one-year-olds reacted in exactly same way to their mothers' voices regardless of whether they were speaking English or Greek, showing what mothers have long known - that babies pick up on tone of voice rather than the words themselves.
The researchers, from Cardiff University's School of Psychology, observed babies as they watched their mothers perform actions with toys using the English words ""whoops"" and ""there"". The scientists studied reactions from one-year-old babies to their mums' voices even when they were speaking both English and Greek, and keeping the same tone of voice. The academics found that babies reproduced the same reactions regardless of whether they knew the language.
Study leader Dr Merideth Gattis of Cardiff University's School of Psychology says, ""What this work showed was that children could have access to understanding simply through tone of voice. We did 'whoops' and 'there' in two languages and got exactly the same results."" The research, published in the journal Cognitive Development, was conducted on 84 babies aged between 14 and 18 months, over the course of a year, with none of the babies having any previous exposure to Greek.
Dr Gattis says that children respond to tone clues in their parents' voices from an early age.
She says, ""Tone of voice is a really useful signal of what someone is thinking. We never have direct access to other people's minds, except the signals in language that they give out."" She says the study shows that it is less important what parents say than how they say it.
Dr Gattis adds, ""A child may ask if you like his / her drawing, for example. You might say yes, but if you don't sound enthusiastic, the meaning may not get across."" Before children begin to speak, parents should use exaggerated tone when speaking to them. 
 Question:What's the text mainly about? 
A. The content of the journal Cognitive Development. 
B. The famous works of Dr. Gattis. 
C. Babies understanding their mothers through tone.

Context: Researchers at San Diego Zoo have been studying what has been described as the ""secret language"" of elephants. They have been monitoring  communications between animals that cannot be heard by human ears.
The elephant's call will be familiar to most people, but the animals also give out growls  . Their growls, however, are only partly audible  ; two-thirds of the call is at frequencies that are too low to be picked up by our hearing. To learn more about the inaudible part of the growl, the team attached (......) a microphone sensitive to these low frequencies and a GPS tracking system to eight of the zoo's female elephants. The researchers could then relate the noises the animals were making to what they were doing. Matt Anderson, who led the project, told BBC News, ""We're excited to learn how they interact and contact with one another.""
The team has already learned that pregnant females use this low frequency communication to announce to the rest of their long gestation   of over two years, in the last 12 days we see the low part of the growl, which we can't hear. This we believe is to announce to the rest of the herd that the baby is upcoming,"" said Dr Anderson.
The researchers believe that this also warns the elephants to look out for coming danger. ""You may think that a baby calf of about 300 pounds would not be as open to predation   as other species,"" he says. ""But packs of hyenas   are a big threat in the wild.""
Female elephants are only in season for around four days every four years and these calls can be heard by males more than two miles away. 
 Question:What is the passage mainly about? 
A. The elephants can speak like people. 
B. The wild elephants' ways to fight against enemies. 
C. The ""secret language"" between elephants. 
D. The special life of female elephants.

Context: Sometimes successful health campaigns can have quite unexpected reactions. The years of warnings about skin cancer mean that Britons are happy to cover themselves in sunscreen or stay out of the sun altogether, but it also means that most of us are not getting enough vitamin D.
Scientists announced yesterday that Britons need to increase to three times the amount of vitamin D they get per day. They called on food producers to fortify their products with more of the vitamin and suggested people should consider taking supplements  to keep levels up. They also suggested getting out in the sun for short periods more often, but they warned against ""sun bingeing"".
The government does not publish official advice on the amount of vitamin D people should take due to a lack of research, says Dr Birgit Teucher of the Institute for Food Research. But in the US, the government recommends 5 micrograms a day. By that count, Dr Birgit Teucher said that around 90% of Britons between 19 and 64 would be lacking in the vitamin because they only took around 3 micrograms a day.
Vitamin D is important for absorption of calcium by the body, which is needed for healthy teeth and bones. A lack of it can lead to serious diseases in both children and adults. The vitamin can be found in some foods but it can also be obtained from chemicals in the skin reacting to sunlight. Dr Barbara Boucher said adults should get 5 to 25 micrograms a day. Shortage of vitamin D may be linked to diseases such as muscle weakness, high blood pressure and rickets .
Dr Birgit Teucher gave several reasons for the lack among Britons. Increasing numbers of office-based jobs mean a lack of exposure to the sun; and the rise of becoming overweight means that vitamin D--which is fat soluble is increasingly stored in body fat, where it cannot be accessed readily.
Professor Brian Wharton of the Institute of Child Health said that children in particular needed to have enough vitamin D to prevent rickets.
Professor Graham Bentham, an environmental scientist at the University of East Anglia, added that babies who were only breast-fed probably need to take supplements in case their mother was vitamin D lacking. Those drinking milk were likely to be OK, thanks to the fortification of the drink.
The scientists called on food producers to fortify milk, bread and breakfast nutrient to enable people to get their daily amount of the vitamin. Prof Graham Bentham added that 30 minutes of sun exposure to the face and forearms between April and October would be _ . Outside these months, the sun is not strong enough in Britain for the body to produce its own vitamin D.
But Prof Graham Bentham warned against spending too long in the sun. ""Sun bingeing is well known to be dangerous,"" he said. ""In any case, vitamin D transformation in the skin switches off after a while so short frequent amounts are better for vitamin D formation."" 
 Question:Which best describes the writer's tone in the passage? 
A. Humorous. 
B. Objective. 
C. Pessimistic. 
D. One-sided. 
 Answer: B
Context: According to scientists' research, the month in which babies are born could affect them in some ways.
Babies born in spring get sick easily. Children born under Aquarius may be less clever than those born in other seasons. They may also have shorter lives than those born in autumn  Scientists believe many of the differences can be explained by the mother's exposure to sunlight in pregnancy .  Sunlight helps lead to the production of Vitamin D in the body. The lack of this in the first months of life may have a bad effect on mental and physical health.
Vitamin D, called the ""sunshine vitamin"", is known to help regulate  thousands of genes during development, according to a study of more than two million people. So Vitamin D has a good effect on health  This study showed that people born from April to June had slightly shorter lives than those born in October, November or December. Similar studies in the USA showed that people born in autumn lived about 160 days longer than those born in spring.
Professor Russell Foster, an Oxford University neuroscientist on seasonal biology, said the conclusions were surprising and interesting. He added, ""These are small effects but they are very, very clear. I am not giving voice to star signs and they are just for fun. But it is true that we are affected by our season of birth."" 
 Question:According to the passage,  _   can help people get Vitamin D. 
A. enough sleep 
B. enough sunlight 
C. fresh air 
D. suitable seasons 
 Answer: B
Context: People should go outside and absorb some sunshine to help increase their vitamin D levels, some experts say. Arthritis Research UK. which is a British medical research organization dedicated to curing arthritis  , says vitamin D deficiency can cause bone loss, muscle function problems and, in some cases, rickets   in children.
The government recommends vitamin D supplements   for pregnant women and children aged under five. But on sunny days, a few minutes outdoors should achieve the same results, Arthritis Research UK says.
Figures show that up to a quarter of the population has low levels of vitamin D in their blood and the majority of pregnant women do not take vitamin D supplements. People aged over 65, pregnant and breast-feeding women and children aged six months to five years old are thought to be most at risk.
Vitamin D is essential to help the body absorb calcium   from food. Low levels of vitamin D can result in serious problems.
Alan Silman, the medical director of Arthritis Research UK, said, ""When the days are sunny, go out for a few minutes and expose your face and arms to the sunshine."" But he also had a warning on overexposure. ""Don't allow your skin to go red, and take care not to burn, particularly in strong sunshine and if you have fair or sensitive skin. From June to August, just 15 minutes is generally enough time.""
""In less sunny months,"" Alan Silman added, ""we recommend that people add more vitamin D in their diet by eating more oily fish such as salmon, tuna, and foods rich in vitamin D, such as cereals  ."" 
 Question:Lack of vitamin D may cause the following problems EXCEPT   _  . 
A. bone loss 
B. muscle function problems 
C. rickets in children. 
D. high blood pressure 
 Answer: D
Context: The vitamins   are named by letters of the alphabet  . Vitamin A is needed by the eyes. There is Vitamin A in milk, butter, and green vegetables. It can be kept by the body.
Vitamin B cannot be kept. It must be supplied all the time by some of the food we eat.
Vitamin C is very important to the body. Without it men's teeth become loose   and their arms and legs get weak. Lemons  , oranges and tomatoes have Vitamin C in them.
Vitamin D is the sun vitamin. We get it in milk and eggs and from sunlight on our skin  . There are other Vitamins, but these A, B, C and D, are the most important.

Context: Recently hand-foot-mouth disease has spread across China. In the past three months, there have been about 41,846 cases   in 30 provinces and regions. The number is increasing. Eighteen Chinese children have died of the disease so far this year.
What causes the disease and why is it dangerous?
Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common childhood illness. It mainly affects children under the age of 10. It gets its name from the rash   that develops on the hands and feet. It can also cause blisters   in your mouth.
A child who has the disease will usually have a fever, a runny nose and sore throat. He or she doesn't want to eat or drink because of pain in the mouth.
Hand-foot-mouth disease is mostly not serious. The fever and rash clear within a few days. But in some cases, the virus   affects the heart, lungs or brain. This puts the child's life in danger.
A virus causes hand-foot-mouth disease. The disease spreads easily where a lot of young children are together, such as in a child-care center. Sometimes it can also affect teenagers and adults.
In order not to pass on the virus, good hygiene   is important. We should wash our hands as often as possible. Especially we should wash our hands before meals and after going to the toilet. 
 Question:_   can help us to keep away from the hand-foot-mouth disease. 
A. Passing on the virus 
B. Taking children to the child-care center 
C. Keeping your hands clean

Context: Many people have never heard of Mesothelioma and are unaware of its symptoms. Although considered a rare form of cancer, each year the number of cases grows. With the prevalence of this disease on the rise, it is critical to understand why and how Mesothelioma develops and what courses of action can be taken in the event of diagnosis. The following is a list of frequently asked questions and answers that will provide you with some information on Mesothelioma, and the legal issues surrounding it.
What is Mesothelioma?
Mesothelioma is the term used to describe a cancerous tumor found in the mesothelial cells of an organ. The organs where this form of cancer is most commonly found are the lungs, heart and abdominal organs. Pleural Mesothelioma is cancer of the lung lining(,)and is the most common form of Mesothelioma.
What causes Mesothelioma?
Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos . Asbestos is often found in building materials used before the mid 1970's. In addition, materials such as pipes, boiler insulation, floor, ceiling and roof tiles may contain asbestos.
How much asbestos exposure will cause Mesothelioma?
Generally, the probability of developing this form of cancer is in accordance with the length of time you are exposed to asbestos. Also, your health is at risk if your exposure to asbestos is intense. It should be noted that Mesothelioma has a latency period of 20 to 50 years. This means that you may develop the disease long after your exposure to asbestos. On average, people tend to develop Mesothelioma somewhere between 35 and 40 years after exposure.
How quickly does Mesothelioma progress?
The onset of Mesothelioma is quite slow. Patients will begin to experience symptoms such as lower back pain and chest pain. These symptoms may also be accompanied by weight loss, fever and difficulty breathing. Unfortunately, once Mesothelioma develops, it quickly becomes aggressive and treatment must be sought immediately.
Can Mesothelioma be treated?
Doctors are able to use several traditional methods of cancer treatment for Mesothelioma, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Like all forms of cancer, detecting the disease at the earliest stage possible greatly increases the patient's chances for survival. If you have worked in an industry such as construction or suspect that you may have been exposed to asbestos, be alert for symptoms and contact your doctor immediately.
What legal courses of action can be taken?
Anyone suffering from Mesothelioma is entitled to compensation from asbestos manufacturers. Additionally, if you are the spouse or child of someone who has died from Mesothelioma, you are entitled to file a claim and seek compensation. 
 Question:Which of the following would be the best title for the text? 
A. Terrible Mesothelioma 
B. Mesothelioma is around us 
C. Frequently Asked Questions About Mesothelioma 
D. Mesothelioma in on the rise

Prof Graham Bentham added that 30 minutes of sun exposure to the face and forearms between April and October would be _ . Outside these months, the sun is not strong enough in Britain for the body to produce its own vitamin D.
But Prof Graham Bentham warned against spending too long in the sun. ""Sun bingeing is well known to be dangerous,"" he said. ""In any case, vitamin D transformation in the skin switches off after a while so short frequent amounts are better for vitamin D formation."" 
 Question:Which best describes the writer's tone in the passage? 
A. Humorous. 
B. Objective. 
C. Pessimistic. 
D. One-sided. 
 Answer: B
Context: Health experts have long known that vitamin D is important for healthy bones and teeth. It may also help to protect the body against diseases such as diabetes and cancer. And now, researchers say vitamin D might help fight brain diseases called dementia  .
Dementia is a brain disease that damages thinking and memory processes, which scientists call ""cognitive   abilities."" Dementia is difficult to treat. Taking care of someone who has dementia is extremely _ . And the disease is very frightening to sufferers. Chris Roberts suffers from dementia. He says the worst part of living with this disease was getting lost while driving. ""The worst thing that I found was getting lost in the car, not just forgetting where I was going-- I wouldn't know where I was."" More than 47 million people around the world suffer from dementia. The World Health Organization reports that 60 percent of them live in low- and middle-income countries.
We get vitamin D from some foods like nuts, lentils   and fatty fish. We also get vitamin D from the sun. But that is not dependable. In some parts of the world, there is not enough sunlight to provide enough vitamin D. Also, sunblock prevents the vitamin from entering the body. To add to the problem, the skin's ability to process vitamin D weakens as a person ages.
Researchers at Rutgers University in New Jersey are exploring the relationship between vitamin D and dementia. The team recently measured vitamin D levels and cognitive ability in older people. Nutritional sciences professor Joshua Miller led the team. He said cognitive abilities differed among the study subjects. He said tests showed that about 60 percent of the group was low in vitamin D. 
 Question:Which of the following is true about vitamin D? 
A. Vitamin D can decrease people's risk of heart diseases. 
B. Vitamin D helps the body fight against cancer. 
C. Vitamin D is mainly obtained from the sun. 
D. The need for Vitamin D decreases as people age. 
 Answer: B
Context: People should go outside and absorb some sunshine to help increase their vitamin D levels, some experts say. Arthritis Research UK. which is a British medical research organization dedicated to curing arthritis  , says vitamin D deficiency can cause bone loss, muscle function problems and, in some cases, rickets   in children.
The government recommends vitamin D supplements   for pregnant women and children aged under five. But on sunny days, a few minutes outdoors should achieve the same results, Arthritis Research UK says.
Figures show that up to a quarter of the population has low levels of vitamin D in their blood and the majority of pregnant women do not take vitamin D supplements. People aged over 65, pregnant and breast-feeding women and children aged six months to five years old are thought to be most at risk.
Vitamin D is essential to help the body absorb calcium   from food. Low levels of vitamin D can result in serious problems.
Alan Silman, the medical director of Arthritis Research UK, said, ""When the days are sunny, go out for a few minutes and expose your face and arms to the sunshine."" But he also had a warning on overexposure. ""Don't allow your skin to go red, and take care not to burn, particularly in strong sunshine and if you have fair or sensitive skin. From June to August, just 15 minutes is generally enough time.""
""In less sunny months,"" Alan Silman added, ""we recommend that people add more vitamin D in their diet by eating more oily fish such as salmon, tuna, and foods rich in vitamin D, such as cereals  ."" 
 Question:Lack of vitamin D may cause the following problems EXCEPT   _  . 
A. bone loss 
B. muscle function problems 
C. rickets in children. 
D. high blood pressure

Context: Darek Fidyka, a 38-year-old Bulgarian, had been paralyzed   from the chest down for four years after a knife attack. Scientists from Britain and Poland took cells from his nose, transplanted   them into his back and re-grew his spinal cord  . Now he can walk and even drive a car. The doctors were delighted but said it was the first step in a long journey.
The breakthrough came after 40 years of research by Professor Geoff Raisman, who found that cells had the possibility to repair damage to nasal   nerves, the only part of the nervous system that constantly re-grows. ""The idea was to take something from an area where the nervous system can repair itself and put it into an area that doesn't repair itself,"" Professor Raisman said.
Polish doctors injected   the nasal cells into Mr Fidyka's spinal cord above the injury and used some nerves from his ankle to form a bridge across the damaged tissue. The nasal cells appear to have caused the spinal nerves to repair themselves.
Professor Raisman achieved this with rats in the late 1990's, but this is his greatest success. ""I think the moment of discovery for me was Christmas in 1997 when I first saw a rat, which couldn't control its hand, put its hand out to me. That was an exciting moment, because I realized then that my belief that the nervous system could be repaired was true.""
Doctors chose the easiest case for their first attempt--it might not work for others. But there is a real sense of hope that an idea once thought impossible has been realized.
David Nicholls, who helped provide money for the breakthrough, said information about the breakthrough would be made available to researchers across the globe.
""What you've got to understand is that for three million paralyzed people in the world today, the world looks a totally brighter place than it did yesterday,"" he said. 
 Question:What made Professor Geoff Raisman begin to believe the nervous system can be repaired? 
A. His former study with other people. 
B. His operation on a paralyzed patient. 
C. His sudden thought about Christmas. 
D. His unusual experience with a sick rat. 
 Answer: D
Context: If you were asked what your body is made of, probably you would say that it is made of flesh  and bones and covered with skin. You also know something about the blood which flows through it, and that there is a very important part which we call the brain.
But the flesh and the bones make up the largest part of the body, and there is a good deal to be learned about them. You know the general appearance of both flesh and bone from the parts of animals which you see in the butcher's shop.
Bone is hard, and of a white color; indeed, it looks more like a piece of wood or stone than a part of a living animal. But bone is a real part of the living body, and it grows and is nourished  just as the body is. If a man breaks the bone of his arm or his leg, it is firmly bound up, to prevent the broken parts from moving out of the proper places, and in time then bone grows together again and becomes quite strong.
The bones are fastened together by various kinds of joints . They form the framework of the body, and give it strength to retain its proper shape. This framework is called the skeleton . Some animals, such as worms and slugs, have no skeleton; and others, such as shellfish, have a kind of hard covering or skeleton outside.
The most important part of the skeleton is the backbone. It is so important that naturalists divide all animals into two classes,--- those which have a backbone and those which have none. All the higher animals, including man, have a backbone, or vertebral column as it is called. They are therefore called vertebrate  animals. The others are called invertebrate animals. 
 Question:From the passage, we know higher animals are called  _  . 
A. backbone 
B. human beings 
C. vertebrate animals 
D. skeleton

Context: Everyone who has eaten instant noodles  before knows how it looks like. It is very easy to cook it instantly by putting the noodles into the boiling water and add in those MSG packets, together with your other ingredients  like eggs or vegetables. However, have you ever wondered whether this is the correct way of cooking it? When you first took out the noodles from the packaging, you will notice that the noodles are joined together nicely as a piece. In order to make the noodles joined together nicely side by side, it needs some form of wax coating   to achieve an attractive instant noodles in front of us.
Many people who enjoy eating instant noodles frequently do not really bother too much of it, as it seems very normal to everyone to have it nicely displayed in front of us. However, researches have shown that the layer of wax coating on the noodles is quite harmful to our body and we should not eat it too frequently. It is advisable to have a break of 2-3 days before we start to eat another packet of instant noodles as our body need about 3 days to clear that layer of wax coating away from our body system. Do you know the danger of having too much wax coating stored in our stomach? It will lead to CANCER if it is stored in our body system for a long period of time.
There are 2 keys points to take note while preparing instant noodles: 1) Wash the instant noodles with warm water first, stir it and pour away the water containing the wax coating.
2) Repeat Step 1 and try to stir the noodles again to wash away the wax coating on the noodles before cooking it in a new pot of water.

Context: ""Fingers were made before forks."" When a person gives up good manners, put aside knife and fork, and dives into his food, someone is likely to repeat that saying.
The fork was an ancient agricultural tool, but for centuries no one thought of eating with it. Not until the eleventh century, when a young lady from Constantinople brought her fork to Italy, did the custom reach Europe.
By the fifteenth century the use of the fork was wide-spread in Italy. The English explanation was that Italians were unwilling to eat food touched with fingers, ""seeing all men's fingers are not alike clean.
Anyone who used a fork to eat with was laughed at in England for the next hundred years. Not until the late 1600's did using a fork become a common custom. 
 Question:The custom of eating with a fork was   _  . 
A. brought to Europe from America 
B. begun when forks first invented 
C. brought to Europe from Constantinople 
D. thought of by the Italians

Context: Invented in Turkey and patented by Nanopool, a German company, the spray-on liquid glass might become one of the most useful inventions in the field of nanotechnology. The product was tested at the Saarbrucken Institute for New Materials. 
It is worth mentioning that the invention is transparent and non-poisonous. The liquid glass can protect any type of surface from damages caused by water, UV radiation, dirt, heat, and bacterial infections. Besides, it is flexible and breathable, which means that the liquid glass can be applied on plants and seeds as well. Researchers found that the spray greatly increases the resistance of plants to bacteria-caused diseases. The trials also showed that the sprayed seeds grew faster. 
Depending on the type of surface that is to be covered, researchers can add water or ethanol to the spray. Scientists say that  _ . The spray produces a coating that is just 100nm thick. Trials by food processing plants in Germany have concluded that foods covered with the glass can store longer than those stored in normal condition.
According to Neil McClelland, UK project manager with Nanopool, due to its capabilities, the spray-on liquid glass can become one of the most useful inventions around the world, ending up being used by a lot of industries that will cover their products. At present, the invention is being used by a train company and a hotel chain in the UK, as well as a hamburger chain in Germany that are carrying out tests of the liquid glass for various uses. 
The spray-on liquid glass was also tested in a Lancashire hospital, where it showed ""very promising"" results, being used to cover medical equipment and bandages. The invention could be also used on clothing, because it cannot be seen by the naked eye, thus clothes could become stain resistant. Due to its unique characteristics, the liquid glass can be used to cover bathrooms, sinks and many other surfaces in the home. According to the researchers, the spay-on glass can last for a year. It is expected to hit the DIY stores across Britain at a price of 5 pounds. 
 Question:Which of the following about the liquid glass is NOTtrue? 
A. We can still see an object clearly covered with the liquid. 
B. It will cause plants to have some kind of disease. 
C. Plants still have access to oxygen when covered by it. 
D. It can speed up the growth of seeds.

Context: ""Oh please God, no, no!"" Stephen Eldredge cried out when he saw his wife, Shelli, badly wounded on the side of the road. She had broken actually every long bone in her body, along with her pelvis, jaw, and cheekbones. He was terrified his bride would bleed to death.
Stephen and Shelli had married just six months before near their home in South Jordan, Utah. They were in Hawaii on a family vacation with two of their sons. The family had rented electric motors and headed towards a nature preserve near Waikiki. But Shelli had fallen behind and the family turned back to make sure she was okay.
Shelli lost so much blood that her heart couldn't function properly and she went into shock at the hospital. Physicians were able to make her come to herself. On the first and second days there, she lived through half a dozen operations. On day three, the worst of Stephen's fears came true. Shelli didn't wake. She had shown heart failure and lung failure. ""I thought every heartbeat would be her last,"" Stephen says.
As days passed with no change, one doctor gently asked if it was time to let Shelli go. An MRI showed her brain didn't have much chance of supporting life. Stephen couldn't bear the thought of trapping his wife's beautiful spirit in a body that would never work. If he kept her alive, what kind of life would she have ? He called family, religious leaders, and physician friends in Utah for guidance.
And he decided there still was a chance.
The family moved Shelli to a Utah hospital closer to home. In the next few weeks she started opening her eyes, but it wasn't entirely clear how conscious she was. Nearly seven weeks after the accident, Stephen was joking with his sister in the hospital room when he saw Shelli smile, a big toothy grin. ""Did you understand that?"" he asked. She smiled again. Stephen fell to his knees in thanks.
Shelli's recovery has been slow but steady. Initially, she couldn't remember much of the previous months, including her own wedding. Shelli has endured 17 operations so far and may require more surgery. She will definitely need more months of recovery. But she is able to walk. ""She's got her life back. She's able to love and be loved, and be the person she was."" Elovie says.
When Shelli hears about each step in her recovery, she calls it ""miracle after miracle"". As for his experience, Stephen says, ""This is a story of fear that was slowly replaced by faith."" 
 Question:By saying ""miracle after miracle"", Shelli means that  _  . 
A. she suffered what a terrible accident 
B. she appreciated the care of her husband so much 
C. the love for her family got her life back 
D. it really surprised her that she survived so many operations

Context: A mom in Australia was told by a doctor that her newborn son was ""dead"",but she helped bring him back to life  by holding the baby against her body. She used a method known as ""kangaroo care "".The child,named Jamie,was born after only 27 weeks with his twin sister,Emily,at a hospital in Sydney.Her birth went well,but his was a different story.The doctor struggled for 20 minutes to save him before declaring him dead.
""His little arms and legs were just falling down away from his body,"" Kate Ogg said.""I took my coat off and put him on my chest with his head over my arm."" She and her husband,David,spoke to the child as she continued to hold him for nearly two hours.During that time,the twopound baby showed signs of life.She said,""I told my mom,who was there,that he was still alive.Then he held out his hand and grabbed my finger.""
The doctor at first ignored the baby's movements,but when he put the stethoscope   to its chest,his mouth fell wide open and he said,""It's my fault.It's a miracle  .""
""The care helps the baby keep body warmth,"" Dr Pinchi Srinivasan said.""It also regulates   heart and breathing rates and is believed to help weight gain and improve sleeping habits.Fathers can also use 'kangaroo care'.The key to the method is skintoskin contact.""

Context: We discuss the issue of when to help a patient die. Doctors of our generation are not newcomers to this question. Going back to my internship days, I can remember many patients in pain, sometimes in coma , with late, hopeless cancer. For many of them, we wrote an order for heavy medication--morphine by the clock. This was not talked about openly and little was written about it. It was essential, not controversial.
The best way to bring the problem into focus is to describe two patients whom I cared for. The first, formerly a nurse, had an automobile accident. A few days later her lungs seemed to fill up; her heart developed dangerous rhythm disturbances. So there she was: in coma, on a breathing machine, her heartbeat maintained with an electrical device. One day after rounds, my secretary said the husband and son of the patient wanted to see me. They told me their wife and mother was obviously going to die; she was a nurse and had told her family that she never wanted this kind of terrible death, being maintained by machines. I told them that while I respected their view, there was nothing deadly about her situation. The kidney  failure she had was just the kind for which the artificial kidney was most effective. While possibly a bit reassured, they were disappointed. Here was the head surgeon seemingly determined to keep everybody alive, no matter what.
Within a few days the patient's pacemaker  could be removed and she awoke from her coma. About six months later, the door of my office opened and in walked a gloriously fit woman. After some cheery words of appreciation, the father and son asked to speak to me alone. As soon as the door closed, both men became quite tearful. All that came out was, ""We want you to know how wrong we were.""
The second patient was an 85-year-old lady whose hair caught fire while she was smoking. She arrived with a deep burn; I knew it would surely be deadly. As a remarkable coincidence there was a meeting for discussion going on at the time in medical ethics . The speaker asked me if I had any sort of ethical problem I could bring up for discussion. I described the case and asked the students their opinion. After the discussion, I made a remark that was, when looking back, a serious mistake. I said, ""I'll take the word back to the nurses about her and we will talk about it some more before we decide."" The instructor and the students were shocked: ""You mean this is a real patient?"" The teacher of ethics was not accustomed to being challenged by actuality. In any event, I went back and met with the nurses. A day or two later, when she was making no progress and was suffering terribly, we began to back off treatment. Soon she died quietly and not in pain. As a reasonable physician, you had better move ahead and do what you would want done for you. And don't discuss it with the world first. There is a lesson here for everybody. Assisting people to leave this life requires strong judgment and long experience to avoid its misuse.

As it got worse, she became more and more worried. It was important for her to see the notes and homework the teacher wrote on the board.
In class, she asked for a desk that was closer to the blackboard. One day, her teacher said, ""Carmen, I've noticed you squinting a lot. Are you having trouble seeing the board?"" Carmen shook her head. ""I'm fine, Mrs. Cruz.""
At home, she had to sit closer and closer to the television. Her mother noticed her squinting as she watched her favorite shows.
""Tomorrow I will go to see a doctor,"" she said firmly. Three days later, Carmen had new glasses. She was told to wear them all the time. ""All of the kids at school will think I am anerd ,"" she said. ""You look just as beautiful with those glasses on as you do without them,"" her mother said. But Carmen didn't believe her.
The next day, Carmen kept the glasses in her pocket as she walked into the schoolyard. Suddenly, she heard her friend Theresa shout. ""What's wrong?"" she asked.
""My silver ring is gone!"" Theresa cried. Carmen could tell that Theresa was very upset. They all looked for the ring in the grassy area of the playground.
Carmen realized that she could search better if she could see better. She took the glasses out of her pocket and put them on. Everything looked so different! So clear! And aglimmer   of silver caught her eye.
""Here it is,"" she shouted. ""Thanks Carmen,"" Theresa said. ""I didn't know you wore glasses. They look great!"" ""Thanks,"" Carmen replied shyly.
As they walked back toward the school building, two more girls praised her glasses. Carmen smiled. ""Maybe wearing glasses won't be so bad after all,"" she thought.

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. "" 
 Question:Jennie gave her bone marrow to   _  . 
A. a close friend 
B. a stranger 
C. a classmate 
D. a

Context: There are various reasons why cancers appear to be on the increase. For one thing, though their sufferers are to be found in all age groups, cancers are particularly likely to attack persons in their middle and advanced years. Naturally, since people live longer these years, there are more cancer sufferers than before. Again, with better methods of diagnosis  , doctors can more easily recognize cancerous growths that would formerly have passed unnoticed or that would have been wrongly diagnosed. It is also believed that certain habits and conditions of modern living, including heavy smoking and the pollution of the air, may leave people living in more cancer-causing conditions than before.
We all look forward to the day when a simple medical test can find cancer while it is still small. Researchers around the world are working on _ . Most of their work deals with the examination of the blood.
Researchers in Boston have found something in the blood of cancer patients that does not appear in healthy persons. The test showed which persons had cancer and which did not. It was correct more than 90 percent of the time.
The researchers believe the test may be able to show cancer very clearly in its development. Cancers discovered early usually can be treated successfully.
The test examines very small bits of fat in the blood called lipids  . Cancers seem to change lipids although doctors do not know why. The test showed differences between the lipids of the persons with cancer and the lipids of those without cancer.
The researchers say the new test could be a step to develop a simple way to check patients for cancer before the disease shows on an X-ray.

Context: Women are friendly. But men are more competitive. Why? Researchers have found it's all down to the hormone oxytocin . Although known as the love hormone, it affects the sexes differently.
""Women tend to be social in their behavior. They often share with others. But men tend to be competitive. They are trying to improve their social status,"" said Professor Ryan.
Generally, people believe that the hormone exytocin is let out in our body in various social situations and our body creates a large amount of it during positive social interaction such as falling in love or giving birth.
But in a previous experiment Professor Ryan found that the hormone is also let out in our body during negative social interactions such as envy.
Further researches showed that in men the hormone oxytocin improves the ability to recognize competitive relationships, but in women it raises the ability to recognize friendship.
Professor Ryan's recent experiment used 62 men and women aged 20 to 37.
Half of the participants received oxytocin. The other half received placebo . [( )] [( :Love my Dog.)] 
After a week, the two groups switched with participants. They went through the same procedure with the other material.
Following each treatment, they were shown some video pictures with different social interactions. Then they were asked to analyze the relationships by answering some questions. The questions were about telling friendship from competition. And their answers should be based on gestures, body language and facial expressions.
The results indicated that, after treatment with oxytocin, men's ability to correctly recognize competitive relationships improved, but in women it was the ability to correctly recognize friendship that got better.
Professor Ryan thus concluded: ""Our experiment proves that the hormone oxytocin can raise people's abilities to better distinguish different social interactions. And the behavior differences between men and women are caused by biological factor that are mainly hormonal."" 
 Question:Why did Professor Ryan conduct the recent experiment? 
A. To test the effect of oxytocin on the ability to recognize social interactions. 
B. To know the differences between friendship and competition. 
C. To know people's different abilities to answer questions. 
D. To test people's understanding of body language.

Context: Many jobs must be done with two people. One person takes the lead. The other helps. So it is with the human body. Much of our body depends on the cooperation between substances. When they work together, chemical reactions take place smoothly. Body systems are kept in balance.
Some of the most important helpers in the job of good health are the substances we call vitamins. The word ""vitamin"" dates back to Polish scientist Casimir Funk in 1912. He was studying a substance in rice. Funk believed the substance belonged to a group of chemicals known as amines  . He added the Latin word ""vita"", meaning life. So he called the substance a ""vitamine""--an amine necessary for life.
Other studies found that not all vitamins were amines. So the name was shortened to vitamin. But Funk was correct in recognizing their importance.
Scientists have discovered 14 kinds of vitamins. They say vitamins help to carry out chemicals changes within cells. If we do not get enough of the vitamins, we are at risk of developing a number of diseases. _ brings us back to James Lind of Scotland. In the 1740s, Lind was a doctor for the British Navy. He was investigating a problem that had existed in the Navy for many years.
The problem was the disease scurvy . The sailors were weak from bleeding inside their bodies. Even the smallest wound would not heal. Doctor Lind thought the sailors were getting sick because they failed to eat some kinds of foods when they were at sea for many months.
Doctor Lind separated twelve sailors who had scurvy into two groups. He gave each group different foods to eat. One group got oranges and lemons. The other did not. The men who ate the fruit began to improve within seven days. The other men got weaker.
However, which foods should be eaten to keep us healthy? Let us look at some important vitamins for these answers. 
 Question:Why was the name ""vitamine"" shortened to ""vitamin""? 
A. Because Funk was totally wrong. 
B. Because few vitamins were amines. 
C. Because there were new findings. 
D. Because the latter was easy to remember. 
 Answer: C
Context: People should go outside and absorb some sunshine to help increase their vitamin D levels, some experts say. Arthritis Research UK. which is a British medical research organization dedicated to curing arthritis  , says vitamin D deficiency can cause bone loss, muscle function problems and, in some cases, rickets   in children.
The government recommends vitamin D supplements   for pregnant women and children aged under five. But on sunny days, a few minutes outdoors should achieve the same results, Arthritis Research UK says.
Figures show that up to a quarter of the population has low levels of vitamin D in their blood and the majority of pregnant women do not take vitamin D supplements. People aged over 65, pregnant and breast-feeding women and children aged six months to five years old are thought to be most at risk.
Vitamin D is essential to help the body absorb calcium   from food. Low levels of vitamin D can result in serious problems.
Alan Silman, the medical director of Arthritis Research UK, said, ""When the days are sunny, go out for a few minutes and expose your face and arms to the sunshine."" But he also had a warning on overexposure. ""Don't allow your skin to go red, and take care not to burn, particularly in strong sunshine and if you have fair or sensitive skin. From June to August, just 15 minutes is generally enough time.""
""In less sunny months,"" Alan Silman added, ""we recommend that people add more vitamin D in their diet by eating more oily fish such as salmon, tuna, and foods rich in vitamin D, such as cereals  ."" 
 Question:Lack of vitamin D may cause the following problems EXCEPT   _  . 
A. bone loss 
B. muscle function problems 
C. rickets in children. 
D. high blood pressure 
 Answer: D
Context: Since ancient times, people have known about its ability to reduce pain and high body temperature. More than 2000 years ago, the Greek doctor Hippocrates advised his patients to chew on the bark and leaves of the willow.
The tree contains a chemical called salicin . From salicin, researchers in the 1800s discovered how to make salicylic acid . And in 1897, a chemist named Felix Hoffmann at Friedrich Bayer and Company in Germany created acetyl salicylic acid. Later it became the active substance in a new medicine that Bayer called aspirin. The ""a"" came from acetyl. The ""spir"" came from the spirea plant, which also produces salicin. And the ""in"" Well, that is a common way to end medicine names.
In 1982, a British scientist shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in part for discovering how aspirin works. Sir John Vane found that aspirin blocks the body from making natural substances called prostaglandins .Prostaglandins have several effects on the body. Some cause pain and the expansion, or swelling( ; ), of damaged tissue. Others protect the lining of the stomach and small intestine. Prostaglandins also make the heart, kidneys and blood vessels  work well. But there is a problem. Aspirin works against all prostaglandins, good and bad. Scientists learned how aspirin interferes with an enzyme . One form of this enzyme makes the prostaglandin that causes pain and swelling. Another form of the enzyme creates a protective effect. So aspirin can reduce pain and swelling in damaged tissues. But it can also harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine . 
 Question:What can we know about aspirin according to the passage? 
A. Aspirin can treat almost diseases. 
B. Aspirin can create the protective enzyme. 
C. Aspirin can harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
D. Aspirin can protect the inside of the stomach and small intestine.

Context: Perhaps it is hard to imagine that a bad tooth could be deadly. But doctors in the Washington area say a twelveyearold boy died last month of a tooth infection that spread to his brain. They say it might have been prevented if the boy had received the dental care he needed.
Experts at the National Institutes of Health say good dental care should start at birth. They say breast milk is the best food for the healthy development of teeth. Breast milk can help slow bacterial growth and acid production in the mouth.
When baby's teeth begin to appear,you can clean them with a wet toothbrush. Dentists say it is important to find soft toothbrushes made especially for babies,and use them very gently.
The use of fluoride   to protect teeth is common in many parts of the world. This natural element is often added to drinking water supplies. The fluoride mixes with enamel ,the hard surface on teeth,to help prevent holes,or cavities from forming.
But the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry points out that young children often swallow toothpaste when they brush their teeth. The group notes that swallowing fluoridated toothpaste can cause problems. So young children should be carefully supervised when they brush their teeth. And only a small amount of fluoridated toothpaste,the size of a green pea,should be used.
Parents often wonder what effects sucking a thumb or sucking on a pacifier might have on their baby's teeth. Dental experts generally agree that this is fine early in life.
The American Academy of Family Physicians says most kids stop sucking their thumbs by the age of four. If it continues,the group advises parents to talk to their child's dentist or doctor. It could influence the correct development of permanent teeth. 
 Question:The boy with a bad tooth died because  _  . 
A. his tooth disease was very deadly 
B. the doctor refused to treat him properly 
C. he didn't receive timely treatment 
D. something was wrong with his brain 
 Answer: C

Context: If a diver surfaces too quickly, he may suffer the bends. Nitrogen   dissolved   in his blood is suddenly liberated by the reduction of pressure. The consequence, if the bubbles   accumulate in a joint, is sharp pain and a bent body -- thus the name. If the bubbles form in his lungs or brain, the consequence can be death.
Other air-breathing animals also suffer this decompression   sickness if they surface too fast: whales, for example. And so, long ago, did ichthyosaurs  . That these ancient sea-animals got the bends can be seen from their bones. If bubbles of nitrogen form inside the bone they can cut off its blood supply. This kills the cells in the bone, and consequently weakens it, sometimes to the point of collapse. Fossil bones that have caved in on themselves are thus a sign that the animal once had the bends.
Bruce Rothschild of the University of Kansas knew all this when he began a suty of ichthyosaurs bones to find out how widespread the problem was in the past. What he particularly wanted to investigate was how ichthyosaurs adapted to the problem of decompession over the 150 milllion years. To this end, he and his colleagues traveled the world's natural-history museums, looking at hundreds of ichthyosaurs from the Trassic period and from the later Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
When he started, he assumed that signs of the bends would be rarer in younger fossils, reflecting their gradual evolution of measures to deal with decompression. Instead, he was astonished to discover the opposite. More than 15% of Jurassic and Cretaceous ichthyosaurs had suffered the bends before the died, but not a single Trassic specimen showed evidence of that sort of injury.
If ichthyosaurs did evolve an anti-decompression means, they clearly did so quickly -- and, most strangly, they lost it afterwards. But that is not what Dr Rothchild thinks happened. He suspects it was evolution in other animals that caused the change.
Whales that suffer the bends often do so because they have sufaced to escape a predator   such as a large shark. One of the features of the Jurassia oceans was an abundance of large sharks and crocodiles, both of which were fond of ichthyosaurs lunches. Trassic oceans, by contrast, were mercifully shark-and crocodile-free. In the Trassic, then, ichthyosaurs were top of the food chain. In the Jurrasic and Cretaceous, they were prey   as well as predator --and often had to make a speedy exit as a result.

A. confirmed his assumption 
B. speeded up his research process

Context: Are you a volcano lover? Here is a list of some of the world's most beautiful volcanoes
that our travel agency can offer you to visit. Don't miss them!
Mount Mayon, the Philippines
Located about 450 km southeast of Manila on the island of Luzon, Mount Mayon is the
most active volcano in the Philippines; a September 2014 eruption forced thousands to flee the
area. Those who hike the volcano are rewarded with views of the towns in the Albay province
and the Pacific Ocean. But even those who prefer the view from a distance have a historical
good point at the Cagsawa Ruins, once an 18th Century Franciscan church that was destroyed
by an 1814 eruption.
Kilauea and Marina Kea, Hawaii
Hawaii's volcanoes are known for their active eruptions and extraordinary scenes. Mauna Kea is around one million years old, while Kilauea is the youngest volcano in Hawaii and has
been erupting continuously since 1983. The lava falls straight into the sea, creating fantastic
forms of black rocks and smoke clouds.
Mount Kelimutu, Indonesia
Kelimutu's three mysterious crater lakes attract both scientists and tourists to the island
of Flores in Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara province. One is emerald green  , another
dark red, and the third pitch black. Scientists say the lakes take on such colors because the
volcanic gases met the lakes' minerals centuries ago. 
 Question:People who hike Mount Mayon can enjoy the following EXCEPT   _  . 
A. views of the towns in the Albay province 
B. views of the Pacific Ocean 
C. views of the Cagsawa Ruins 
D. views of Indonesia's East Nusa Tenggara province

Context: Hospital emergency rooms treat injured fingers all the time. Without treatment, a bad cut can lead to permanent damage. But how should a person know when a bleeding cut is serious enough to require medical attention? We asked Dr Martin Brown, chairman of the department of emergency medicine at Inova Alexandria Hospital in Virginia.
First, the medical term for a cut or tear in the skin is a laceration(,). Dr Brown says the length is usually not as important as the depth. He says a long cut on a finger can likely be treated without a visit to a doctor if the wound is not very deep. ""If you have a short but deep laceration where there's been a structure underneath that's been damaged - a tendon, a nerve, a blood vessel,"" says Martin, ""it may, in fact, need professional attention.""
Some injuries - like a fingertip that gets cut off - might even require surgery to repair. That requires a specialist to either file  down the bone or _ the fingertip. More often, filing down the bone is what is done because reattaching a fingertip is often not successful.
How a wound bleeds can be a sign of how serious it is. Minor cuts usually produce what is known as venous   bleeding. This means the blood flows steadily from the injury. The bleeding will often stop when pressure is put on the wound. Dr Brown says in most cases holding direct pressure with clean gauze or a cloth for four to five minutes should stop the bleeding. With a cut finger, holding the hand above the heart can reduce the loss of blood. But if a cut appears to be pumping blood out with some force, this may be a sign of arterial  bleeding. This kind of injury should be treated by a medical professional as soon as possible.
Even a cut that does not require medical attention must be kept clean to prevent infection. Small cuts should be cleaned gently with clean water. Use a washcloth to clean the area if the wound is dirty. Dr Brown says cuts should be covered with a clean, dry bandage. 
 Question:.The best title of this passage should be  _  . 
A. Hospital Emergency Treatments For Injured Fingers 
B. When a Cut Finger Is More Serious Than It Might Seem 
C. Serious Finger Cut That Requires Medical Attention 
D. Keep Finger Cuts Clean to Prevent Serious Infection 
 Answer: B
Context: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog.
Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation.
""The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,"" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery.
The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are ""extremely difficult, if not impossible"" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said.
The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face.
The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants,
Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue.
Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality
There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers.
Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant. 
 Question:The best title for the passage would be   _  . 
A. French Woman has First Partial Face Transplant 
B. First Face Transplant Opens Debate 
C. Risks and Ethical Problems of a Face Transplant 
D. A Complete Face Transplant of a French Woman

Context: One baby born with a defective windpipe   now has hope of breathing normally thanks to 3-D printing technology, NPR reported.
Garrett Peterson, now 18 months old, was born with tracheomalacia  , leaving him unable to breathe. The condition terrified his parents, who turned to specialist Dr. Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment.
Along with Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer who runs the university's 3-D printing lab, Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett's windpipe until it's strong enough to function independently. After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the ""splint"" with a 3-D printer.
""It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,"" Green told NPR.
On January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs?
Though he still remains in the hospital, Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery.  His parents are overjoyed, saying he's starting to act more interactive and alert.
As Garrett grows, the splint will expand and eventually dissolve in his body as his own windpipe strengthens enough to work independently.
3-D printing technology has allowed doctors to help patients in ways that they hope will continue to grow.
""We're talking about taking something like dust and converting it into body parts,"" Green said. ""And we're able to do things that were never possible before."" 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that   _  . 
A. Garrett is out of hospital with the help of 3-D printing technology. 
B. The splint will exist in Garrett's body for ever. 
C. It is difficult to operate the 3-D printer. 
D. Garrett's condition is critical.

Context: A mom in Australia was told by a doctor that her newborn son was ""dead"",but she helped bring him back to life  by holding the baby against her body. She used a method known as ""kangaroo care "".The child,named Jamie,was born after only 27 weeks with his twin sister,Emily,at a hospital in Sydney.Her birth went well,but his was a different story.The doctor struggled for 20 minutes to save him before declaring him dead.
""His little arms and legs were just falling down away from his body,"" Kate Ogg said.""I took my coat off and put him on my chest with his head over my arm."" She and her husband,David,spoke to the child as she continued to hold him for nearly two hours.During that time,the twopound baby showed signs of life.She said,""I told my mom,who was there,that he was still alive.Then he held out his hand and grabbed my finger.""

Context: Lee's mother Sun became unexpectedly pregnant while married to a disabled man. Doctors told her that because of a medication she had been taking her child would not be normal. She chose to continue with the pregnancy and in 1985 in Seoul, South Korea, little Hee Ah Lee was born with only two fingers on each hand, disfigurement of her legs, and slight brain injury. The hospital told Sun that she could not care for the child at home and her relatives wanted her to place the child for adoption in a foreign country. Sun, however, thought her baby would live a successful life.
When Lee was a pre-schooler, Sun wanted her daughter to take piano lessons for two reasons. One was that she felt it would help her strengthen her hands so she could hold a pencil. The other was that she felt that if she could master the piano, she could master anything. For six months piano schools turned them down and then the one teacher who did accept the task got discouraged and wanted to quit. It was a three-month contest of wills between mother and daughter that led to a conflict in which Sun actually threw her daughter on the floor in frustration. But Lee got back up on the piano bench and for the first time played a children's song. That was the turning point and one year later Lee won the grand prize in a piano concert for Kindergartners. It was at the age of 7 that Lee won Korea's 19th National Handicap Conquest Contest and was presented with her award by the President of Korea.
Lee has won numerous awards, and is a widely traveled concert pianist with more than 200 appearances. Her first album titled ""Hee-ah, a Pianist with Four Fingers"" was released in June, 2008.
Lee speaks highly of her mother for challenging her to master the piano and said that although her training was difficult, ""As time went by, the piano became my source of inspiration and my best friend.""

Context: The Segway Human Transporter was invented by Dean Kamen.It is a two-wheeled vehicle designed for a single rider standing upright over its single axle  and navigate using a set of handlebars resembling those on a bicycle.Electrically powered, it could travel over 15 miles on a single charge and reach speeds up to twelve miles per hour.Its speed and direction can be controlled by riders' changing their weights.
A college dropout and self-taught engineer, Kamen already held over 100 patents for his inventions when he developed the one he hoped would revolutionize short-distance travel.While still in college, Kamen started developing the medical devices   that made his name.Later, he changed focus to the challenges faced by wheelchair users.His robotic wheelchair known as IBOT could climb stairs.This robot ended up paving the way for the Segway.
Before showing his most recent invention, Kamen had kept it a top secret for months.When it turned out to be little more than a motor scooter, many publicly expressed their disappointment.On closer examination, however, even his critics  had to admit that the vehicle was an engineering achievement.It answered the prayers of anyone who is worn out when walking downtown.Not everyone welcomed the Segway's arrival, though.Some complained it was too expensive, while others said it would further weaken the average American ' s fitness.A Japanese inventor even accused Kamen of stealing the idea for the Segway from him.
Despite the controversy, the U.S.postal service began using Kamen's invention a month after its appearance, and a factory was built with plans to produce about 40,000 Segways every month.The argument is still on whether the Segway will be remembered as the greatest invention since the light bulb, or just another forgettable electronic device.Anyway, trips to the local supermarket will never be the same again. 
 Question:Which is not a feature of the Segway? 
A. One person at a time can ride on it. 
B. It has two wheels with a single axle. 
C. It is powered by electricity and can go up to 12mph. 
D. Riders increase the speed by moving the handlebars 
 Answer: D
Context: Almost every machine with moving parts has wheels, yet no one knows exactly when the first wheel was invented or what it was used for. We do know, however, that they existed over 5,500 years ago in ancient Asia.
The oldest known transport wheel was discovered in 2002 in Slovenia. It is over 5,100 years old. Evidence suggests that wheels for transport didn't become popular for a while, though. This could be because animals did a perfectly good job of carrying farming tools and humans around.
But it could also be because of a difficult situation. While wheels need to roll on smooth surfaces, roads with smooth surfaces weren't going to be constructed until there was plenty of demand for them. Eventually, road surfaces did become smoother, but this difficult situation appeared again a few centuries later. There had been no important changes in wheel and vehicle design before the arrival of modem road design.
In the mid-1700s, a Frenchman came up with a new design of road--a base layer   of large stones covered with a thin layer of smaller stones. A Scotsman improved on this design in the 1820s and a strong, lasting road surface became a reality. At around the same lime, metal hubs (the central part of a wheel) came into being, followed by the pneumatic tyre  in 1846. Alloy wheels were invented in 1967, sixty years after the appearance of tarmacked roads  . As wheel design took off, vehicles got faster and faster. 
 Question:What might explain why transport wheels didn't become popular for some time? 
A. Few knew how to use transport wheels. 
B. Humans carried farming tools just as well. 
C. Animals were a good means of transport. 
D. The existence of transport wheels was not known.

Context: A growing number of college students are applying to take entry tests for medical and dental   schools among increasing graduate unemployment in Korea.
""I've decided to apply for the test to enter a medical college to become a doctor, changing from my original plan to prepare for a lawyer qualification exam in order to get a more stable job in the future,"" said a 24-year-old college graduate, Lee, who majored in business administration during his undergraduate schooling.
The new medical and dental school system is getting popularity, attracting an increasing number of students every year since its appearance in 2004, as it is open to all college graduates regardless of their previous majors.
The Education Development introduced the new medical and dental education system, in which college students with bachelor's degrees are allowed to study medicine or dentistry by taking the Medical Education Test (MET) and Dental Education Test (DET).
Ten medical schools and six dental colleges that have used the new system have received 4,377 applications   for the entrance exams.
Applicants are getting younger compared with those in their 20s representing 76.9 percent of the total. The tests might be easier for students with biology and chemistry majors, but graduates from other majors are also applying for the tests.
Under the existing medical and dental education system, students should take a two-year premedical course followed by a four-year medical course.
Students graduating under the new medical or dental education system are given master's degrees, while those graduates who studied under the previous system have bachelor's degrees. 
 Question:Students in the old system may spend   _   years at college to get bachelor's degrees. 
A. two

""I've decided to apply for the test to enter a medical college to become a doctor, changing from my original plan to prepare for a lawyer qualification exam in order to get a more stable job in the future,"" said a 24-year-old college graduate, Lee, who majored in business administration during his undergraduate schooling.
The new medical and dental school system is getting popularity, attracting an increasing number of students every year since its appearance in 2004, as it is open to all college graduates regardless of their previous majors.
The Education Development introduced the new medical and dental education system, in which college students with bachelor's degrees are allowed to study medicine or dentistry by taking the Medical Education Test (MET) and Dental Education Test (DET).
Ten medical schools and six dental colleges that have used the new system have received 4,377 applications   for the entrance exams.
Applicants are getting younger compared with those in their 20s representing 76.9 percent of the total. The tests might be easier for students with biology and chemistry majors, but graduates from other majors are also applying for the tests.
Under the existing medical and dental education system, students should take a two-year premedical course followed by a four-year medical course.
Students graduating under the new medical or dental education system are given master's degrees, while those graduates who studied under the previous system have bachelor's degrees. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. New Medical and Dental School System Is Carried Out in Korea 
B. Korean College Students Have a New Job Choice 
C. Korean College Students Rush to Medical and Dental Schools 
D. Doctors Are Becoming Popular in Korea

Context: The _ is the tallest modern land animal. It can be over 5. 5 meters tall. Its neck alone may be 1. 9 meters long. Yet the giraffe has only seven bones in its neck, the same number as in the humans'. Even a small bird has many more bones in its neck than a tall giraffe. Each bone in a giraffe's neck is very long, while the bones in a human's neck are short. That makes the difference. A female giraffe gives birth to one baby at a time. The baby, called a calf, is about 1. 9 meters tall at birth. By the age of eight it is full-grown. The giraffe eats mostly leaves. Because it has a long neck, it can reach the high leaves on the trees.

Context: For almost forty years the Empire State Building in New York City was the world's tallest skyscraper . The building reaches a height of 1, 250 feet. It has 102 floors. The use of steel frames made its height possible. Steel walls can rise height without needing to be thick. Steel frame construction is strong. All plates are fixed firmly together by metal bolts called rivets  . When set in place, rivets are usuall red- hot. One end is already rounded. A riveter uses a special hammer to shape the other end. Then the rivet cools. It holds the plates firmly. High winds can move this strong building. A wind of a hundred miles an hour has caused it to move almost one and a half inches. 
 Question:The writer says that the Empire State Building   _  . 
A. hasn't been finished

 Answer: D
Context: Height is just one of the thousands of features your genes decide. In fact, because you have two parents, your genes provide you a height that usually lands somewhere between the height of each parent. If both your parents are tall, then most probably you will be tall, too, but if you have questions about how tall you're going to be, ask your doctor if he or she can help you find it out.
But genes don't decide everything. For example, eating an unhealthy diet can keep you from growing to your ideal height. Getting plenty of sleep and enough exercise will help you grow to the expected height.
No doubt you're wondering how fast you should grow. It depends. There's no perfect or right answer. Generally speaking, kids grow about 2 inches (6 centimeters) a year between age 3 and the time when they start puberty (when your body starts changing and becoming more grown up).
Your doctor will know how your growth has been going over the years. Two centimeters here and 2 inches there are not nearly as important as the height you're at now, how you've been growing up to this point, and what other changes your body may be going through.
Don't be scared if you seem to have grown a lot in a very short time. Everyone has a growth spurt  during puberty. The age for starting puberty is about 10 for girls and about 11 for boys. But it can be earlier or later ---between 7 and 13 for girls and 9 and 15 for boys.
You'll usually begin to notice that you're growing faster about a year or so after your body starts to show the first changes of puberty. 
 Question:This passage is mainly about   _  . 
A. how the genes work in your body 
B. when is the time you grow fast 
C. why you look like your parents 
D. how you grow to a certain height

Context: Nowadays, the food we eat seems to have great effects on our health. Although science has made enormous steps in making food more fit to eat, it has, at the same time, made many foods unfit to eat. Some research has shown that perhaps eighty percent of all human illnesses are related to diet and forty percent of cancer is related to the diet as well, especially cancer of the colon. Different cultures are more likely to cause certain different illnesses because of the food that is characteristic in these cultures.
That food is related to illness is not a new discovery. In 1945, about 68 years ago, government researchers realized that nitrates, commonly used to preserve color in meats, and other food additives, caused cancer. Yet, these carcinogenic additives remain in our food, and it becomes more difficult all the time to know which things on the packaging labels of processed food are helpful or harmful. The additives which we eat are not all so direct. Farmers often give penicillin to beef and living animals, and because of this, penicillin has been found in the milk of treated cow. Sometimes similar drugs are given to animals not for medical purposes, but for financial reasons. The farmers are simply trying to fatten the animals in order to obtain a higher price on the market. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has tried repeatedly to control these procedures, the practices continue.

Context: Health experts have long worried about the increasing rate of obesity in kids. It's an important concern: Being weight or obese during childhood can lead to serious problems normally seen in adults, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Poor diets and a lack of exercise are usually the causes. But would you ever have imagined there might be a connection between the bacteria that lived in your guts  when you were a baby and the chance that you would become overweight?
Scientists in Finland recently found just such a link. In a recent study, they showed that overweight kids had different species of bacteria living in their guts.
You probably think of bacteria only as germs that can make you sick. While it's true that some bacteria can make people ill, your body actually depends on some types of bacteria to help you digest food and extract nutrients from it. These ""good"" bacteria live in your guts, where they process the food you eat.
Human babies get these bacterial helpers from their moms. When a baby is born, some of the bacteria in the mother move into the baby's body. Growing babies get additional ""good"" bacteria from the milk their mothers produce. And it turns out the bacteria might play an important role in regulating weight just six years later.
So how could these bacteria affect weight? The researchers still haven't tested that question, but future tests might lead to an answer. 
 Question:The purpose of writing this passage is to   _  . 
A. introduce the role of bacteria in children's weight 
B. analyze the influence of obesity on kids 
C. give advice on how to lose weight quickly 
D. explain the function of bacteria in foods 
 Answer: A
Context: CANBERRA (Reuters Life!) - Think twice before eating those dropped crumbs off your computer keyboard -- you might as well be eating off a toilet seat, according to a new study on the amount of germs on keyboards.
A study by British ""Which? Computing"" asked a microbiologist to examine for bugs on 33 keyboards in a typical London office, a toilet seat and a toilet door handle.
Four keyboards were judged potential health hazards and the microbiologist recommended the removal of one keyboard as it had 150 times the pass limit of bacteria -- five times filthier than the swabbed toilet seat.
""Most people don't give much thought to the grime that builds up on their PC, but if you don't clean your computer, you might as well eat your lunch off the toilet,"" said Sarah Kidner, the consumer magazine editor of ""Which? Computing"" in a statement.
The study found that eating lunch at desks is the main cause of a bug-infested keyboard. Dropped crumbs and food encourages the growth of millions of bacteria.
Poor personal hygiene, such as not washing hands after going to the toilet, may also add to the dirtiness of keyboards.
But despite the health hazard of a dirty keyboard, a survey of 4,000 people by the magazine found one in 10 people ever cleaned their keyboard while another two in 10 never cleaned their mouse.
Almost half -- or 46 per cent -- cleaned their keyboard less than once a month.
To clear out bugs, the magazine recommends users unplug keyboards, turn them upside down and shake them. 
 Question:What do you think the expression ""Think twice before eating those dropped crumbs off your computer keyboard"" stands for? 
A. Think several times before eating beside your computer 
B. Don't drop foods onto the computer keyboard. 
C. Don't eat foods dropped onto the computer keyboard. 
D. Be careful when you are eating by the computer.

Context: Only about 30 percent of people in the US know how to perform CPR  . Recently, a 9-year-old boy showed a Georgia woman how to perform CPR on her newborn baby.
Susanna Rohm said she had experienced a parent's worst nightmare   -- her 2-month-old son, Isiah, was not breathing. ""I noticed he looked pale. I looked at his arms and his legs and they were limp  ,"" Rohm told a local newspaper. ""Then I noticed that he looked like he wasn't alive."" In _ , she dropped and broke her cellphone. Rohm had to run into the street, screaming for help.
""I had him in my arms and screamed over and over. Then I ran outside. I saw two boys playing across the street, and I yelled, 'Go and ask your parents to call 911,'"" Rohm said. But the two boys were able to do more than that. Nine-year-old Ethan Wilson took action, showing Rohm how to perform CPR on little Isiah while ten-year-old Rocky Hurt helped as well.
Rocky said he had learned the CPR technique from a poster in a health class at their school, Sedalia Park Elementary. ""I was thinking we'd better give her a helping hand instead of getting scared,"" Ethan said. ""I told her to push on the baby's chest five to ten times a minute with only two fingers, tilt back the baby's head, plug the baby's nose and breathe into the baby's mouth,"" Ethan said in an interview.
At last, Isiah began crying and was breathing again. He spent two nights in a local hospital. ""If the little boy hadn't shown me what to do right there, my baby would probably not be alive right now,"" Rohm said. 
 Question:What did Rohm do when she saw the two boys? 
A. She asked them to call 911 as soon as possible. 
B. She asked them to teach her how to perform CPR. 
C. She asked them to ask their parents for help. 
D. She asked them to help her perform CPR on her baby.

Context: Joanne was stuck in a traffic jam in central Birmingham at 5:30 and at 6:30 she was expected to be chairing a meeting of the tennis club. At last, the traffic was moving. She swung quickly racing to her house. As she opened the door , she nearly tripped over  Sheba.
""Hey, Sheba,"" she said, ""I've got no time for you now, but I'll take you out as soon as I get back from tennis club."" Then she noticed Sheba seemed to be coughing or choking. Obviously, she could hardly breathe. Immediately, Joanne realized she would have to take her to the vet  .
When she got there, the vet was just about to close for the day. Seeing the state of Sheba, Dr. Sterne brought her quickly into his office.
""Listen, doctor, I'm really in a rush to get to a meeting, can I leave her with you, and go and get changed? I'll be back in ten minutes to pick her up, and then I'll take her on to the meeting with me. Is that OK?""
""Sure."" said the doctor.
Joanne made the quick trip back to her house in a couple of minutes. As she was once more entering the hallway, the phone by the door began to ring.
""This is Dr. Sterne,"" said an anxious voice. ""I want you to get out of that house immediately, ""said the doctor's voice. ""I'm coming round right away, and the police will be there any time now. Wait outside!""
At that moment, a police car screeched  to a stop outside the house. Two policemen got out and ran into the house. Joanne was by now completely confused and very frightened. Then the doctor arrived.
""Where's Sheba? Is she OK?"" shouted Joanne.
""She's fine, Joanne. I took out the thing which was choking her, and she's OK now. ""
Just then, the two policemen reappeared from the house, half-carrying a white--faced man, who could hardly walk. There was blood all over him.
""My God, "" said Joanne, ""how did he get in there? And how did you know he was there?""
""I think he must be a burglar."" said the doctor. ""I knew he was there because when I finally removed what was stuck in Sheba's throat:it turned out to be three human fingers."" 
 Question:Joanne wanted to get back to her home again   _   .            . 
A. to dress up for the meeting 
B. to phone the police station 
C. to catch the badly hurt burglar

Context: One baby born with a defective windpipe   now has hope of breathing normally thanks to 3-D printing technology, NPR reported.
Garrett Peterson, now 18 months old, was born with tracheomalacia  , leaving him unable to breathe. The condition terrified his parents, who turned to specialist Dr. Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment.
Along with Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer who runs the university's 3-D printing lab, Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett's windpipe until it's strong enough to function independently. After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the ""splint"" with a 3-D printer.
""It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,"" Green told NPR.
On January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs?
Though he still remains in the hospital, Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery.  His parents are overjoyed, saying he's starting to act more interactive and alert.
As Garrett grows, the splint will expand and eventually dissolve in his body as his own windpipe strengthens enough to work independently.
3-D printing technology has allowed doctors to help patients in ways that they hope will continue to grow.
""We're talking about taking something like dust and converting it into body parts,"" Green said. ""And we're able to do things that were never possible before."" 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that   _  . 
A. Garrett is out of hospital with the help of 3-D printing technology. 
B. The splint will exist in Garrett's body for ever. 
C. It is difficult to operate the 3-D printer. 
D. Garrett's condition is critical.

Context: Read the following interview with Dr John Bass, an international shark  specialist who has spent many years studying sharks:
First of all, doctor, are all sharks dangerous?
  No, they aren't. There are about 250 different kinds of sharks, but fewer than 30 of them are dangerous to humans. Certain sharks are very aggressive   and we should fear them, but the danger of shark attacks is much lower than most people think.
  So which sharks are dangerous?
  The Great White shark is the most dangerous. Then there is the Tiger shark, which other sharks are afraid of, and the Blue shark. Both of them are very fast and dangerous.
  Which are the biggest and smallest sharks?
  The Whale shark is the biggest shark in the world. It grows up to 15 m in length and weighs as much as six large cars. The smallest shark, which is found near prefix = st1 /Japan, could fit into the palm of your hand because it is only 15-20 cm long.
  Do all sharks have teeth ?
  Yes, they do. Most sharks have hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of sharp teeth. These are arranged in rows of four or more. They fit quite loosely in the jaw. When the front ones break off or fall out, spare teeth move forwards from the rows behind: Sharks get a new set of teeth every two weeks. In 10 years, a Tiger may lose as many as 24,000 teeth!
  That's lots of teeth! What kind of food do sharks eat?
  Most sharks feed on small fish, and they keep the oceans healthy by eating sick and injured fish. However, hungry sharks will eat almost anything, including smaller sharks and even rubbish. Inside one Tiger shark which was found, there was a tin can, a bicycle tyre , a leather wallet and an alarm clock!
  And how do sharks find their food, doctor?
  A shark's sense of smell is excellent. It will follow the smell of blood across thousands of metres of ocean. They also see well, and they have good hearing. Sharks can feel movement in water very easily too, and it is possible for them to feel a fish moving as far as 30 m away. 
 Question:Most types of sharks are   _  . 
A. dangerous killers 
B. not dangerous 
C. afraid of people 
D. found inJapan

I'd thought I could hold out till my dentist came back from holiday,but the pain was really unbearable. I started calling the dentists in the phone book,but no one could see me immediately. Finally,at about lunchtime,I got lucky.
""If you come by right now,""the receptionist said,""the dentist will fit you in.""
I took my purse and keys and rushed to my car. But suddenly I began to doubt about the dentist. What kind of dentist would be so eager to treat someone at such short notice?Why wasn't he as busy as the others?
In the dentist's office,I sat down and looked around. I saw nothing but the bare walls and I became even more worried. The assistant noticed my nervousness and placed her warm hand over my icecold one.
When I told her my fears,she laughed and said,""Don't worry. The dentist is very good.""
""How long do I have to wait for him?""I asked impatiently.
""Come on,he is coming. Just lie down and relax. And enjoy the artwork,""the assistant said.
""The artwork?""I was puzzled.
The chair went back. Suddenly I smiled. There was a beautiful picture,right where I could enjoy it:on the ceiling. How considerate the dentist was!At that moment,I began to understand what my friend meant by her words.  What a relief!

Context: Perhaps it is hard to imagine that a bad tooth could be deadly. But doctors in the Washington area say a twelveyearold boy died last month of a tooth infection that spread to his brain. They say it might have been prevented if the boy had received the dental care he needed.
Experts at the National Institutes of Health say good dental care should start at birth. They say breast milk is the best food for the healthy development of teeth. Breast milk can help slow bacterial growth and acid production in the mouth.
When baby's teeth begin to appear,you can clean them with a wet toothbrush. Dentists say it is important to find soft toothbrushes made especially for babies,and use them very gently.
The use of fluoride   to protect teeth is common in many parts of the world. This natural element is often added to drinking water supplies. The fluoride mixes with enamel ,the hard surface on teeth,to help prevent holes,or cavities from forming.
But the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry points out that young children often swallow toothpaste when they brush their teeth. The group notes that swallowing fluoridated toothpaste can cause problems. So young children should be carefully supervised when they brush their teeth. And only a small amount of fluoridated toothpaste,the size of a green pea,should be used.
Parents often wonder what effects sucking a thumb or sucking on a pacifier might have on their baby's teeth. Dental experts generally agree that this is fine early in life.
The American Academy of Family Physicians says most kids stop sucking their thumbs by the age of four. If it continues,the group advises parents to talk to their child's dentist or doctor. It could influence the correct development of permanent teeth. 
 Question:The boy with a bad tooth died because  _  . 
A. his tooth disease was very deadly 
B. the doctor refused to treat him properly 
C. he didn't receive timely treatment 
D. something was wrong with his brain

Context: Brush your teeth every day, dentists say. In the south of Africa, some people brush their teeth all day long.
They keep a small stick in their mouth to chew or scrub   their teeth all day. People cut the sticks from trees. They are the African toothbrushes. People there are used to brushing their teeth with sticks.
Africans think the sticks work better than toothbrushes. The sticks come from nature, and it is said that there is something special about them. The special thing may stop many kinds of tooth problems. ""If you have a bad tooth, it is a medicine,"" said Diop, a seller in Africa.
The sticks are also much cheaper than toothbrushes.
In Senegal  ,the chewing stick is called ""sothio"". It means ""to clean"" in their language. In east Africa,the stick is called ""mswaki"". It's their word for ""toothbrush"".
Even the dentists agree that the sticks seem to clean teeth better. Nowadays, some nice health stores in the United States start to sell chewing sticks. They think that the stick is natural kind of tooth care. 
 Question:When do the people in the south of Africa brush teeth with sticks? 
A. In the morning. 
B. In the afternoon. 
C. In the evening. 
D. All day.

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle? 
 Answer: A
Context: Fish have ears. Really. They're quite small and have no opening to the outside world carrying sound through the body. For the past seven years, Simon Thorrold, a university professor, has been examining fish ears, small round ear bones called otoliths.
As fish grow, so do their otoliths. Each day, their otoliths gain a ring of calcium carbonate  . By looking through a microscope and counting these rings, Thorrold can determine the exact age of a young fish. As a fish gets older, its otoliths no longer get daily rings. Instead, they get yearly rings, which can also be counted, giving information about the fish's age, just like the growth rings of a tree.
Ring counting is nothing new to fish scientists. But Thorrold has turned to a new direction. They're examining the chemical elements   of each otolith ring.
The daily ring gives us the time, but chemistry tells us about the environment in which the fish swam on any given day. These elements tell us about the chemistry of the water that the fish was in. It also says something about water temperature, which determines how much of these elements will gather within each otolith ring.
Thorrold can tell, for example, if a fish spent time in the open ocean before entering the less salty water of coastal areas. He can basically tell where fish are spending their time at any given stage of history.
In the case of the Atlantic croaker, a popular saltwater food fish, Thorrold and his assistant have successfully followed the travelling of young fish from mid-ocean to the coast, a journey of many hundreds of miles.
This is important to managers in the fish industry, who know nearly nothing about the track of the young fish for most food fish in the ocean. Eager to learn about his technology, fish scientists are now lending Thorrold their ears. 
 Question:Why does the writer compare the fish to trees? 
A. Trees gain a growth ring each day. 
B. Trees also have otoliths. 
C. Their growth rings are very small. 
D. They both have growth rings.

Context: Darek Fidyka, a 38-year-old Bulgarian, had been paralyzed   from the chest down for four years after a knife attack. Scientists from Britain and Poland took cells from his nose, transplanted   them into his back and re-grew his spinal cord  . Now he can walk and even drive a car. The doctors were delighted but said it was the first step in a long journey.
The breakthrough came after 40 years of research by Professor Geoff Raisman, who found that cells had the possibility to repair damage to nasal   nerves, the only part of the nervous system that constantly re-grows. ""The idea was to take something from an area where the nervous system can repair itself and put it into an area that doesn't repair itself,"" Professor Raisman said.
Polish doctors injected   the nasal cells into Mr Fidyka's spinal cord above the injury and used some nerves from his ankle to form a bridge across the damaged tissue. The nasal cells appear to have caused the spinal nerves to repair themselves.
Professor Raisman achieved this with rats in the late 1990's, but this is his greatest success. ""I think the moment of discovery for me was Christmas in 1997 when I first saw a rat, which couldn't control its hand, put its hand out to me. That was an exciting moment, because I realized then that my belief that the nervous system could be repaired was true.""
Doctors chose the easiest case for their first attempt--it might not work for others. But there is a real sense of hope that an idea once thought impossible has been realized.
David Nicholls, who helped provide money for the breakthrough, said information about the breakthrough would be made available to researchers across the globe.
""What you've got to understand is that for three million paralyzed people in the world today, the world looks a totally brighter place than it did yesterday,"" he said. 
 Question:What made Professor Geoff Raisman begin to believe the nervous system can be repaired? 
A. His former study with other people. 
B. His operation on a paralyzed patient. 
C. His sudden thought about Christmas. 
D. His unusual experience with a sick rat.

Context: There are various reasons why cancers appear to be on the increase. For one thing, though their sufferers are to be found in all age groups, cancers are particularly likely to attack persons in their middle and advanced years. Naturally, since people live longer these years, there are more cancer sufferers than before. Again, with better methods of diagnosis  , doctors can more easily recognize cancerous growths that would formerly have passed unnoticed or that would have been wrongly diagnosed. It is also believed that certain habits and conditions of modern living, including heavy smoking and the pollution of the air, may leave people living in more cancer-causing conditions than before.
We all look forward to the day when a simple medical test can find cancer while it is still small. Researchers around the world are working on _ . Most of their work deals with the examination of the blood.
Researchers in Boston have found something in the blood of cancer patients that does not appear in healthy persons. The test showed which persons had cancer and which did not. It was correct more than 90 percent of the time.
The researchers believe the test may be able to show cancer very clearly in its development. Cancers discovered early usually can be treated successfully.
The test examines very small bits of fat in the blood called lipids  . Cancers seem to change lipids although doctors do not know why. The test showed differences between the lipids of the persons with cancer and the lipids of those without cancer.
The researchers say the new test could be a step to develop a simple way to check patients for cancer before the disease shows on an X-ray. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. A simple way to cancer 
B. Cancers can be cured 
C. How to find cancer 
D. Early discovery of cancer

Context: While some scientists overlook the existence of a sixth sense for danger, a new research from Washington University in St. Louis has discovered a brain area that clearly acts as an early warning system and helps us adjust our behavior to avoid dangerous situations.
""Our brains are better at picking up not obvious warning signs than we previously thought,"" said Joshua Brown, a PhD in psychology in the issue of the journal Science.
The findings offer exact scientific evidence for a new way to form a concept of the complex control processes taking place in and around the ACC, a brain area located near the top of the frontal lobes  and along the walls that divide the left and right hemispheres .
""In the past, we found activity in the ACC when people had to make a difficult decision, or after they make a mistake,"" Brown said. ""But now we find that this brain area can actually learn to recognize when you might make a mistake, even before a difficult decision has to be made. So the ACC appears to act as an early warning system---- it learns to warn us in advance when our behavior might lead to a negative outcome, so that we can be more careful and avoid making a mistake.""
By providing a clearer picture by which we self monitor and control our behavior, the study is an important step in efforts to develop more effective treatments for mental illnesses. It also provides a new way of understanding inappropriate behaviors that often accompany mental illnesses.
""Our results suggest how injury of the ACC can lead to breakdowns in the early warning system, so that the brain fails to stop or control inappropriate behavior ahead of time,"" said Brown. ""On the other hand, in those persons with mental disorder, the ACC might warn us of an upcoming problem even when no problem is in the existence.""
Known to be an important part of the brain's control system, the ACC is believed to help adjust between cold, hard, fact-based reasoning and emotional responses, such as love, fear or expectation. 
 Question:The new research helps us understand   _  . 
A. why we are likely to make mistakes when the ACC is badly injured 
B. why people with illnesses usually have so many strange behaviors 
C. how the ACC works when something dangerous happens 
D. how our brain warns us of failure in advance

Context: Some people are like homing pigeons; Drop them off anywhere.and they'll find their way around.Other people.through, can't tell holding a map upside down.Are the directionally challenged just bad learners?
Not all of your navigational skills are learned.Research shows that your sense of direction is innate.An innate ability is something you are born with.Your brain has special navigational neurons--head-direction cells, place cells, and grid cells --and they help program your inside compass when you're just a baby.
In 2010.scientists carried out an experiment to study baby rates'    activity in their brains.Although the rats were newborns.the researchers discovered that their head-direction cells(which help them recognize the direction they're facing) were fully grown and developed.The rats.it seemed.were born with a sense of direction.And they hadn't even opened their eyes yet!
Humans.of course, are not rats.But the hippocampus --the brain we use for navigation--is similar in most mammals.If the rat's compass develops this way.then it's likely a human's compass does, too.
If we're born with a sense of direction.then why are some people so good at getting lost? The scientists found that the two other cells---place and grid cells--developed within the first month.Place cells are thought to help us form a map in our mind.while gird cells help us navigate new and unfamiliar places.The two cells work together, and that's where the trouble might be.
People who took part in a 2013 study played a video game that required them to travel quickly between different places.Monitoring their brains.the scientists.According to researcher Michael Kahana, differences in how gird cells work may help explain why some people have a better sense of direction than others. 
 Question:What do we know about our navigational neurons? 
A. Place cells let us know how to read a map 
B. Grid cells help us reach the place we are going to 
C. They help us use a compass when we lose our way

Context: Are you carrying too much on your back to school? I'm sure lots of your age will say ""Yes"". Not only the students in China have this problem, but children in the United States also have heavy school bags. 
Doctors are starting to worry about that younger and younger students are having problems as a result of school bags being too heavy for them.
""It's hard for me to go upstairs with my bag because it's so heavy,"" said Rich Hammond, an 11-year-old student in the US.
Rich is among students who have common school bags with two straps to carry them, but many other choose rolling   bags. But even with rolling bags, getting up stairs and houses is still a problem for children. Many of them have hurt backs and necks because of the heavy school bags.
But how much is too much? Doctors say students should carry no more than 10% to 15% of their own body weight. Scott Bautch, a black doctor, said children under Grade 4 should stay with 10%. But it is also important that older children don't stay with over 15%, because their bodies are still growing. ""Children are losing their balance and falling down with their school bags,"" he said.
Parents and teachers are starting to tell children to only take home library books that they will be reading at night. Some teachers are using pieces of paper or thin workbooks for students to take home. 
One of the best answers is, as some children said, to have no homework at all. 
 Question:From the passage we can learn that  _  . 
A. only children in China carry too heavy school bags 
B. children in other countries don't carry too heavy school bags 
C. both children in China and the US carry too heavy school bags 
D. only children in the US carry too heavy school bags

Context: Most children have ever heard their parents yell ""sit up straight!"" or ""don't hang your head !"" when they eat dinner. Nowadays, it is also heard around another activity -- video games. Ten-year-old Owaish admits it takes him three to four hours a day to play games on his tablet computer. In addition, he plays for about two hours on the smart phone every day. As a result, he started suffering a serious pain in the neck around June or July. What's worse the pain has spread to the hand and back gradually, which makes his mother Mehzabin become concerned.
The doctors note the number of young children with the chronic pain  in their necks, arms and shoulders is on the increase sharp in recent years . They are not aging, they haven't had an accident, the blood reports are fine, their X-rays are fine, and their MRIs are fine. Facts have proved that the pain is from the poor posture  while they are playing video games on smart phones or other electronic devices. 19-year -old student Nida feels pain in the finger which holds the weight of her smart phone most of the day. Nida almost uses her smart phone 24/7, which means 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or all the time.
Health experts predict there will be not only physical but mental  problems resulting from the overuse of electronic devices. They encourage people to often take breaks and exercise from using computers, smart phones or other devices. Stand up! Stretch  the legs, back, shoulders and arms in all the possible directions. That's the most effective way and maybe the key to solving the problem completely. After all, the medication doesn't help sometimes.

Context: A Concussion  happens when the brain is shaken, often in a car crash or a fall or a strike on; the head in sports.Concussions can be mild, but doctors may order a CT scan to look for a more serious injury.But a recent study warned that more children than necessary are being exposed  to radiation this way.
A national team led by two doctors at the University of California, Davis, studied hospital records from thousands of children with head injuries. They found that in many cases, the risk of developing cancer from the radiation outweighed the risk of a serious brain injury.
The study found that one in five children over age two had a low risk of serious injury but received CT scans anyway. The same was true of almost one in four children under two years of age.
The researchers have developed rules to predict if a head injury is serious enough for a scan. For children under two, doctors are advised against it if there is:
*Normal mental activity.
*No swelling in the back of the head.
*No feeling of a broken bone in the skull.  
*And no loss of consciousness for more than five seconds.
Doctors should also consider how the child was injured and whether the parents say the child is acting normally.
For patients from two to eighteen, the guidelines are similar ---- except there should be no l vomiting and no severe headache.
Earlier this year, the British Journal of Sports Medicine published new guidelines for concussions in children and teens. International experts said they should not return to sports or school until fully recovered. The brain also needs a ""cognitive rest,"" they say, by restricting activities like video games, texting and watching TV.
It often take longer than adults to recover from a concussion than adults. The experts say individual progress and not a set time period should always guide a decision to return to play. 
 Question:How many aspects should doctors consider when deciding whether a child under two needs a CT scan? 
A. Four. 
B. Six. 
C. Seven. 
D. Nine.

Context: An increase in the number of suicides in prefix = st1 /South Korea, has led policeman Yoo Byoung-jong to a new job. He patrols  Seoul's bridges to stop desperate people from throwing themselves into the river.
According to South Korea's health ministry, suicide rates have doubled in a decade and are now the leading cause of death for people in their 20s and 30s.
The country has the fourth-highest suicide rate among the 30 industrialized countries in the Organization for Co-operation and Development (OECD). It recorded 22.8 suicide deaths for every 100,000 people in 2003. That's lower than Hungry, Finlandand close neighbourJapan. But the number is growing by about 1 percent each year, faster than for all other OECD nations.
In a move to cut suicides by a fifth by 2010, the health ministry is running a television ad campaign. It opens with a lonely man walking on a bridge. A voice over says: ""Think five minutes more before you give it all away. Don't forget you have a loving family.""
Other ministry plans include setting up more hotlines and training more suicide counselors. Authorities are also limiting websites that provide suicide methods and sometimes even sell toxic  chemicals.
    Distressed individuals range from students worried about poor grades to people in debt as well as disgraced politicians.
    Experts say the rising toll  in some way can be blamed on media coverage of recent high-profile suicides. These include top business leaders and celebrities  who apparently lead a number of people to copy their actions.
    ""We saved 50 lives this year when people turned to bridges as a place to die after news reports of such deaths by 'big shots',"" said the 38-year-oldYoo, in December.
    Last July, the government and civil associations urged media to avoid reporting specific methods and locations of suicides. But it is difficult to clearly give reasons for the suicide increase. 
 Question:The passage is mainly about    . 
A. suicide problems in Korea 
B. how to reduce suicides in Korea 
C. desperation 
D. the relations between life and suicide 
 Answer: A
Context: Growing up, I knew I was different. My father had left and he never came back. As I later discovered, the abandonment triggered my anxiety attacks. I feared being alone, unwanted, unpopular, and unloved.
My first attack came in a ninth-grade class: The teacher asked me to walk in front of the class, but I couldn't do it- I was soaked in sweat, shaking. My symptoms began every morning from the moment when I stepped inside the school building.
Throughout my childhood, I was no stranger to the doctor's office. My mother tried everything she could in hope of a breakthrough. There were times I thought suicide could be the only way to make the pain stop.
By age 16, I had shut down socially. Most of my peers were going to parties, playing sports, and dating. But I was a prisoner in my own home.
Then one Sunday morning, my wake-up call came from a magazine article. Freddie Prinze, Jr. was on the cover. The article detailed the pain of losing his father at a young age. I felt as though I were reading my own life story. The only difference? He was now a success.
That article inspired me to explore a new treatment option for myself. I wanted to turn my life around as well. So I hit the library and the Internet, and I began to realize how my negative thoughts controlled my physical well-being.
Immediately, I made a plan to take charge of my life. Shortly after following the items I had listed, I was able to stop seeing a therapist. I never returned to high school, but I did go to college. After graduation, I pursued a career in television news. My relationships have changed for the better, too. I've made new friends and reconnected with many from my past
The anxiety isn't completely gone, but whenever it returns, I know the feeling will pass, and know I have the power to change my life, only if I will give myself a chance. 
 Question:The writer wrote this story to tell us  _  . 
A. anxiety attacks are not lasting if we have proper treatment 
B. we shouldn't keep ourselves away from the outside world 
C. we can change our lives if we give ourselves a chance 
D. fathers are not supposed to abandon their small kids

Context: In late March,Southwest University became the first school in China to open a 24-hour hotline providing suicide-prevention counseling.    
    College suicide is a heart-breaking and argumentative topic.Chinese college students have long been the focus of public attention:their youth,education and,most importantly, bright futures make them the envy of society.
    However, in recent years,we've read more reports of student suicides.Perhaps that's  simply because of society's attention with youth.But it could also signify the increasing troubled mental state of college students.
    Many studies have sought to find out the causes of student suicides.Not surprisingly, the top factors usually include psychological and physical sickness,emotional trouble and peer pressure. Despair about their futures is also quickly becoming a leading factor:Many students say they feel hopeless and confused about the direction of their careers in a crowded job market.    
    Thankfully, more and more universities and colleges are providing counseling services to address students'mental and psychological problems.These at least offer some comfort to students facing tough job prospects and personal difficulties.
  From appointing in-house student counselors to setting up hotlines and recruiting students to help their troubled peers.many universities are making efforts to fight student depression.There is no denying that much remains to be done,but such efforts are already working,helping students and saving lives.   
  However, the most important front in this battle lies with the students themselves.Whatever efforts school officials make,it is up to students to realize their problems and ask help.Unfortunately, many students considering suicide refuse to seek help.By shutting themselves away, they can easily fall into vicious cycles ,becoming ever more vulnerable to.personal difficulties and the pressures of the outside world.     
    While establishing better on-campus psychological education and outreach programs are a step forward,students themselves must actively reach out for help.These dangers are a reality for every student not only those who feel confused and depressed. 
 Question:Which of the following is WRONG according to the article? 
A. No university had a whole day hotline providing suicide-prevention counseling before March. 
B. Many people envy the college students their bright futures. 
C. The students who feel confused and depressed may have psychological problems and need psychological education. 
D. The problems of student suicides indicate the increasing troubled mental state of young people..

Context: Recently hand-foot-mouth disease has spread across China. In the past three months, there have been about 41,846 cases   in 30 provinces and regions. The number is increasing. Eighteen Chinese children have died of the disease so far this year.
What causes the disease and why is it dangerous?
Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common childhood illness. It mainly affects children under the age of 10. It gets its name from the rash   that develops on the hands and feet. It can also cause blisters   in your mouth.
A child who has the disease will usually have a fever, a runny nose and sore throat. He or she doesn't want to eat or drink because of pain in the mouth.
Hand-foot-mouth disease is mostly not serious. The fever and rash clear within a few days. But in some cases, the virus   affects the heart, lungs or brain. This puts the child's life in danger.
A virus causes hand-foot-mouth disease. The disease spreads easily where a lot of young children are together, such as in a child-care center. Sometimes it can also affect teenagers and adults.
In order not to pass on the virus, good hygiene   is important. We should wash our hands as often as possible. Especially we should wash our hands before meals and after going to the toilet. 
 Question:_   can help us to keep away from the hand-foot-mouth disease. 
A. Passing on the virus 
B. Taking children to the child-care center 
C. Keeping your hands clean 
D. Not going to public places 
 Answer: C

Context: Why should ear, nose, tongue and eyes be called special senses? The basic reason is that these are the channels through which we maintain contact with the surroundings. Though apparently it may feel like these are individual sensory organs, they do show some connections. Interestingly, our hearing is less sharp after we eat a heavy food. Isn't it good for a sound nap after a stomach-full meal? That does not mean we go deaf after a heavy meal, but the hearing pitch does change after that.
We usually owe it to our tongue that we have taste, but do you know that unless saliva dissolves something, our tongue cannot recognize the taste of the food eaten. Taste is nothing but the food chemicals dissolved in the saliva being sensed by the taste buds present on the tongue. Try to dry off your tongue and mouth with a tissue paper and then taste something.
Woman are much better smellers than man. They are born with this characteristic ability and can correctly make out the exact fragrance of the sample. We all can store almost 50,000 different scents, which are strongly tied to the memories.
Pupils  do not respond to light alone, but to the slightest bit of noise around too. Thus surgeons, watchmakers and those professionals who have to perform a very delicate job do prefer to have a sound-free environment. Even a small noise can enlarge their pupils, change the focus and make them see less clearly.
Each and every one of us has an individualistic or characteristic smell, which is unique to us, except for the identical twins. This smell isn't very noticeable yet can be sensed even by a newborn. It may be due to this scent that the newborn recognizes the presence of his parents around. Many of us can point out the smell of our significant friends and colleagues. This is guided, to a great degree, by genetics but it is also influenced by the environment, diet and so on. This all together creates the unique chemistry that is individualistic for each person. 
 Question:What makes each person different from anyone else except for twins according to the passage? 
A. The particular smell of a person. 
B. The characteristics of a person. 
C. The style of one's behavior. 
D. The ability to distinguish various scents.

Context: Plants need green leaves to make food. A plant needs sunlight and carbon dioxide  from the air for making food and it also needs water and salts from the soil to make food too. There are certain cells   in the leaves which change carbon dioxide and water into sugar. To do this the cells needs energy, which they get from the sunlight.
Green leaves make food for the whole plant. A red leaf can make food too because under the red color1ing of the leaf there are food----making cells. There are no leaves which are completely yellow, for they can't make food.
The plant makes sugar for its food. In sunlight green leaves make a lot of sugar. The veins   can't carry all this sugar away, so the leaves change the sugar into starch  , which is kept and so stored in the leaves. At night, the starch changes back to sugar. It is then carried away from the leaves. Some of the sugar is used as food by the plant while the rest is stored as starch. In some plants, food is stored in the roots, in others it is stored in the stem   and in leaves, fruits and seeds. 
 Question:Sugar is made for its food by   _  . 
A. sunlight 
B. veins 
C. stems 
D. green leaves

Context: Pieter has a reasonable excuse for his lost wedding ring: a crocodile  ate it, along with part of his left arm. "" It took my wedding ring. I think it ate the ring up. "" He told a newspaper by telephone from his hospital as he recalled his struggle with a man-eating animal.
"" I took my horse for an evening swim in one of the farm dams. There are lots of crocodiles and hippos  in the area and they move around all the time,from dam to dam and into the river and out again. I was on the lookout for hippos and didn't see any. It slipped my mind that there might be crocodiles,"" he said.
He was standing in the water about 5 metres away from the shore when he felt a biting jolt  in his left hip. He thought it was a hippo but quickly realized it was a crocodile.
"" I started to fight immediately. I hit the crocodile with my left arm and then it went for ray left forearm. It pulled me under the water for a few seconds. I realized if I didn't stand up my wife would never find me again. What I didn't realize at the time was that the crocodile let me go because it had taken part of my left arm off,'' said Pieter.

Context: When a caterpillar   feeds on a tomato leaf , the plant moves rapidly to meet with a defensive response , systematically releasing "" proteinase inhibitors "" -- proteins that interfere   with the caterpillar's digestion -- throughout the plant , especially in the leaves .  But how does the message get from the wounded leaf to the rest of the plant ?
       Most scientists believed the alarm was spread by chemical messengers until a team of researchers headed by David Weldon-- a biologist at the University of East Anglia in Norwich , England -- made a shocking discovery .  An injured leaf , the researchers found , sends an electrical signal to warn neighboring leaves of upcoming danger . It's a "" terribly tiny current "" driven by an electrical potential difference of only 20 millvolts   , says Weldon , who measured the voltage after electrodes were attached to the plant's surface .  
       "" Right now , all we can say is that there is a correlation , "" Weldon notes . "" If you wound the plant , you'll see an electrical signal accompanied by a biochemical response . "" To learn more about the reaction , Weldon's team plans to insert electrodes within the pant tissue ( rather than on the surface ) to determine what's going on at the cellular level . The findings may help explain other mysteries surrounding plants . For example , many plants start to flower in springtime , as days grow longer , but plants sense the change in the day length through their leaves , while flowers begin to bloom at the buds   .  "" There must be a signal from the leaf to the growing points , "" Weldon says . "" So far , no one has come up with a convincing chemical mechanism . Maybe an electrical signal is involved . "" 
 Question:What is the function of the "" proteinase inhibitors "" in tomato plants ? 
A. They create nutritional matter 
B. They produce electrical signals 
C. They protect the plant from insects 
D. They cure diseases by changing chemicals 
 Answer: C
Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle?

Context: Australian sleep researchers have developed a set of hi-tech ""sunglasses"", described as the world's first ""time control"" glasses, which can imitate sunlight patterns. The team, from Flinders University, in Adelaide, says the glasses send out a soft green glow that helps a traveller adapt to changing sleep patterns and time zones in ""small steps"". It targets a part of the brain that regulates the human body-clock, by sending signals to the rest of the body that help it slowly realise it is in a different area of the world. It has been suggested the device, called the ""Re-Timer"", is currently the only wearable body clock adjustment system commercially available.
Scientists say the device, officially launched in South Australia, can help ridf the negative effects of long-timel travel and bring new relief to insomnia  sufferers, shift workers and even teenagers.
""The light from Re-Timer stimulates the part of the brain responsible for regulating the 24-hour body clock,"" said Prof Leon Lack, its chief inventor.
Extensive research has shown that green light is one of the most effective wavelengths  for influencing the body clock.
The battery-powered device, which retail for PS162 in Britain, then sends signals that cause the production of hormones and daily cycles known as circadian rhythms .
Those people who want to sleep peacefully, but wake earlier, should wear it for 50 minutes in the morning for three days. Those who want a lie- in, should wear it for the same time before bed to delay the body clock. The device, which is powered by an inbuilt rechargeable battery, can also be worn as sunglasses during daily tasks such as reading or using a computer.
""The glasses have been designed to be user friendly and comfortable to wear so people can go about their normal activities wearing them at work or at home,"" he said, adding they had been designed based on 25 years of university research.
It is estimated that up to 94 per cent of long-time travellers suffer from jet lag because the body becomes confused to travelling through different time zones. So the glasses are good news to them. It uses the outside world as indicators as to whether it should be awake or asleep including factors such as light, silence or noise.
Airlines are said to be seeking a ""silver bullet"" for the tiredness and confusion that often follow a long-timel flight and are in discussions to buy the device. 
 Question:What can we learn about the ""Re-Timer"" from the passage? 
A. It is a new way to cure insomnia 
B. It can only be powered by battery 
C. It can be used by several groups of people 
D. It is specially designed for flight passengers. 
 Answer: C
Context: Our body clock,or natural body rhythm,influences our energy and alertness.Paying attention to it can help us choose the suitable time of day when we best perform specific tasks.
The reality,however,is that most of us organize their time around work demands,school deadlines,commuting or social events.Doing whatever your body feels like doing is a luxury in today's fast-paced modem society.
But that doesn't mean it isn't worth trying.Obeying our body clock has significant health benefits.Disrupting our natural body rhythm,on the other hand,has been linked to problems such as depression,obesity,or headache,says Steve Key,a biology professor.
When the body clock can synchronize(......)the rhythms of its natural processes,it ""gives us an advantage in daily life"",says Key.
According to him,when it comes to cognitive work,most adults perform best in the late morning.As our body temperature starts to rise just before awakening in the morning and continues to increase until midday,our memory,alertness and concentration gradually improve.
However,he adds,our ability to concentrate typically starts to decrease soon thereafter.Most of us are more easily distracted between noon and 4 pm.
Alertness also tends to fall after eating a meal and sleepiness tends to peak around 2 pm,making that a good time for a nap.
Surprisingly, tiredness may increase our creative powers.For most adults,problems that require open ended thinking are often best dealt with in the evening when they are tired, according to a study in the journal Thinking & Reasoning.
When choosing a time of day to exercise,paying attention to your body clock can improve results.Physical performance is usually best from about 3 to 6 pm,says Michael Smolensky,a professor of biomedical engineering.
Of course, not everyone's body clock is the same,making it even harder to synchronize natural rhythms with daily plans.

Context: James Proud, a British businessman who settled in San Francisco launched a Twitter campaign called ""Stop DST"". Daylight Saving Time (DST) refers to the time during the summer when clocks are one hour ahead of standard time.
""Daylight saving was created to save energy, and it doesn't really do that."" Proud said, ""but what's even worse are its negative health effects. It's both outdated and harmful."" daylight saving has been linked to a surprising number of health issues such as heart attacks, but Proud has a particular interest in the topic because of its disruptive  effects on sleep.
Last year, German researchers suggested that our body cocks never really adjust t daylight saving, which causes a host of health problems. Till Roenneberg of Ludwig-Maximillians University said that because of DST, ""the majority of the population has severely decreased productivity, decreased quality of life, increasing chance of getting illness, and is just plain tired.""
The week after daylight saving also witnesses a sudden increase in fatal traffic accidents, according to the University of Colorado. It is believed that this is caused both by disrupted sleep schedules and the shift of daylight hours from the morning to the evening.
""Daylight saving is an economic tradition. And all economic choices involve achieving a balance. "" said behavioral economist David Gerard. ""Even if we decide to abolish daylight saving, there would be a large number of unhappy people.""
Some such people are shift works, students and parents of schoolchildren, all of whom get to enjoy an extra hour of daylight after work or class with DST. Plus, restaurants love the extra evening sales DST allows.
Daylight saving has also been linked to lower crime rates, due to the ""deterrent effect"" of longer daylight. Basically, more light increase a criminal's chances of being seen by witnesses or police, which discourages criminal activity.
Gerard also point out that an extra hour of daylight has vastly more influence in the American South, where the sun sets earlier, even in the summer, than in the north. That's why residents of southern states may values DST more. 
 Question:Which of the following is related to the deterrent effect of longer daylight? 
A. Fewer traffic accidents 
B. Fewer criminal activities 
C. More people shopping after work 
D. More people eating in restaurants

Context: A Concussion  happens when the brain is shaken, often in a car crash or a fall or a strike on; the head in sports.Concussions can be mild, but doctors may order a CT scan to look for a more serious injury.But a recent study warned that more children than necessary are being exposed  to radiation this way.
A national team led by two doctors at the University of California, Davis, studied hospital records from thousands of children with head injuries. They found that in many cases, the risk of developing cancer from the radiation outweighed the risk of a serious brain injury.
The study found that one in five children over age two had a low risk of serious injury but received CT scans anyway. The same was true of almost one in four children under two years of age.
The researchers have developed rules to predict if a head injury is serious enough for a scan. For children under two, doctors are advised against it if there is:
*Normal mental activity.
*No swelling in the back of the head.
*No feeling of a broken bone in the skull.  
*And no loss of consciousness for more than five seconds.
Doctors should also consider how the child was injured and whether the parents say the child is acting normally.
For patients from two to eighteen, the guidelines are similar ---- except there should be no l vomiting and no severe headache.
Earlier this year, the British Journal of Sports Medicine published new guidelines for concussions in children and teens. International experts said they should not return to sports or school until fully recovered. The brain also needs a ""cognitive rest,"" they say, by restricting activities like video games, texting and watching TV.
It often take longer than adults to recover from a concussion than adults. The experts say individual progress and not a set time period should always guide a decision to return to play.

 Question:How many aspects should doctors consider when deciding whether a child under two needs a CT scan? 
A. Four. 
B. Six. 
C. Seven. 
D. Nine. 
 Answer: B
Context: Most children have ever heard their parents yell ""sit up straight!"" or ""don't hang your head !"" when they eat dinner. Nowadays, it is also heard around another activity -- video games. Ten-year-old Owaish admits it takes him three to four hours a day to play games on his tablet computer. In addition, he plays for about two hours on the smart phone every day. As a result, he started suffering a serious pain in the neck around June or July. What's worse the pain has spread to the hand and back gradually, which makes his mother Mehzabin become concerned.
The doctors note the number of young children with the chronic pain  in their necks, arms and shoulders is on the increase sharp in recent years . They are not aging, they haven't had an accident, the blood reports are fine, their X-rays are fine, and their MRIs are fine. Facts have proved that the pain is from the poor posture  while they are playing video games on smart phones or other electronic devices. 19-year -old student Nida feels pain in the finger which holds the weight of her smart phone most of the day. Nida almost uses her smart phone 24/7, which means 24 hours a day, seven days a week, or all the time.
Health experts predict there will be not only physical but mental  problems resulting from the overuse of electronic devices. They encourage people to often take breaks and exercise from using computers, smart phones or other devices. Stand up! Stretch  the legs, back, shoulders and arms in all the possible directions. That's the most effective way and maybe the key to solving the problem completely. After all, the medication doesn't help sometimes.

Context: If you were asked what your body is made of, probably you would say that it is made of flesh  and bones and covered with skin. You also know something about the blood which flows through it, and that there is a very important part which we call the brain.
But the flesh and the bones make up the largest part of the body, and there is a good deal to be learned about them. You know the general appearance of both flesh and bone from the parts of animals which you see in the butcher's shop.
Bone is hard, and of a white color; indeed, it looks more like a piece of wood or stone than a part of a living animal. But bone is a real part of the living body, and it grows and is nourished  just as the body is. If a man breaks the bone of his arm or his leg, it is firmly bound up, to prevent the broken parts from moving out of the proper places, and in time then bone grows together again and becomes quite strong.
The bones are fastened together by various kinds of joints . They form the framework of the body, and give it strength to retain its proper shape. This framework is called the skeleton . Some animals, such as worms and slugs, have no skeleton; and others, such as shellfish, have a kind of hard covering or skeleton outside.
The most important part of the skeleton is the backbone. It is so important that naturalists divide all animals into two classes,--- those which have a backbone and those which have none. All the higher animals, including man, have a backbone, or vertebral column as it is called. They are therefore called vertebrate  animals. The others are called invertebrate animals. 
 Question:From the passage, we know higher animals are called  _  . 
A. backbone 
B. human beings 
C. vertebrate animals 
D. skeleton 
 Answer: C
Context: If a diver surfaces too quickly, he may suffer the bends. Nitrogen   dissolved   in his blood is suddenly liberated by the reduction of pressure. The consequence, if the bubbles   accumulate in a joint, is sharp pain and a bent body -- thus the name. If the bubbles form in his lungs or brain, the consequence can be death.
Other air-breathing animals also suffer this decompression   sickness if they surface too fast: whales, for example. And so, long ago, did ichthyosaurs  . That these ancient sea-animals got the bends can be seen from their bones. If bubbles of nitrogen form inside the bone they can cut off its blood supply. This kills the cells in the bone, and consequently weakens it, sometimes to the point of collapse. Fossil bones that have caved in on themselves are thus a sign that the animal once had the bends.
Bruce Rothschild of the University of Kansas knew all this when he began a suty of ichthyosaurs bones to find out how widespread the problem was in the past. What he particularly wanted to investigate was how ichthyosaurs adapted to the problem of decompession over the 150 milllion years. To this end, he and his colleagues traveled the world's natural-history museums, looking at hundreds of ichthyosaurs from the Trassic period and from the later Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
When he started, he assumed that signs of the bends would be rarer in younger fossils, reflecting their gradual evolution of measures to deal with decompression. Instead, he was astonished to discover the opposite. More than 15% of Jurassic and Cretaceous ichthyosaurs had suffered the bends before the died, but not a single Trassic specimen showed evidence of that sort of injury.
If ichthyosaurs did evolve an anti-decompression means, they clearly did so quickly -- and, most strangly, they lost it afterwards. But that is not what Dr Rothchild thinks happened. He suspects it was evolution in other animals that caused the change.
Whales that suffer the bends often do so because they have sufaced to escape a predator   such as a large shark. One of the features of the Jurassia oceans was an abundance of large sharks and crocodiles, both of which were fond of ichthyosaurs lunches. Trassic oceans, by contrast, were mercifully shark-and crocodile-free. In the Trassic, then, ichthyosaurs were top of the food chain. In the Jurrasic and Cretaceous, they were prey   as well as predator --and often had to make a speedy exit as a result. 
 Question:Rothchild's finding stated in Paragrapg 4  _  . 
A. confirmed his assumption 
B. speeded up his research process 
C. disagreed with his assumption 
D. changed his research objectives

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. "" 
 Question:Jennie gave her bone marrow to   _  . 
A. a close friend 
B. a stranger 
C. a classmate

Context: There are some strong-minded people that are able to stop smoking today and be free from the addiction the next day. However, some smokers may have to seek help from medication   in order to kick the habit.
     What medication actually does is to reduce the wish to smoke. Some of the medication must be taken with a doctor's guidance. The five most common medications to stop smoking are Bupropion SR, nicotine gum, nicotine inhalers, nicotine nasal spray and nicotine patches. People can buy nicotine gum and nicotine patches in chemists. However, the other medications require a prescription.
     Zyban tablets have been found to be highly effective in curing people of smoking addiction. The tablet needs to be taken whole, without crushing  it, as crushing can lead to side effects. It can be bought on the prescription of a doctor.
     Nicotine patches are filled with nicotine and they are applied to the skin. The skin takes in the nicotine and carries it to the blood stream. The amount of nicotine in these patches is quite limited, not enough to lead to addiction. But you shouldn't take them for dinner. In fact, millions of people have benefited from these nicotine patches.
     Nicotine gum is supposed to be a safer choice. It is used in such a way that it comes into contact with the blood vessels   in the mouth and then releases the nicotine. The nicotine should not go through the stomach; otherwise, it may cause certain side effects.
     These different types of medications have to be taken quite carefully. Do ask your doctor before taking any of these. 
 Question:Medication can   _  . 
A. weaken smokers' wish to smoke 
B. clear away the nicotine in smokers' bodies 
C. only be taken on the prescription of a doctor 
D. stop people from becoming addicted to smoking

Context: Nowadays with the development of agriculture, farmers use more technology. However, they are being told more needs to be done to stop them injuring at work. One in five British workplace deaths happens in agriculture even though farmers are only a small part of the working population. During the year 2012/13 there were 1,061 injuries in total and it is thought many more go unreported.
Jim Chapman from Warwickshire had his arm torn off by farm machinery seven years ago when he was 23. ""You don't realize how much you rely on your second arm until it's gone,"" he said. He fell against a PTO shaft  , a spinning metal bar at the back of a tractor. ""It catapulted   me from one side of the machine to the other,"" he said. ""I landed on the floor, minus all my clothing. My left arm had been torn off."" He admits that the machinery was missing part of its proper safety guard. ""But again,"" he added, ""it was a rushed day. There were a few machines that didn't work. Also, I was getting behind with the jobs.""
Over the last 10 years, other industries that you'd think of as dangerous, like building or quarrying  , have lowered the number of workplace deaths and injures. In the farming industry though, deaths remain high with 34 deaths in 2012/13. 
Judith Hackett, the chair of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) says it is ""not acceptable"" that the accident statistics for farming are still high. ""People in farming don't have minor   injuries. When they get injured, it's bad."" She said. ""When I said to the National Farmers' Union (NFU) that if I had sons I would not want them to work in agriculture, it really made them sit up and take notice."" There's a whole host of reasons why farming is as dangerous as it is. It is a very rough industry. Also, it's often because people are left alone. They could be young and inexperienced, or older people, who would have retired maybe 5 or 10 years ago in other industries.
Jim wants others to learn from his experience. ""Look at what you're doing before you go running in,"" he said. ""You could make a mistake that you'll live with for the rest of your life."" 
 Question:What happened to Jim Chapman when he was 23? 
A. He lost his job. 
B. He lost one of his arms. 
C. He lost both of his arms. 
D. His farm machine broke down. 
 Answer: B
Context: Not drying your hands thoroughly after washing them could increase the spread of bacteria, and rubbing your hands while using a traditional hand dryer could be a contributing factor, according to new research.
The research looked at different methods of hand drying, and their effects on transfer of bacteria from the hands to other surfaces. The different methods included paper towels, traditional hand dryer, and a new model of hand dryer, which rapidly blows water from the hands.
Our bodies naturally have bacteria all over them. However, bacteria from other sources, such as raw meat, can also survive on hands. They can be easily transferred to other surfaces, increasing the risk of cross-contamination . When the hands are washed, the number of the bacteria on the surface of the skin decreases, but they are not necessarily  _ . If the hands are still damp then these bacteria are more readily transferred to other surfaces.
The researchers quantified the effects of hand drying by measuring the number of bacteria on the hands before and after different drying methods. Volunteers were asked to wash their hands and palce them onto contact plates, which were then incubated   to measure bacteria growth.
The volunteers were then asked to dry their hands using either hand towels or one of the two hand dryers, with or without rubbing their hands together, and levels of bacteria were re-measured.
The researchers found that rubbing the hands together while using traditional hand dryers could cancel out the reduction in bacteria numbers following hand washing. When hands are rubbed together during drying, bacteria that live within the skin can be brought to the surface and transferred to other surfaces, along with surface bacteria that were not removed by hand washing.
A resaecher says, ""Good hand hygiene  should include drying your hands thoroughly and not just washing . The best method of drying your hands id using paper towels or using a hand dryer which doesn't require you to rub your hands together."" 
 Question:Which of the following results in the fewest bacteria after washing our hands? 
A. Dying our hands using wet towels. 
B. Dying our hands using paper towel. 
C. Rubbing your hands when drying. 
D. Air-drying our hands naturally.

Context: On the old-time farm in America, there were chickens, cows, pigs and horses. But there were very few machines. Most of the work was done by the farm family. Sometimes more workmen were needed in busy seasons. Work done by horses took up 79 percent; by men, 15 percent; and machine work only took up 6 percent.
Today all that has changed. On many modern farms machines now will do 96 percent of the work, while man does 3 percent. As for horses, they do 1 percent of the whole work. The children go to school by bus every morning; the parents work on the farm or in the house and other people's help is hardly needed. Their work has been replaced by a whole army of farm machines.

Context: Recently hand-foot-mouth disease has spread across China. In the past three months, there have been about 41,846 cases   in 30 provinces and regions. The number is increasing. Eighteen Chinese children have died of the disease so far this year.
What causes the disease and why is it dangerous?
Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common childhood illness. It mainly affects children under the age of 10. It gets its name from the rash   that develops on the hands and feet. It can also cause blisters   in your mouth.
A child who has the disease will usually have a fever, a runny nose and sore throat. He or she doesn't want to eat or drink because of pain in the mouth.
Hand-foot-mouth disease is mostly not serious. The fever and rash clear within a few days. But in some cases, the virus   affects the heart, lungs or brain. This puts the child's life in danger.
A virus causes hand-foot-mouth disease. The disease spreads easily where a lot of young children are together, such as in a child-care center. Sometimes it can also affect teenagers and adults.
In order not to pass on the virus, good hygiene   is important. We should wash our hands as often as possible. Especially we should wash our hands before meals and after going to the toilet. 
 Question:_   can help us to keep away from the hand-foot-mouth disease. 
A. Passing on the virus 
B. Taking children to the child-care center 
C. Keeping your hands clean 
D. Not going to public places

Context: It's impossible to determine how many people would have lost their lives without the contribution of African-American inventor Dr Charles Drew.
Charles Drew was born on June 3, 1904, in Washington, DC. His early interest was in education, but he was also an outstanding athlete. While in college, he was awarded as the man who contributed the most to sports during his four years in school. Drew's sister Elsie suffered from tuberculosis  and died in 1920. Her death influenced his decision to study medicine.
After becoming a doctor and working as a college instructor, Drew went to Columbia University, where he earned his Doctor of Medical Science degree. During this time he became involved in research on blood and blood transfusions.
At Columbia, he wrote a paper on ""banked blood"", in which he described a technique he developed for the long-term preservation of blood plasma. Before his discovery, blood could not be stored for more than two days because of the rapid breakdown of red blood cells. Drew had discovered that by separating the plasma from the whole blood and then refrigerating them separately, they could be combined a week later for a blood transfusion. Drew became the first African American to receive a PhD in medical science.
After World War II broke out, Drew was called upon to put his techniques into practice. He was named a project director for the American Red Cross but soon quit his post after the government issued an order that blood taken from white donors should be separated from that of black donors.
On April 1, 1950, after he attended the annual free clinic at the John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, he and other three physicians decided to drive back home. As he was tired from spending the night before in the operating room, he lost control of his car. Drew was badly injured and was taken to Alamance General Hospital in Burlington, North Carolina. He was pronounced dead half an hour after he first received medical attention. Drew's funeral was held on April 5, 1950, at the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church in Washington, DC.
But contrary to popular thought, he was not refused a blood transfusion by an all-white hospital. He indeed received a transfusion but was beyond the help of the doctors attending to him. As Dr. John Ford, one of the doctors who survived the accident, later explained, ""We all received the very best of care. The fact that he was a Black did not in any way limit the care that was given to him."" Over the years, Drew has been considered one of the most honored figures in the medical field. 
 Question:According to the passage,   _   might have contributed to the invention of blood banks. 
A. the combination of blood cells 
B. the rapid breakdown of red blood cells 
C. the development of refrigerating technique 
D. the technique of separating plasma from the whole blood

Context: Every year, World Blood Day is celebrated by blood services worldwide on 14 June, the birthday of Nobel Prize winner Karl Landsteiner, the man who discovered the ABO blood group system. If you have every thought of becoming a blood donor, just register to do it. And you should never worry about the donation.
Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body.
It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients.
First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday.
Although most people are able to give blood, some people who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease are no tasked to be donors. Pregnant women or those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood.
Blood has a very short shelf life. Some blood components can be kept longer than others, for instance red blood cells will keep for 35 days but platelets for only five. Remember, you should wait at least 16 weeks before donating blood again. 
 Question:What component of blood is used to treat burned patients? 
A. Plasma

Context: Michelle Obama has just started a campaign against childhood obesity   with the admission that she put her girls Malia and Sasha on a diet because they were getting fat. Clearly, childhood obesity must be solved urgently. But is it a good idea for mothers to put their daughters on diets?
Studies show that the more children diet, the more likely they are to become obese as adults. Research also shows that girls are highly influenced by their mothers when it comes to eating habits and body image.
This was the case for Carly, 40, who blames her mother for her lifelong struggle with weight. ""My mother was on a diet the whole time I was growing up,"" she says. ""And she put me on my first diet when I was 10. I lost puppy fat, gained her approval and never ate normally again.""
America's First Lady clearly has a vital healthy eating message to convey. But could this be damaging for Malia and Sasha? Could they develop eating disorders because of it?
""It's wrong just to blame mothers for their daughters' eating disorders,"" says Susan Ringwood, chief executive of the eating disorders charity. ""There is a genetic   component to eating disorders."" However, ""We do know that parents have a very strong influence over a child's eating. It's important to realize that you are your daughter's role model. Girls idolize their mothers."" says Ringwood.
""No food should ever be 'good 'or' bad',"" Ringwood says. Instead, ""You have to make it clear that food is a sociable, healthy and fun part of life, not something to be feared."" ""Talk to her about body image,"" Ringwood says. ""Talk about how curves are an important and exciting part of being a woman. Show her that anorexic  ) fashion models are not sexy, but ill. The pressure on girls today is immense,"" she says. Never forget that you are the authoritative  voice, too. 
 Question:It can be concluded that   _  . 
A. eating disorder always goes hand in hand with being slim 
B. girls are more concerned about body shapes than boys 
C. daughters tend to have a lifelong struggle with weight 
D. the author is against children's dieting 
 Answer: D
Context: You'd be forgiven for thinking that running after children each day would leave parents in the best shape of their lives.But a study has found that the mothers and fathers of young children are more unhealthy than their childless peers .
Mothers with young children are heavier and eat more calories and fatty foods,and consume more sugary dinks than chidless women,scientists said.And both sexes are less active than those in their age group without children.
Parents often choose quick,easily preparesd foods that are high in fat and calories,and by choosing these foods they may in turn serve them to their children,forming a cycle of unhealthy diet.
Dr.Berge,one of the study authors,said:""This isn't a study about blame,this is about spotting a very high-risk time period for parents that doctors should be aware of ,so they can offer solutions .""
According to the study ,mothers ate more fatty foods and drank about seven sugary drinks weekly,equal to about four chidless women.They also had an average of 2,360 calories daily,368 calories more than women without children,With that many calorise,women that age would need to be active to avoid to avoid gaining weight.
Fathers ate about the same amount of daily calories childless men and both had an average boby-mass index ,but fathersgot less physical activity--about five hours weekly ,compared to almost seven hours among chidless men.
The study has several limitations-there's no data on how many women reccently had babies.Ther's also no information on the number of single parents,who likely face diet and exercise challenges.Sarah Kriger,an American dietician who works with new mothers said some of the mothers may have had postpartum depression,which might affect their eating and exercise habits. 
 Question:Which of the following is NOT mentioned about mothers with children? 
A. They are less active 
B. They eat unhealthy foods 
C. They may feel unhappy aftre having babies 
D. They may lose their jobs aftre having babies 
 Answer: D
Context: Scientists have discovered a special biological behavior in dolphins  that could lead to a treatment for late-onset diabetes  in humans. Studies on dolphins found that healthy dolphins switch into a diabetic-like state overnight when they are not feeding, but return to normal when they eat the following morning.
The extraordinary finding has led scientists to suggest that dolphins have ""genetic switch"" that allows them to imitate diabetes while they are not feeding for a night, without suffering any ill effect.
If researchers can identify a similar genetic pathway in human, they may be able to develop drugs to effectively switch off diabetes. Some 2.2 million people in Britain have type 2 (or late-onset) diabetes, a figure that is expected to reach 4 million by 2025 as a consequence of rising levels of obesity .
The tissues of people with type 2 diabetes have become resistant to insulin  so they lose the ability to control sugar levels in their blood. The condition can damage the heart, eyes, kidneys  and nerves and contribute to 5% of all deaths, according to the World Healthy Organization.
Dolphins appear to imitate diabetes to keep high levels of blood sugar when food is rare. Like humans, dolphins need some sugar in their blood for their brains to function normally. Venn-Watson's team analyzed 1,000 blood samples  from 52 dolphins while they didn't eat anything overnight and fed in the morning. At night time, the dolphins' metabolism changed greatly and showed similar characteristics to that seen in people with type 2 diabetes.
""It is our hope that this discovery can lead to new ways to prevent, treat and maybe even cure diabetes in humans,"" said Stephanie Venn-Watson, director of clinical research at the National Marine Foundation in San Diego. 
 Question:What's the main idea of the passage? 
A. Humans get some idea of treating diabetes from dolphins. 
B. Dolphins can switch into a diabetic-like state overnight. 
C. Humans can suffer the same disease as dolphins. 
D. Dolphins should be fed regularly to avoid diabetes.

Context: If babies are given more love and feelings by their mothers, they will deal better with stress and anxiety when they grow up , research has shown.
The study of eight-month-old children shows even the very earliest life experiences can influence our happiness.
Lots of mother love makes children form a safe bond with their mothers , so they are able to feel safe in relationships when they grow up ,and they will have better social skills and deal with life's difficulties.
The researchers,  led by Dr.Joanna Maselko of Duke University in North Carolina,  studied the relationships of 482 eight--month - old  babies with their mothers during daily development.
They studied how well the mother had dealt with her child's developmental text and how she had responded child's performance.Mental health was then assessed when the babies had grown up - at the average of 34.
The more feelings and attention a mother gave to her child, the better her child would be. This kind of child had the lowest levels of anxiety, hostility and general difficulties. 
 Question:Which of the following is right according to text? 
A. Mental health was then assessed when all the babies were 34. 
B. The very earliest life experiences can influence our lives. 
C. All the mothers love makes children feel safe in relationship when they grow up. 
D. Lots of mother love makes children form safe bond with their mothers .

Context: A Concussion  happens when the brain is shaken, often in a car crash or a fall or a strike on; the head in sports.Concussions can be mild, but doctors may order a CT scan to look for a more serious injury.But a recent study warned that more children than necessary are being exposed  to radiation this way.
A national team led by two doctors at the University of California, Davis, studied hospital records from thousands of children with head injuries. They found that in many cases, the risk of developing cancer from the radiation outweighed the risk of a serious brain injury.
The study found that one in five children over age two had a low risk of serious injury but received CT scans anyway. The same was true of almost one in four children under two years of age.
The researchers have developed rules to predict if a head injury is serious enough for a scan. For children under two, doctors are advised against it if there is:
*Normal mental activity.
*No swelling in the back of the head.
*No feeling of a broken bone in the skull.  
*And no loss of consciousness for more than five seconds.
Doctors should also consider how the child was injured and whether the parents say the child is acting normally.
For patients from two to eighteen, the guidelines are similar ---- except there should be no l vomiting and no severe headache.
Earlier this year, the British Journal of Sports Medicine published new guidelines for concussions in children and teens. International experts said they should not return to sports or school until fully recovered. The brain also needs a ""cognitive rest,"" they say, by restricting activities like video games, texting and watching TV.
It often take longer than adults to recover from a concussion than adults. The experts say individual progress and not a set time period should always guide a decision to return to play.

Context: Perhaps it is hard to imagine that a bad tooth could be deadly. But doctors in the Washington area say a twelveyearold boy died last month of a tooth infection that spread to his brain. They say it might have been prevented if the boy had received the dental care he needed.
Experts at the National Institutes of Health say good dental care should start at birth. They say breast milk is the best food for the healthy development of teeth. Breast milk can help slow bacterial growth and acid production in the mouth.
When baby's teeth begin to appear,you can clean them with a wet toothbrush. Dentists say it is important to find soft toothbrushes made especially for babies,and use them very gently.
The use of fluoride   to protect teeth is common in many parts of the world. This natural element is often added to drinking water supplies. The fluoride mixes with enamel ,the hard surface on teeth,to help prevent holes,or cavities from forming.
But the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry points out that young children often swallow toothpaste when they brush their teeth. The group notes that swallowing fluoridated toothpaste can cause problems. So young children should be carefully supervised when they brush their teeth. And only a small amount of fluoridated toothpaste,the size of a green pea,should be used.
Parents often wonder what effects sucking a thumb or sucking on a pacifier might have on their baby's teeth. Dental experts generally agree that this is fine early in life.
The American Academy of Family Physicians says most kids stop sucking their thumbs by the age of four. If it continues,the group advises parents to talk to their child's dentist or doctor. It could influence the correct development of permanent teeth. 
 Question:The boy with a bad tooth died because  _  . 
A. his tooth disease was very deadly 
B. the doctor refused to treat him properly 
C. he didn't receive timely treatment 
D. something was wrong with his brain 
 Answer: C
Context: Hospital emergency rooms treat injured fingers all the time. Without treatment, a bad cut can lead to permanent damage. But how should a person know when a bleeding cut is serious enough to require medical attention? We asked Dr Martin Brown, chairman of the department of emergency medicine at Inova Alexandria Hospital in Virginia.
First, the medical term for a cut or tear in the skin is a laceration(,). Dr Brown says the length is usually not as important as the depth. He says a long cut on a finger can likely be treated without a visit to a doctor if the wound is not very deep. ""If you have a short but deep laceration where there's been a structure underneath that's been damaged - a tendon, a nerve, a blood vessel,"" says Martin, ""it may, in fact, need professional attention.""
Some injuries - like a fingertip that gets cut off - might even require surgery to repair. That requires a specialist to either file  down the bone or _ the fingertip. More often, filing down the bone is what is done because reattaching a fingertip is often not successful.
How a wound bleeds can be a sign of how serious it is. Minor cuts usually produce what is known as venous   bleeding. This means the blood flows steadily from the injury. The bleeding will often stop when pressure is put on the wound. Dr Brown says in most cases holding direct pressure with clean gauze or a cloth for four to five minutes should stop the bleeding. With a cut finger, holding the hand above the heart can reduce the loss of blood. But if a cut appears to be pumping blood out with some force, this may be a sign of arterial  bleeding. This kind of injury should be treated by a medical professional as soon as possible.
Even a cut that does not require medical attention must be kept clean to prevent infection. Small cuts should be cleaned gently with clean water. Use a washcloth to clean the area if the wound is dirty. Dr Brown says cuts should be covered with a clean, dry bandage. 
 Question:.The best title of this passage should be  _  . 
A. Hospital Emergency Treatments For Injured Fingers 
B. When a Cut Finger Is More Serious Than It Might Seem 
C. Serious Finger Cut That Requires Medical Attention 
D. Keep Finger Cuts Clean to Prevent Serious Infection

Context: More than four decades ago British scientist Robert Edwards first witnessed the miracle of human life growing inside a test tube at his Cambridge lab. Since that ground-breaking moment, more than four million babies have been born through IVF and in 2010 his great contribution to science was finally recognized as he was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine.
The prize for Dr Edwards, who was given a Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Award in 2008, includes a PS900,000 cheque. The Nobel Assembly described IVF as a ""milestone in modern medicine"".
With the help of fellow scientist Patrick Steptoe, the Manchester-born physiologist developed IVF -- leading to the birth of the world's first test tube baby. Dr Steptoe died 10 years later but their work has transformed fertility treatment and given hope to millions of couples.
It was a scientific breakthrough that transformed the lives of millions of couples. They said: ""His achievements have made it possible to treat infertility, a disease which makes human unable to have a baby. This condition has been afflicting a large percentage of mankind including more than 10% of all couples worldwide.""
Louise Brown, the world's first test tube baby, made international headlines when she was born in Oldham, Gtr Manchester, in 1978 to parents Lesley and John who had been fruitlessly trying for a baby since 1969.
Ivf-in-vitro fertilisation is the process whereby egg cells are fertilised outside the body before being implanted in the womb. After a cycle of IVF, the probability of a couple with infertility problems having a baby is one in five -- the same as healthy couples who conceive naturally.
Professor Edwards, who has five daughters and 11 grandchildren, began his research at Cambridge University in 1963, after receiving his PhD in 1955.He once said: ""The most important thing in life is having a child. Nothing is more special than a child."" With the help of fellow scientist Patrick Steptoe, Prof. Edwards founded the Bourn Hall clinic in Cambridge shire, which now treats more than 900 women a year. Each year, more than 30,000 women in Britain now undergo IVF and 11,000 babies are born as a result of the treatment.
But his work attracted widespread criticism from some scientists and the Catholic Church who said it was ""unethical and immoral"".
Martin Johnson, professor of reproductive  sciences at the University of Cambridge, said the award was ""long overdue"". He said: ""We couldn't understand why the Nobel has come so late but he is delighted -- this is the cherry on the cake for him.""
Professor Edwards was too ill to give interviews but a statement released by his family said he was ""thrilled and delighted"". 
 Question:Why did Professor Edwards begin his research on tube baby? 
A. Because he thought it of great significance to have a child in life. 
B. Because the birthrate around the world was unexpectedly low then. 
C. Because a special child did make a difference to an ordinary family. 
D. Because his fellow scientist wanted to give hope to the unlucky couples. 
 Answer: A
Context: My mother fought cancer for almost a decade and died at 56. She held out long enough to meet the first of her grandchildren and to hold him in her arms. But my other children will never have the chance to know her and experience how loving and gracious she was.
We often speak of ""Mommy's mommy,"" and I find myself trying to explain the illness that took her away from us. They have asked if the same could happen to me. I have always told them not to worry, but the truth is that I carry a ""faulty"" gene, BRCA1, which sharply increases my risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian  cancer.
My doctors estimated that I had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman.
Once I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much as I could. I started with the breasts, as my risk of breast cancer is higher than my risk of ovarian cancer, and the surgery is more complex.
On April 27, I finished the three months of medical procedures. During that time I have been able to keep this private and to carry on with my work. But I am writing about it now because I hope that other women can benefit from my experience. Cancer is still a word that strikes fear into people's hearts, producing a deep sense of powerlessness. But today it is possible to find the way out through a blood test whether you are highly susceptible to breast and ovarian cancer, and then take action.
My own process began on February 2. The operation took eight hours. Then I woke up with tubes in my breasts. It did feel like a scene out of a science-fiction film. But days after surgery I can be back to a normal life. There have been many advances in this procedure in the last few years, and the results can be beautiful.
I wanted to write this to tell other women that the decision to have a surgery operation was not easy. But it is one I am very happy that I made. My chances of developing breast cancer have dropped from 87 percent to under 5 percent. I can tell my children that they don't need to fear they will lose me.
It is a comfort that they see nothing that makes them scared. They can see my small scars and that's it. Everything else is just Mommy, the same as she always was. And they know that I love them and I will do anything to be with them as long as I can. On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. 
For any woman reading this, I hope it helps you to know you have options. I want to encourage every woman, especially if you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, to seek out the information and medical experts who can help you through this aspect of your life, and to make your own informed choices.
I acknowledge that there are many wonderful holistic doctors working on alternatives to surgery. My own regimen  will be posted in due course on the Web site of the Pink Lotus Breast Center. I hope that this will be helpful to other women.
I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they can take measures.
Life comes with many challenges. The ones that should not scare us are the ones we can take on and take control of.

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. ""

A. a close friend 
B. a stranger 
C. a classmate 
D. a

Context: Along with the Great Pyramid of Giza. The Sphinx  is one of the most studied ancient monument of mankind's history. The whole complex of Giza, composed of the Sphinx, the Great Pyramid, other pyramids, and distinct structures, definitely holds the key to understanding advanced past civilizations. In the examination of the mystery of the great Sphinx we run into a similar situation. The Egyptians wrote very little about the construction of the Sphinx. However, the Egyptians, Romans, and Arabs did write accounts concerning its numerous restorations, which will be discussed later in this article. In addition, it should be said that other cultures had their form of a Sphinx. For example, the Greek Sphinx was a female with a human head, breast, and the body of a feminine lion.
Now there are basically two schools of thought on the origin, the age and the builder of the Sphinx in Egypt. The traditional view of Egyptologists is that Pharaoh Khafre of the Fourth Dynasty built the Sphinx along with the Great Pyramid around 2,500 BC. The evidence is that the face of the Sphinx is thought to look like Pharaoh Khafre. This theory makes the Sphinx about 5,000 years old according to Dr Zahi Hawass, director of Giza Saqqara of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization.
The other school of thought doesn't believe that the Egyptians built the Sphinx, but thinks that it was built by an advanced civilization before the Egyptians. The Egyptians came later and built their tombs and temples along the sides of these great structures.  
This school of thought has been around for hundreds of years, but new buildings give it more  _ . Recently, Graham Hancock , the author of the famous book Finger-prints of the Gods and some American scholars have presented certain evidence that challenges the traditional thought on the Sphinx.
They present proofs that may cause a rethinking of the so-called fact used to determine who built the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid of Giza and for what purpose. Their proofs consist of basically two pieces of evidence astronomical  calculations of the stars and geological evidence that the erosion  of the Sphinx and other monuments of Giza was due to water rather than sand, wind or sunshine according to Robert Bauval's book  _ . It is this evidence that  has turned the Egyptologists' world upside down. 
 Question:Which of the following is the main purpose of the passage? 
A. To show the importance of the Sphinx. 
B. To tell us two views on the origin of the Sphinx. 
C. To introduce an advanced civilization to us. 
D. To explain some mysteries of the Sphinx.

Context: One Sunday, my family had gathered at my parents' house to feast upon Mom's wonderful cooking. During the normal dinner chatter  , I noticed that my father was slurring   his words. No one mentioned this during dinner, but I felt compelled to discuss it with my mother afterward.
We decided that there was something seriously wrong and that Dad needed to see the doctor.
Mom phoned me two days later. ""The doctor found a brain tumor  . It's too large at this point to operate. Maybe they can do something then, but _ .""
Even with the treatment, my father's condition worsened, and the doctor finally informed us that this condition was terminal  . During one of his stays in the hospital, we brought our baby daughter Chelsey with us when we visited him. By this time he had great difficulty speaking. I finally figured out that he wanted Chelsey to sit on his stomach so he could make faces at her.
Watching the two of them together, I realized I was living an experience that would stay with me forever. Though grateful for the times they could share, I couldn't shake the feeling of a clock ticking in the background.
On the visit to my parents' home during what we all know was my father's last days, my mother took Chelsey from my arms and announced, ""Your father would like to see you alone for a minute.""
I entered the bedroom where my father lay on a rented hospital bed. He appeared even weaker than the day before.
""How are you feeling, Dad?"" I asked. ""Can I do anything for you?""
He tried to speak, but he couldn't make out a word.
""I'm sorry, but I can't understand you,"" I said.
With great difficulty he said, ""I love you.""
We don't learn courage from heroes on the evening news. We learn true courage from watching ordinary people rise above hopeless situations. In many ways my father was a strict, uncommunicative man. He found it difficult to show emotion. The bravest thing I ever saw him do was overcome that barrier to open his heart to his son and family at the end of his life.

Context: Many people have never heard of Mesothelioma and are unaware of its symptoms. Although considered a rare form of cancer, each year the number of cases grows. With the prevalence of this disease on the rise, it is critical to understand why and how Mesothelioma develops and what courses of action can be taken in the event of diagnosis. The following is a list of frequently asked questions and answers that will provide you with some information on Mesothelioma, and the legal issues surrounding it.
What is Mesothelioma?
Mesothelioma is the term used to describe a cancerous tumor found in the mesothelial cells of an organ. The organs where this form of cancer is most commonly found are the lungs, heart and abdominal organs. Pleural Mesothelioma is cancer of the lung lining(,)and is the most common form of Mesothelioma.
What causes Mesothelioma?
Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos . Asbestos is often found in building materials used before the mid 1970's. In addition, materials such as pipes, boiler insulation, floor, ceiling and roof tiles may contain asbestos.
How much asbestos exposure will cause Mesothelioma?
Generally, the probability of developing this form of cancer is in accordance with the length of time you are exposed to asbestos. Also, your health is at risk if your exposure to asbestos is intense. It should be noted that Mesothelioma has a latency period of 20 to 50 years. This means that you may develop the disease long after your exposure to asbestos. On average, people tend to develop Mesothelioma somewhere between 35 and 40 years after exposure.
How quickly does Mesothelioma progress?
The onset of Mesothelioma is quite slow. Patients will begin to experience symptoms such as lower back pain and chest pain. These symptoms may also be accompanied by weight loss, fever and difficulty breathing. Unfortunately, once Mesothelioma develops, it quickly becomes aggressive and treatment must be sought immediately.
Can Mesothelioma be treated?
Doctors are able to use several traditional methods of cancer treatment for Mesothelioma, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Like all forms of cancer, detecting the disease at the earliest stage possible greatly increases the patient's chances for survival. If you have worked in an industry such as construction or suspect that you may have been exposed to asbestos, be alert for symptoms and contact your doctor immediately.
What legal courses of action can be taken?
Anyone suffering from Mesothelioma is entitled to compensation from asbestos manufacturers. Additionally, if you are the spouse or child of someone who has died from Mesothelioma, you are entitled to file a claim and seek compensation. 
 Question:Which of the following would be the best title for the text? 
A. Terrible Mesothelioma 
B. Mesothelioma is around us 
C. Frequently Asked Questions About Mesothelioma 
D. Mesothelioma in on the rise

Context: When most of us look at our hands, we might notice that we need to clean, or stop biting our fingernails, and that's about it. But if you ask a doctor, he can see a whole lot more. Everything from poor diet and stress to serious kidney   problems can be revealed by a glance at your fingernails.
There are about 30 different nail signs that can be associated with medical issues, though may indicate more than one problem, according to Dr.Amy Derick, a clinical instructor of dermatology at Northwestern University.
Here are five of the things a doctor can tell about your health based on your fingernails.
1. People who aren't eating well and lack vitamin or dietary may have thinner than normal nails, which are more likely to break.
2.Horizontal   lines are associated with serious physical stress. They frequently occur in people who have gone through chemotherapy .They can also occur after some illnesses, injuries, or with severe malnourishment .Interestingly, there may be an altitude connection too. They've also been found in people who dove 1,000 feet and others who participated in an Everest exploration.
3. Vertical  lines, however, are generally not such a big deal. Some people are more genetically prone to them than others, but they're commonly associated with aging.
4. When people lack iron, their nails can turn spoon-like. Instead of curving down and covering the finger normally, they 'll start to rise up on the sides and front, like the part of a spoon that holds liquid.
5. Kidney and liver problems can create ""half-and-half nails"", where one part of the nail is white and the other part dark or pink, according to Derick.
Doctors note that because disease diagnosis is complex and some symptoms can be associated with different diseases, you should always see a medical professional if you are concerned about something you notice. 
 Question:Who will have horizontal lines on the nails ? 
A. A cancer patient who has received normal treatment. 
B. Hungry African children suffering from severe malnourishment. 
C. An explorer who had reached Zhangjiajie in Hunan Province. 
D. A patient with serious illness, like kidney and liver problems. 
 Answer: B
Context: Do you know you could get sick just by walking past a building? The bacteria  that cause Legionnaire's disease grow very fast in large modern buildings. They are carried by air through the buildings and outside. Legionnaire s disease is only one of the illnesses that are caused by ""sick buildings"".
Some buildings can make you ill because their heating and air-conditioning  are controlled . Air from outside cannot get in through the closed windows; This indoor air pollution is a growing problem.
Legionnaire's disease may be the most serious result of sick buildings, but other unpleasant illnesses can appear.People who work in some buildings suffer  from tiredness, feeling sick and headaches. Their offices look bright and clean, but invisible  and dangerous bacteria are in the air around them.
There is an answer to the problem. The air-conditioning and heating can be tested for bacteria. _ This is expensive to do, but the results are good. The people in the buildings no longer get sick, and everybody is happier. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE? 
A. Legionnaire's disease is only one of the results of ""sick buildings"". 
B. There is less and less indoor air pollution. 
C. The bacteria are not dangerous if the offices look bright and clean. 
D. If the tests for bacteria are expensive. the results are good. .

Context: Ever feel like you've been hit on the head after a bad night's sleep? According to scientists, the thought isn't as unbelievable as it seems.
A study found going without sleep for just one night causes changes in the brain similar to those that occur after a blow to the head. The researchers said the healthy young men examined in the study showed a sudden increase in the same chemicals which indicate brain damage. Professor Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, Sweden, explained that the chemicals NSE and S-100B are biomarkers for brain damage, such as concussion . He said, ""What we found was their levels in the blood rose in the group that went without sleep for a night. This was not to the extent that would happen after a head injury, for instance, but it was still significant. During sleep, the brain cleans poisonous substances off itself.""
Benedict also said previous studies which linked a lack of sleep with increased risk of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis could applaud his study. The rise of the chemicals in the blood after sleep loss may suggest not getting enough sleep contributes to a loss of brain tissue, he explained. Benedict, whose study is published in the journalSleep, added, ""In conclusion, the findings of our experiment indicate a good night's sleep may be critical to maintaining brain health.""
A third of the UK population suffer from sleep-related problems, while the average person now sleeps for only seven hours a night, compared with almost nine a few decades ago. Many scientists believe irregular sleeping patterns lead to illnesses ranging from aches and pains to heart disease, while less than eight hours' sleep a night can lower the IQ the next day. 
 Question:What do we know about previous studies? 
A. They found reasons for brain disorders. 
B. Their findings were published inSleep. 
C. They were supported by Benedict's study. 
D. They focused on brain health. 
 Answer: C
Context: There are various reasons why cancers appear to be on the increase. For one thing, though their sufferers are to be found in all age groups, cancers are particularly likely to attack persons in their middle and advanced years. Naturally, since people live longer these years, there are more cancer sufferers than before. Again, with better methods of diagnosis  , doctors can more easily recognize cancerous growths that would formerly have passed unnoticed or that would have been wrongly diagnosed. It is also believed that certain habits and conditions of modern living, including heavy smoking and the pollution of the air, may leave people living in more cancer-causing conditions than before.
We all look forward to the day when a simple medical test can find cancer while it is still small. Researchers around the world are working on _ . Most of their work deals with the examination of the blood.
Researchers in Boston have found something in the blood of cancer patients that does not appear in healthy persons. The test showed which persons had cancer and which did not. It was correct more than 90 percent of the time.
The researchers believe the test may be able to show cancer very clearly in its development. Cancers discovered early usually can be treated successfully.
The test examines very small bits of fat in the blood called lipids  . Cancers seem to change lipids although doctors do not know why. The test showed differences between the lipids of the persons with cancer and the lipids of those without cancer.
The researchers say the new test could be a step to develop a simple way to check patients for cancer before the disease shows on an X-ray.

B. Cancers can be cured

Context: Close relationships, thought to help communication by giving speakers a common context, are actually more likely to make  _ when strangers are involved, a new study suggests.
Because close colleagues and friends already share so much common knowledge that they often use short, ambiguous  messages which can lead to misunderstandings.
""People are so used to talking with those with whom they already share a great deal of information that, when they have something really new to share, they often present it in a way that they assume the person already knows it."" says study-team member Boaz Keysar.
Keysar and his graduate student, Shall Wu, trained 40 pairs of undergraduate students to memorize made-up names and descriptions of strange shapes. In each pair, the ""director"" had to communicate the identity of one of the 24 shapes. The partner had to use the information to choose the correct shape from a set of three images on a computer monitor.
Half of the partners studied only the first six shapes, while the others learned the first 18 shapes. The directors, who had memorized all the shapes, were aware of their partners' knowledge levels of the shapes.
In the pairs with the most shared knowledge, the directors were more likely to rattle off  shape names, compared with pairs with little knowledge overlap , in which the directors were more likely to describe the actual shapes. Not surprisingly, participants with more shared knowledge were twice as likely to ask for clarification as those with less overlap.
Language itself can be confusing. ""The reason all this is happening at all is that language in general is ambiguous,"" said Keysar.
He recalls an ambiguous billboard near a stadium holding a Rolling Stones concert that night. The billboard read, ""Avoid LSD tonight."" (:LSD"""")
Hmmm? ""It was about Lake Shore Drive, and I'm sure the writer of the sign didn't realize he was being ambiguous,"" Keysar said.
""Even though miscommunication can lead to missed meetings or deadlines, people are often unaware when their language is ambiguous,"" Keysar added, ""We don't realize we say things that are ambiguous,"" he said, ""and that's a problem."" 
 Question:In Keysar's experiment, which of the following gives more accurate descriptions of the shapes? 
A. The ""directors"" of the pairs with little shared knowledge. 
B. The ""directors"" of the pairs who shared more knowledge. 
C. The partners whose directors rattle off shape names. 
D. The partners whose directors give clear clarifications.

We fail to have calls screened by a skillful secretary or assistant, or we leave our door open, actually assuring constant interruptions.
In almost all cases, it is possible to influence, if not control, it usually can cause problems, such as, slowness and indecision, lack of self-discipline, the inability to delegate, or the tendency to fight fires, to act without thinking, and to jump from task to task without finishing any of them.
Time is constant that cannot be changed. The clock cannot be slowed down or speeded up. Thus we cannot manage time itself. We can only manage our activities with respect to time.
The same skills are needed as those used in managing others--the abilities to plan, organize, delegate, direct, and control. Time management is simply self-management. It is impossible to be effective in any position without controlling one's time effectively.
Successful time management does not mean working harder, but working smarter. All kinds of management skills must be used in the home and office to get most value from time. You must think ahead about what to do, and timely than others, making it get maximum results in the shortest possible period. 
 Question:It can be concluded from the passage that the abilities to plan, organize, delegate, direct and control should_. 
A. be used in managing others' activities 
B. be used in managing one's own activities 
C. not be used in time management 
D. be used in managing both others' and one's activities

Context: The most common use of intelligence test scores is to predict degree of academic success. Such scores are used in some communities as bases for admitting able children to schools at ages younger than normal, and they are very generally used to determine admissions to schools beyond public secondary school. Another use common in elementary schools involves comparing such scores with performances in various subjects to identify children who are working below capacity.
The greatest problem in using intelligence tests for the purpose of prediction is that no dependable criterion of their accuracy exists. The ideal criteria would be objective and reliable achievement tests following instruction in each subject, but there are few such tests, especially at the college level. Studies have shown that correlations  between intelligence tests and achievement tests in various subjects through secondary school range roughly from 0.5 to 0.8. Such correlations are fairly high, but they do not suggest anywhere near complete agreement.
At the college level there are two major tests used as criteria of admission. By far the more important is the College Entrance Examination, constructed by the Educational Testing Service authorized by the College Entrance Examination Board. These tests are returned to the Educational Testing Service for scoring, and the results are then made available to the various colleges authorized by the students to receive them. The second test of this type is the American College Test, which operates in essentially the same fashion.
Both tests constitute measures of certain skills, abilities, and knowledge that have been found to be related to success in college. Their correlations with academic success are limited for three outstanding reasons. First, measures of achievement in college are themselves perhaps no more reliable than those in elementary and secondary schools. Second, intellectual factors do not alone determine academic success, especially at the college level. Many students drop out of schools because they are inadequately motivated or because they dislike the instructional programme. Third, correlations are lowered because the use of such tests for denying admission to some students means that the range of scores for those admitted is restricted, and such restriction tend to reduce correlation. 
 Question:The correlations between two college admission tests and academic success in college are limited for the reason that   _  . 
A. many students drop out of schools 
B. students are not adequately motivated 
C. intellectual factors are more important for students than when they were in primary and middle schools 
D. measures of college achievement are unreliable like those in primary and middle schools.

Context: Cell phone use and texting are increasingly common, especially among teens. And that could be a problem. Texting affects learning and performing on test, a new study finds. So a Montana teen, Colin decided to test that.
They asked 47 classmates to take part in a two-part experiment. The goal was to test how well these students understood written material. Each one had to read a paragraph or two about a certain topic, then answer questions about it.
In the first part, the participants had 15 minutes to understand and then answer questions about six readings. Throughout this test, they met no distractions.
During a new set of readings, the brothers sent messages to the participants' cell phones every 90 seconds. In each message, there were questions that required a reply.
Participants should have scored better on the second test because it was easier. In fact, they scored worse when distracted by messages. Only a few students scored as well when replying to messages as they did when undistracted. But importantly, nobody performed better during the texting part.
The brothers presented details of their findings at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. Boys and girls scored equally poorly while texting, the brothers noticed. Older participants didn't do any better than younger ones. And it didn't matter if a student thought he was good at multitasking. On average, the brothers found that even students who were confident of their abilities did just as poorly while texting. Surprisingly, even though the students remembered less of what they read while texting, most of them answered questions in messages perfectly.
""Our teachers are very happy to see these results,"" says Coler. The teens' new data strongly support their teachers' opinion that texting while studying is a serious distraction. 
 Question:What's Colter's teachers' attitude toward the results? 
A. Surprised. 
B. Worried. 
C. Satisfied. 
D. Serious. 
 Answer: C
Context: A long-term American study shows the importance of early education for poor children. The study is known as the Abecedarian Project. It involved  more than one-hundred young children from poor families in North Carolina.
Half of the children attended an all-day program at a high-quality childcare center. The center offered educational, health and social programs. Children took part in games and activities to increase their thinking and language skills and social and emotional development. The program also included health foods for the children
The children attended the program from when they were a few weeks old until the age of five years. The other group of children did not attend the childcare center. After the age of five, both groups attended public school.
Researchers compared the two groups of children. When they were babies, both groups had similar results in tests for mental and physical skills. However, from the age of eighteen months, the children in the educational child care program did much better in tests. 
The researchers tested the children again when they were twelve and fifteen years old. The tests found that the children who had been in the childcare center continued to have higher average test results. These children did much better on tests of reading and mathematics. 
A few years ago, organizers of the Abecedarian Project tested the students again. At the time, each student was twenty-one years old. They were tested for thinking and educational ability, employment, parenting and social skills. The researchers found that the young adults who had the early education still did better in reading and mathematics tests. They were more than two times as likely to be attending college or to have completed college. In addition, the children who received early education were older on average, when their first child was born. 
The study offers more evidence that learning during the first months and years of life is important for all later development. 
The researchers of the Abecedarian Project believe their study shows a need for lawmakers to spend money on public early education. They believe these kinds of programs could reduce the number of children who do not complete school and are unemployed. 
 Question:The Abecedarian Project has lasted  _  . 
A. almost one year 
B. about five years 
C. no more than 15 years 
D. more than 20 years 
 Answer: D
Context: Students who date   in middle school have significantly worse study skills, are four times more likely to drop out of school and report twice as much alcohol and tobacco use than their single classmates, according to new research from the University of Georgia.
""Romantic relationships are a symbol of adolescence , but very few studies have examined how adolescents are different in the development of these relationships."" said Pamela Orpinas, study author and professor in the College of Public Health.
Orpinas followed a group of 624 students over a seven-year period from 6th to 12th grade. Each year, the group of students completed a survey indicating whether they had dated and reported the frequency of different behaviors, including the use of drugs and alcohol. Their teachers completed questionnaires   about the students' academic efforts. He found some students never or hardly ever reported dating from middle to high school, and these students had the best study skills according to their teachers. Other students dated infrequently in middle school but increased the frequency of dating in high school.
""At all points in time, teachers rated the students who reported the lowest frequency of dating as having the best study skills and the students with the highest dating as having the worst study skills,"" according to the journal article. Study skills refer to behaviors that lead to academic success such as doing work for extra credit, being well organized, finishing homework, working hard and reading assigned chapters.
""Dating a classmate may have the same emotional complications of dating a co-worker,"" Orpinas said, ""When the couple break up, they have to continue to see each other in class and perhaps witness the ex-partner dating someone else. It is reasonable to think this could be linked to depression and divert   attention from studying.""
""Dating should not be considered a ceremony of growth in middle school.""Orpinas concluded. 
 Question:What can possibly happen to the school couples after they break up? 
A. They will miss their ex-partners sometimes. 
B. They don't want to see each other any longer. 
C. Their attention to studying will be affected. 
D. They will think it's reasonable to get depressed.

Context: French doctors and American scientists have reported doing an operation in which the doctor was outside the operating room. This kind of operation is known as robotic operation.
Doctor Marescaux did the operation in an office in New York City last month, while a sixty-eight-year-old woman patient was in a hospital in Strasbourg, France.
A doctor in Strasbourg got the patient ready. He placed medical tools and a small video camera in her stomach area. Doctor Marescaux in New York watched the patient on a video screen. Then he used the computer to send messages to the robot machine. The robot moved the tools that cut the woman's gallbladder away. The woman got well soon after the operation and left the hospital two days later.
Experts say the main problem with such a robotic operation is based on high-speed telecommunications between the doctor and the robot. Technology must be able to send a doctor's order to a robot to move the tools quickly.
Experts also say a successful robotic operation will improve an operation. For example, the robot can make much smaller movements than a person can. A robot machine can turn tools in ways that a doctor's hand cannot.
Doctors say such a robotic operation will make possible safer and better operations in the future. They say it will improve doctor training. It will also mean that doctors could do an operation on people in dangerous places far away. And it could mean that people could have operations done by top doctors without having to travel to the city where doctors work. 
 Question:We use the robot in the operation because   _  . 
A. it can send messages at a high speed 
B. even a top doctor can't do the operation himself 
C. it can make the operation safer and better 
D. operations can be done without any doctors

Context: More than four decades ago British scientist Robert Edwards first witnessed the miracle of human life growing inside a test tube at his Cambridge lab. Since that ground-breaking moment, more than four million babies have been born through IVF and in 2010 his great contribution to science was finally recognized as he was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine.
The prize for Dr Edwards, who was given a Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Award in 2008, includes a PS900,000 cheque. The Nobel Assembly described IVF as a ""milestone in modern medicine"".
With the help of fellow scientist Patrick Steptoe, the Manchester-born physiologist developed IVF -- leading to the birth of the world's first test tube baby. Dr Steptoe died 10 years later but their work has transformed fertility treatment and given hope to millions of couples.
It was a scientific breakthrough that transformed the lives of millions of couples. They said: ""His achievements have made it possible to treat infertility, a disease which makes human unable to have a baby. This condition has been afflicting a large percentage of mankind including more than 10% of all couples worldwide.""
Louise Brown, the world's first test tube baby, made international headlines when she was born in Oldham, Gtr Manchester, in 1978 to parents Lesley and John who had been fruitlessly trying for a baby since 1969.
Ivf-in-vitro fertilisation is the process whereby egg cells are fertilised outside the body before being implanted in the womb. After a cycle of IVF, the probability of a couple with infertility problems having a baby is one in five -- the same as healthy couples who conceive naturally.
Professor Edwards, who has five daughters and 11 grandchildren, began his research at Cambridge University in 1963, after receiving his PhD in 1955.He once said: ""The most important thing in life is having a child. Nothing is more special than a child."" With the help of fellow scientist Patrick Steptoe, Prof. Edwards founded the Bourn Hall clinic in Cambridge shire, which now treats more than 900 women a year. Each year, more than 30,000 women in Britain now undergo IVF and 11,000 babies are born as a result of the treatment.
But his work attracted widespread criticism from some scientists and the Catholic Church who said it was ""unethical and immoral"".
Martin Johnson, professor of reproductive  sciences at the University of Cambridge, said the award was ""long overdue"". He said: ""We couldn't understand why the Nobel has come so late but he is delighted -- this is the cherry on the cake for him.""
Professor Edwards was too ill to give interviews but a statement released by his family said he was ""thrilled and delighted"". 
 Question:Why did Professor Edwards begin his research on tube baby? 
A. Because he thought it of great significance to have a child in life. 
B. Because the birthrate around the world was unexpectedly low then. 
C. Because a special child did make a difference to an ordinary family. 
D. Because his fellow scientist wanted to give hope to the unlucky couples. 
 Answer: A
Context: Many years ago, when I was working as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Lisa. The poor little girl had a very serious disease and was dying. The doctor had done his best but no medicine really worked. The only chance to save her seemed to be a blood transfusion  from her five-year-old brother. The little boy had the same disease before and had developed the antibodies  to fight the illness.
The doctor talked to the little boy about what they planned to do, and asked him if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate  for a moment. He took a deep breath and said, ""Yes, I'll do it if it can save Lisa.""
As the transfusion was going on, the little boy lay quietly in bed next to his sister. He looked at her and smiled all the time. When everything was done and the colour returned to his sister's face, his smile disappeared and he looked a little afraid. He looked up at the doctor and asked, "" Will I start to die now?""
He was too young to understand the doctor. He thought he would have to give all his blood to his sister, but he agreed. 
 Question:The doctor waited the little boy to   _  . 
A. give a11 his blood to his sister 
B. give some of his blood to his sister 
C. give his life to his sister 
D. get the same disease as his sister

Context: Ever feel like you've been hit on the head after a bad night's sleep? According to scientists, the thought isn't as unbelievable as it seems.
A study found going without sleep for just one night causes changes in the brain similar to those that occur after a blow to the head. The researchers said the healthy young men examined in the study showed a sudden increase in the same chemicals which indicate brain damage. Professor Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, Sweden, explained that the chemicals NSE and S-100B are biomarkers for brain damage, such as concussion . He said, ""What we found was their levels in the blood rose in the group that went without sleep for a night. This was not to the extent that would happen after a head injury, for instance, but it was still significant. During sleep, the brain cleans poisonous substances off itself.""
Benedict also said previous studies which linked a lack of sleep with increased risk of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis could applaud his study. The rise of the chemicals in the blood after sleep loss may suggest not getting enough sleep contributes to a loss of brain tissue, he explained. Benedict, whose study is published in the journalSleep, added, ""In conclusion, the findings of our experiment indicate a good night's sleep may be critical to maintaining brain health.""
A third of the UK population suffer from sleep-related problems, while the average person now sleeps for only seven hours a night, compared with almost nine a few decades ago. Many scientists believe irregular sleeping patterns lead to illnesses ranging from aches and pains to heart disease, while less than eight hours' sleep a night can lower the IQ the next day. 
 Question:What do we know about previous studies? 
A. They found reasons for brain disorders. 
B. Their findings were published inSleep. 
C. They were supported by Benedict's study. 
D. They focused on brain health. 
 Answer: C
Context: A single night of taking the drug Ecstasy   can cause serious brain damage and speed up the start of Parkinson's disease , scientists say. Just two or three Ecstasy tablets can permanently destroy brain cells that affect movement and reasoning, according to American research that links the drug to Parkinson's for the first time.
A study by a team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, involving squirrel monkeys and baboons   found that both species suffered permanent damage to key cells, which are lost in Parkinson's, after receiving three low doses of Ecstasy at three-hour periods.
The study is particularly important because baboons are one of the best animal models for the human brain. George Ricaurte, who led the research, said that the widespread abuse of drug might have caused severe damage. ""The most troubling result is that young adults using Ecstasy may be increasing their risk of developing Parkinsonism as they get older.""
Alan Leshner, a former director of the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, said, ""This study emphasizes the multi-aspect damage that Ecstasy causes to users. We've long known that repeated use damages brain cells. But this study shows that even very occasional  use can have long-lasting effects on many different brain systems. It sends an important message to young people: don't experiment with your own brain.""
Janet Betts, a mother whose teenage daughter Leah died after a single Ecstasy tablet in 1995, said, ""This comes as no surprise. But people can't see the effects at first, and they say it won't happen to them. We'll see the symptoms later, just as we have with smoking."" 
 Question:The article is intended to   _  . 
A. explain the bad effects of drugs on people's health

 Answer: B
Context: ""Mind over matter"" is an English saying meaning that we can control our bodies with our minds. Now scientists are finding increasing evidence that our mind can have a great effect on our physical health. Since our mind influences how we feel, it's not true to say if someone is ill just because he feels ill.
The influence of the mind on how well we feel is the basis of what is known as the placebo effect. A placebo (which is Latin for ""I shall please"") is a harmless, inactive substance. Patients are sometimes given placebo pills and begin to feel better because they believe that they have been given real drugs and expect to respond to them. The placebo effect is very strong: research on pain suggests that up to 30% of the effect of most painkillers is a placebo effect.
So if it is so powerful, why don't doctors use it today?
According to Dr Persaud, they really do. ""All these things like seeing a doctor, going to a hospital, and being scanned  have a very strong placebo effect,"" he says.

Context: People who have lost the ability to understand or use words due to brain damage are called aphasics . Such patients can be extremely good at something else. From the changing expressions on speakers' faces and the tones of their voices, they can tell lies from truths.
Doctors studying the human brain have given a number of examples of this amazing power of aphasics. Some have even compared this power to that of a dog with an ability to find out the drugs hidden in the baggage.
Recently, scientists carried out tests to see if all that was said about aphasics was true. They studied a mixed group of people. Some were normal; others were aphasics. It was proved that the aphasics were far ahead of the normal people in recognizing false speeches -- in most cases, the normal people were fooled by words, but the aphasics were not.
Some years ago, Dr. Oliver Sacks wrote in his book about his experiences with aphasics. He mentioned a particular case in a hospital. Some aphasics were watching the president giving a speech on TV. Since the president had been an actor earlier, making a good speech was no problem for him. He was trying to put his feelings into every word of his speech.
But his way of speaking had the opposite effect on the patients. They didn't seem to believe him. Instead, they burst into laughter. The aphasics knew that the president did not mean a word of what he was saying. He was lying!
Many doctors see aphasics as people who are not completely normal because they lack the ability to understand words. However, according to Dr. Sacks, they are more gifted than normal people. Normal people may get carried away by words. Aphasics seem to understand human expressions better, though they cannot understand words. 
 Question:How did the scientists study aphasics? 
A. By asking them to watch TV together. 
B. By comparing them with normal people. 
C. By organizing them into acting groups. 
D. By giving them chances to speak on TV. 
 Answer: B
Context: Two years ago, Wendy Hasnip, 47, experienced a brain injury that left her speechless for two weeks. When she finally recovered, she found herself talking with what seemed to be a French accent: ""I phoned a friend the other day, and she spent the first ten minutes laughing,"" Hasnip said at the time. ""While I have nothing against the French.""
Hasnip suffered from foreign accent syndrome , a rare condition in which people find themselves speaking their own language Like someone from a foreign country. The condition usually occurs in people who have experienced a head injury or a stroke a sudden loss of consciousness, sensation, or movement caused by a blocked or broken blood vessel in the brain.
The condition was first identified during the Second World War in a Norwegian woman whose head was injured during an attack by the German military. The woman recovered but was left with a German-sounding accent, to the horror of fellow villagers who avoided her after that.
Researchers have discovered that the combined effect of the damage to several parts of the brain makes victims lengthen certain syllables, mispronounce sounds, and change,the normal pitch of their voice. Those changes in speech add up to what sounds like a foreign accent.
Another researcher, a phonetician ,says victims of the syndrome don't acquire a true foreign accent. Their strangely changed speech only resembles the foreign: accent with which it has a few sounds in common.
When an English woman named Annie recently developed foreign accent syndrome after a stroke, she spoke with what seemed to be a Scottish accent.
However, Annie's Scottish coworkers said she didn't sound at all like a Scot. 
 Question:If a person suffers foreign accent syndrome  _  . 
A. his coworkers will be afraid of him and avoid contacting with him 
B. he has more chance of suffering stroke again 
C. he will speak a fluent foreign language like native speakers' 
D. his speech only has a few sounds in common with the foreign accent

Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation.
""The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,"" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery.
The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are ""extremely difficult, if not impossible"" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said.
The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face.
The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants,
Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue.
Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality
There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers.
Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant. 
 Question:The best title for the passage would be   _  . 
A. French Woman has First Partial Face Transplant 
B. First Face Transplant Opens Debate 
C. Risks and Ethical Problems of a Face Transplant 
D. A Complete Face Transplant of a French Woman

Context: My teachers suggested that I see a speech specialist   in school.
I never really gave much thought to my speech. If other people understood what I was saying, then that was good enough. I didn't mind repeating myself many times.
Before testing me, the speech specialist asked me what I thought of having good speech. I told her I thought it was not important.
""Well, when you are in an interview for a job, and they don't know what you are saying, what are they going to say to you? Nice meeting you, bye,"" she said.
Maybe good speech was important. I took part in 20-minute classes each week with the specialist.
After she tested me, she told me that I spoke too fast, and didn't give enough eye contact  . I learned that when I made eye contact with someone, it meant that I was talking to that person, and I could also see what he or she thought about what I was saying.
When my first speech class started, I found that I had been speaking too fast to be understood. Every time I spoke too fast, the specialist stopped me and told me to start again. At first, I got stopped after almost every other sentence. After a while, I felt my speech slow down. I wasn't sure if people could understand me better, but my friends stopped asking me to repeat myself.
Speech is an important skill to have. If you do have good speech, that's a good thing, but if you don't have it, it is never too late to improve. 
 Question:From the sentence ""but my friends stopped asking me to repeat myself,"" we know that   _  . 
A. the writer's friends couldn't understand him 
B. the writer still couldn't make eye contact 
C. the writer improved a lot 
D. the writer didn't slow down

Context: Height is just one of the thousands of features your genes decide. In fact, because you have two parents, your genes provide you a height that usually lands somewhere between the height of each parent. If both your parents are tall, then most probably you will be tall, too, but if you have questions about how tall you're going to be, ask your doctor if he or she can help you find it out.
But genes don't decide everything. For example, eating an unhealthy diet can keep you from growing to your ideal height. Getting plenty of sleep and enough exercise will help you grow to the expected height.
No doubt you're wondering how fast you should grow. It depends. There's no perfect or right answer. Generally speaking, kids grow about 2 inches (6 centimeters) a year between age 3 and the time when they start puberty (when your body starts changing and becoming more grown up).
Your doctor will know how your growth has been going over the years. Two centimeters here and 2 inches there are not nearly as important as the height you're at now, how you've been growing up to this point, and what other changes your body may be going through.
Don't be scared if you seem to have grown a lot in a very short time. Everyone has a growth spurt  during puberty. The age for starting puberty is about 10 for girls and about 11 for boys. But it can be earlier or later ---between 7 and 13 for girls and 9 and 15 for boys.
You'll usually begin to notice that you're growing faster about a year or so after your body starts to show the first changes of puberty. 
 Question:This passage is mainly about   _  . 
A. how the genes work in your body 
B. when is the time you grow fast 
C. why you look like your parents 
D. how you grow to a certain height

Context: A new study shows that fat people in the United States suffer direct economic and social effects because of their size. The findings are from an 8-year study of about 100,000 people. The people who were studied were between the age of 18 and 24 when the research began.
The researchers who carried out the study say they consider the people fat if they are in the top of 5% of the measurement in which weight is linked to height. For example, fat women in the study were about 160 centimeters tall and weighed about 90 kilograms. Fat men in the study were about 175 centimeters tall and weighed 100 kilograms. The researchers say that more than 1,000,000 Americans are that big. The researchers found that fat young women were from wealthy families. The fat women also were 20% less likely to get married and they earned an average of about $6,700 a year less than other women. The study showed less
effects on fat men. They earned an average of about $3,000 a year less than other men. Fat men also were 11% less likely to get married. 
 Question:The passage mainly tells us    _   . 
A. the standards of fat people

Context: When most of us look at our hands, we might notice that we need to clean, or stop biting our fingernails, and that's about it. But if you ask a doctor, he can see a whole lot more. Everything from poor diet and stress to serious kidney   problems can be revealed by a glance at your fingernails.
There are about 30 different nail signs that can be associated with medical issues, though may indicate more than one problem, according to Dr.Amy Derick, a clinical instructor of dermatology at Northwestern University.
Here are five of the things a doctor can tell about your health based on your fingernails.
1. People who aren't eating well and lack vitamin or dietary may have thinner than normal nails, which are more likely to break.
2.Horizontal   lines are associated with serious physical stress. They frequently occur in people who have gone through chemotherapy .They can also occur after some illnesses, injuries, or with severe malnourishment .Interestingly, there may be an altitude connection too. They've also been found in people who dove 1,000 feet and others who participated in an Everest exploration.
3. Vertical  lines, however, are generally not such a big deal. Some people are more genetically prone to them than others, but they're commonly associated with aging.
4. When people lack iron, their nails can turn spoon-like. Instead of curving down and covering the finger normally, they 'll start to rise up on the sides and front, like the part of a spoon that holds liquid.
5. Kidney and liver problems can create ""half-and-half nails"", where one part of the nail is white and the other part dark or pink, according to Derick.
Doctors note that because disease diagnosis is complex and some symptoms can be associated with different diseases, you should always see a medical professional if you are concerned about something you notice. 
 Question:Who will have horizontal lines on the nails ? 
A. A cancer patient who has received normal treatment. 
B. Hungry African children suffering from severe malnourishment. 
C. An explorer who had reached Zhangjiajie in Hunan Province. 
D. A patient with serious illness, like kidney and liver problems. 
 Answer: B
Context: There are various reasons why cancers appear to be on the increase. For one thing, though their sufferers are to be found in all age groups, cancers are particularly likely to attack persons in their middle and advanced years. Naturally, since people live longer these years, there are more cancer sufferers than before. Again, with better methods of diagnosis  , doctors can more easily recognize cancerous growths that would formerly have passed unnoticed or that would have been wrongly diagnosed. It is also believed that certain habits and conditions of modern living, including heavy smoking and the pollution of the air, may leave people living in more cancer-causing conditions than before.
We all look forward to the day when a simple medical test can find cancer while it is still small. Researchers around the world are working on _ . Most of their work deals with the examination of the blood.
Researchers in Boston have found something in the blood of cancer patients that does not appear in healthy persons. The test showed which persons had cancer and which did not. It was correct more than 90 percent of the time.
The researchers believe the test may be able to show cancer very clearly in its development. Cancers discovered early usually can be treated successfully.
The test examines very small bits of fat in the blood called lipids  . Cancers seem to change lipids although doctors do not know why. The test showed differences between the lipids of the persons with cancer and the lipids of those without cancer.
The researchers say the new test could be a step to develop a simple way to check patients for cancer before the disease shows on an X-ray. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. A simple way to cancer 
B. Cancers can be cured 
C. How to find cancer 
D. Early discovery of cancer 
 Answer: D
Context: My parents have certainly had their troubles, and as their child I'll never know how they made it to 38 years of marriage. They loved each other, but they didn't seem to like each other very much. Dad was too fond of his beer, and he talked down to Mom a lot. When she tried to stand up to him, a fight would unavoidably follow.
It was my dad's disease that began to change things. The year 1998 was the beginning of a remarkable transformation for my family. My father, Jim Dineen, the always healthy, weightlifting, never-missed-a-day-of-work kind of dad, discovered he had kidney  disease.
The decision to go ahead with a transplant for my father was a long and tough one, mostly because he had liver damage too. One physician's assistant told him, ""According to your file, you're supposed to be dead."" And for a while, doctors mistakenly thought that he would need not just a kidney transplant, but a liver transplant too. _ 
When the donor testing process finally began in the spring of 2003, numerous people, including me, my uncle Tom, and my mom, came back as matches of varying degree. But Mom was the one who insisted on going further. She decided to donate a kidney to my father. She said she was not scared, and it was the right thing to do. We all stepped back in amazement.
At last a date was chosen - November 11, 2003. All of a sudden, the only thing that seemed to matter Dad was telling the world what a wonderful thing Mom was doing for him. A month before the surgery, he sent her birthday flowers with a note that read, ""I love you and I love your kidney! Thank you!""
Financially, the disease was upsetting to them. So my sister and I were humbled and surprised when, shortly before his surgery day, Dad handed us a diamond jewelry that we were to give to Mom after the operation. He'd accumulated his spare dollars to buy it.
At the hospital on the day of the transplant, all our relatives and friends gathered in the waiting room and became involved in a mean euchre   tournament. My family has always handled things with a lot of laughter, and even though we were all tense, everybody was taking bets on how long this ""change of conduct"" would last in my parents.
We would inform Dad that if he chose to act like a real pain on any particular day after the operation, he wasn't allowed to blame it on PMS just because he'd now have a female kidney.
The surgeries went well, and not long afterward, my sister and I were allowed to go in to visit. Dad was in a great deal of pain but again, all he could talk about was Mom. Was she okay? How was she feeling? Then the nurses let us do something unconventional. As they were wheeling Mom out of recovery room, they rolled her into a separate position to visit Dad. It was strange to see both my parents hooked up to IVs and machines and trying to talk to each other through tears. The nurses allowed us to present the diamond jewelry to Mom so that Dad could watch her open it. Everyone was crying, even the nurses.
As I stood with digital camera in hand, I tried to keep the presence of mind to document the moment. My dad was having a hard time fighting back emotion, and suddenly my parents unexpectedly reached out to hold each other's hands.
In my nearly 35 years of existence, I'd never seen my parents do that, and I was spellbound. I snapped a picture and later rushed home to make sure I'd captured that enormous, life-defining moment. After so many years of disagreement, it was apparent to me that they finally understood how much each loved the other. 
 Question:What's the best title for the passage? 
A. Dad's disease 
B. Mom's decision 
C. The Gift of Life 
D. The photo of hands

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. "" 
 Question:Jennie gave her bone marrow to   _  . 
A. a close friend 
B. a stranger 
C. a classmate 
D. a

Context: People who are worried about bad breath often reach for a toothbrush or a gun. But in the future, personal breath monitoring may include far more than fresh breath.
In face, breath is so rich in chemical compounds that fully understanding it has proved challenging. Each breath contains gases like carbon dioxide, the volatile remains of recent snacks, medicines and even compounds taken in from things like carpeting or various kinds of air pollution. But breath detectors  can sort out these substances with increasing sensitivity . 
Scientists are building electronic sniffers that examine the exhaled air for signs of cancer, asthma , and other diseases.
""There are clear signatures in the breath for liver disease, kidney disease and heart disease. Breath is a rich mixture that can reflect out state of health and disease."" said Dr. Raed Dweik, director of the Cleveland Clinic, adding ""Breath analysis is the future of medical testing.""
He and his partners are testing a desktop system called BreathLink for use in rapid identification of diseases. The system is designed to work wherever there is an Internet connection. To use BreathLink, a person breathes into a long tube, and a breath sample is collected and analyzed within the system. Then it can detail chemical concentrations of the breath in graphics. Dr. Raed Dweik said, ""If you examine patients of asthma, you will find they have higher levels of nitric oxide  in their exhaled air. It reflects their abnormal symptoms in the lungs."" His tests have reached 85 percent accuracy so far in spotting people with some illness.
But some trained dogs, he pointed out, can sniff out cancer with 99 percent accuracy--although without the ability to identify particular compounds the way some detectors can.
""We are getting better and better,"" he said. ""But whether we will ever approach the accuracy of the dog--we don't know."" 
 Question:It can be inferred that  _ 
A. brushing teeth can improve one's bad breath 
B. there are leftovers like snacks and medicines in one's breath 
C. one can know exactly about his physical state through the breath 
D. breath analysis can be helpful in medical diagnosis

Context: Perhaps the most famous theory, the study of body movement, was suggested by Professor Ray Birdwhistell. He believes that physical appearance is often culturally programmed. In other words, we learn our looks ---- we are not born with them. A baby has generally informed face features. A baby, according to Birdwhistell, learns where to set the eyebrows by looking at those around-family and friends. This helps explain why the people of some areas of the United States look so much alike, new Englanders or Southerners have certain common face features that cannot be explained by genetics . The exact shape of the mouth is not set at birth, it is learned after. In fact, the final mouth shape is not formed until well after new teeth are set. For many, this can be well into grown-ups. A husband and wife together for a long time often come to look alike. We learn our looks from those around us. This is perhaps why in a single country area people smile more than those in other areas. In the United States, for example, the South is the part of the country where the people smile most frequently. In New England they smile less, and in the western part of New York State still less. Many southerners find cities such as New York cold and unfriendly, partly because people on Madison Avenue smile less than people on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. People in largely populated areas also smile and greet each other in public less than people in small towns do. 
 Question:Ray Birdwhistell believes that physical appearance   _  . 
A. has little to do with culture 
B. has much to do with culture 
C. is ever changing 
D. is different from place to place

Context: One baby born with a defective windpipe   now has hope of breathing normally thanks to 3-D printing technology, NPR reported.
Garrett Peterson, now 18 months old, was born with tracheomalacia  , leaving him unable to breathe. The condition terrified his parents, who turned to specialist Dr. Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment.
Along with Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer who runs the university's 3-D printing lab, Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett's windpipe until it's strong enough to function independently. After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the ""splint"" with a 3-D printer.
""It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,"" Green told NPR.
On January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs?
Though he still remains in the hospital, Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery.  His parents are overjoyed, saying he's starting to act more interactive and alert.
As Garrett grows, the splint will expand and eventually dissolve in his body as his own windpipe strengthens enough to work independently.
3-D printing technology has allowed doctors to help patients in ways that they hope will continue to grow.
""We're talking about taking something like dust and converting it into body parts,"" Green said. ""And we're able to do things that were never possible before."" 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that   _  . 
A. Garrett is out of hospital with the help of 3-D printing technology. 
B. The splint will exist in Garrett's body for ever. 
C. It is difficult to operate the 3-D printer. 
D. Garrett's condition is critical.

After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the ""splint"" with a 3-D printer.
""It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,"" Green told NPR.
On January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs?
Though he still remains in the hospital, Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery.  His parents are overjoyed, saying he's starting to act more interactive and alert.
As Garrett grows, the splint will expand and eventually dissolve in his body as his own windpipe strengthens enough to work independently.
3-D printing technology has allowed doctors to help patients in ways that they hope will continue to grow.
""We're talking about taking something like dust and converting it into body parts,"" Green said. ""And we're able to do things that were never possible before.""

Context: More than four decades ago British scientist Robert Edwards first witnessed the miracle of human life growing inside a test tube at his Cambridge lab. Since that ground-breaking moment, more than four million babies have been born through IVF and in 2010 his great contribution to science was finally recognized as he was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine.
The prize for Dr Edwards, who was given a Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Award in 2008, includes a PS900,000 cheque. The Nobel Assembly described IVF as a ""milestone in modern medicine"".
With the help of fellow scientist Patrick Steptoe, the Manchester-born physiologist developed IVF -- leading to the birth of the world's first test tube baby. Dr Steptoe died 10 years later but their work has transformed fertility treatment and given hope to millions of couples.
It was a scientific breakthrough that transformed the lives of millions of couples. They said: ""His achievements have made it possible to treat infertility, a disease which makes human unable to have a baby. This condition has been afflicting a large percentage of mankind including more than 10% of all couples worldwide.""
Louise Brown, the world's first test tube baby, made international headlines when she was born in Oldham, Gtr Manchester, in 1978 to parents Lesley and John who had been fruitlessly trying for a baby since 1969.
Ivf-in-vitro fertilisation is the process whereby egg cells are fertilised outside the body before being implanted in the womb. After a cycle of IVF, the probability of a couple with infertility problems having a baby is one in five -- the same as healthy couples who conceive naturally.
Professor Edwards, who has five daughters and 11 grandchildren, began his research at Cambridge University in 1963, after receiving his PhD in 1955.He once said: ""The most important thing in life is having a child. Nothing is more special than a child."" With the help of fellow scientist Patrick Steptoe, Prof. Edwards founded the Bourn Hall clinic in Cambridge shire, which now treats more than 900 women a year. Each year, more than 30,000 women in Britain now undergo IVF and 11,000 babies are born as a result of the treatment.
But his work attracted widespread criticism from some scientists and the Catholic Church who said it was ""unethical and immoral"".
Martin Johnson, professor of reproductive  sciences at the University of Cambridge, said the award was ""long overdue"". He said: ""We couldn't understand why the Nobel has come so late but he is delighted -- this is the cherry on the cake for him.""
Professor Edwards was too ill to give interviews but a statement released by his family said he was ""thrilled and delighted"". 
 Question:Why did Professor Edwards begin his research on tube baby? 
A. Because he thought it of great significance to have a child in life. 
B. Because the birthrate around the world was unexpectedly low then. 
C. Because a special child did make a difference to an ordinary family. 
D. Because his fellow scientist wanted to give hope to the unlucky couples. 
 Answer: A
Context: My mother fought cancer for almost a decade and died at 56. She held out long enough to meet the first of her grandchildren and to hold him in her arms. But my other children will never have the chance to know her and experience how loving and gracious she was.
We often speak of ""Mommy's mommy,"" and I find myself trying to explain the illness that took her away from us. They have asked if the same could happen to me. I have always told them not to worry, but the truth is that I carry a ""faulty"" gene, BRCA1, which sharply increases my risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian  cancer.
My doctors estimated that I had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman.
Once I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much as I could. I started with the breasts, as my risk of breast cancer is higher than my risk of ovarian cancer, and the surgery is more complex.
On April 27, I finished the three months of medical procedures. During that time I have been able to keep this private and to carry on with my work. But I am writing about it now because I hope that other women can benefit from my experience. Cancer is still a word that strikes fear into people's hearts, producing a deep sense of powerlessness. But today it is possible to find the way out through a blood test whether you are highly susceptible to breast and ovarian cancer, and then take action.
My own process began on February 2. The operation took eight hours. Then I woke up with tubes in my breasts. It did feel like a scene out of a science-fiction film. But days after surgery I can be back to a normal life. There have been many advances in this procedure in the last few years, and the results can be beautiful.
I wanted to write this to tell other women that the decision to have a surgery operation was not easy. But it is one I am very happy that I made. My chances of developing breast cancer have dropped from 87 percent to under 5 percent. I can tell my children that they don't need to fear they will lose me.
It is a comfort that they see nothing that makes them scared. They can see my small scars and that's it. Everything else is just Mommy, the same as she always was. And they know that I love them and I will do anything to be with them as long as I can. On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. 
For any woman reading this, I hope it helps you to know you have options. I want to encourage every woman, especially if you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, to seek out the information and medical experts who can help you through this aspect of your life, and to make your own informed choices.
I acknowledge that there are many wonderful holistic doctors working on alternatives to surgery. My own regimen  will be posted in due course on the Web site of the Pink Lotus Breast Center. I hope that this will be helpful to other women.
I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they can take measures.
Life comes with many challenges. The ones that should not scare us are the ones we can take on and take control of.

Context: The Albinas married when Mr. Albina was 30, and they spent the early marriage in Argentina. Then they decided to move to Chile, which meant they had to cross the Andes Mountains. They and their 20s sons made the difficult two-week journey on horses. One night there was a terrible snow storm in the mountains, during which Mrs Albina gave birth to triplets  , a boy and two girls.
Mrs Albina now has 30 more girls, including the twins who are 15 months old. The oldest Albina children are in their 30s and 40s. They are on their own now, but 18 of the kids still live with their parents in a two-room house. The house has electricity but no toilet or running water. Clearly, the Albinas don't have enough money and food for the big family. Why, then, do they continue to have children?
The Albinas do not use birth control because it is against their religion. They can let other people take care of their kids, but Mrs Albina doesn't allow it. ""When we were babies,"" she said, ""our mother left us at an orphanage and never returned. Then a couple adopted my brothers, and I was left behind. I was heartbroken. I promised that when I became a mother I would never give my children away.""
So the Albina family continues to grow. They have so many kids that they run out of names and have to give some children the same name. There are three Susannas, three Miriams, two Estrellas, and two Soledades.
Will the family stop at 53 kids? Mr Albina is 77, and Mrs Albina is 59. ""I am getting old,"" she said with a smile, ""and I would like God to think of me and consider my age. But if God sends more children to me, yes, there will be more."" 
 Question:It can be inferred from the passage that  _  . 
A. Mrs Albina experienced a hard childhood 
B. the Albinas would like to use birth control 
C. ten kids in the family share the same name 
D. the Albina family has lived in three countries

Context: Why is 2004 a special year? Because it is a Leap Year  .
What's so special about that? Well, we have a Leap Year every four years. And it has 366 days, not the usual   365. In a Leap Year, we have 29 days in February, while in a usual year we have only 28 days.
Why do we have a Leap Year? We have a Leap Year so we can keep the calendar   in step with the seasons. The calendar is a kind of clock for the year. But how long is a year? A calendar year is 365 days. But a true year is 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds long. That's the time it takes the earth to go around the sun. So every four years we have one more day, and we put it at the end of February, the shortest month of a year. Then we have a Leap Year.

Context: One baby born with a defective windpipe   now has hope of breathing normally thanks to 3-D printing technology, NPR reported.

Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body.
It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients.
First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday.
Although most people are able to give blood, some people who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease are no tasked to be donors. Pregnant women or those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood.
Blood has a very short shelf life. Some blood components can be kept longer than others, for instance red blood cells will keep for 35 days but platelets for only five. Remember, you should wait at least 16 weeks before donating blood again. 
 Question:What component of blood is used to treat burned patients?

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. "" 
 Question:Jennie gave her bone marrow to   _  . 
A. a close friend 
B. a stranger 
C. a classmate 
D. a

Context: It's impossible to determine how many people would have lost their lives without the contribution of African-American inventor Dr Charles Drew.
Charles Drew was born on June 3, 1904, in Washington, DC. His early interest was in education, but he was also an outstanding athlete. While in college, he was awarded as the man who contributed the most to sports during his four years in school. Drew's sister Elsie suffered from tuberculosis  and died in 1920. Her death influenced his decision to study medicine.
After becoming a doctor and working as a college instructor, Drew went to Columbia University, where he earned his Doctor of Medical Science degree. During this time he became involved in research on blood and blood transfusions.
At Columbia, he wrote a paper on ""banked blood"", in which he described a technique he developed for the long-term preservation of blood plasma. Before his discovery, blood could not be stored for more than two days because of the rapid breakdown of red blood cells. Drew had discovered that by separating the plasma from the whole blood and then refrigerating them separately, they could be combined a week later for a blood transfusion. Drew became the first African American to receive a PhD in medical science.
After World War II broke out, Drew was called upon to put his techniques into practice. He was named a project director for the American Red Cross but soon quit his post after the government issued an order that blood taken from white donors should be separated from that of black donors.
On April 1, 1950, after he attended the annual free clinic at the John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, he and other three physicians decided to drive back home. As he was tired from spending the night before in the operating room, he lost control of his car. Drew was badly injured and was taken to Alamance General Hospital in Burlington, North Carolina. He was pronounced dead half an hour after he first received medical attention. Drew's funeral was held on April 5, 1950, at the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church in Washington, DC.
But contrary to popular thought, he was not refused a blood transfusion by an all-white hospital. He indeed received a transfusion but was beyond the help of the doctors attending to him. As Dr. John Ford, one of the doctors who survived the accident, later explained, ""We all received the very best of care. The fact that he was a Black did not in any way limit the care that was given to him."" Over the years, Drew has been considered one of the most honored figures in the medical field. 
 Question:According to the passage,   _   might have contributed to the invention of blood banks. 
A. the combination of blood cells 
B. the rapid breakdown of red blood cells 
C. the development of refrigerating technique 
D. the technique of separating plasma from the whole blood

Context: There are various reasons why cancers appear to be on the increase. For one thing, though their sufferers are to be found in all age groups, cancers are particularly likely to attack persons in their middle and advanced years. Naturally, since people live longer these years, there are more cancer sufferers than before. Again, with better methods of diagnosis  , doctors can more easily recognize cancerous growths that would formerly have passed unnoticed or that would have been wrongly diagnosed. It is also believed that certain habits and conditions of modern living, including heavy smoking and the pollution of the air, may leave people living in more cancer-causing conditions than before.
We all look forward to the day when a simple medical test can find cancer while it is still small. Researchers around the world are working on _ . Most of their work deals with the examination of the blood.
Researchers in Boston have found something in the blood of cancer patients that does not appear in healthy persons. The test showed which persons had cancer and which did not. It was correct more than 90 percent of the time.
The researchers believe the test may be able to show cancer very clearly in its development. Cancers discovered early usually can be treated successfully.
The test examines very small bits of fat in the blood called lipids  . Cancers seem to change lipids although doctors do not know why. The test showed differences between the lipids of the persons with cancer and the lipids of those without cancer.
The researchers say the new test could be a step to develop a simple way to check patients for cancer before the disease shows on an X-ray. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. A simple way to cancer 
B. Cancers can be cured 
C. How to find cancer 
D. Early discovery of cancer 
 Answer: D
Context: My mother fought cancer for almost a decade and died at 56. She held out long enough to meet the first of her grandchildren and to hold him in her arms. But my other children will never have the chance to know her and experience how loving and gracious she was.
We often speak of ""Mommy's mommy,"" and I find myself trying to explain the illness that took her away from us. They have asked if the same could happen to me. I have always told them not to worry, but the truth is that I carry a ""faulty"" gene, BRCA1, which sharply increases my risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian  cancer.
My doctors estimated that I had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman.
Once I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much as I could. I started with the breasts, as my risk of breast cancer is higher than my risk of ovarian cancer, and the surgery is more complex.
On April 27, I finished the three months of medical procedures. During that time I have been able to keep this private and to carry on with my work. But I am writing about it now because I hope that other women can benefit from my experience. Cancer is still a word that strikes fear into people's hearts, producing a deep sense of powerlessness. But today it is possible to find the way out through a blood test whether you are highly susceptible to breast and ovarian cancer, and then take action.
My own process began on February 2. The operation took eight hours. Then I woke up with tubes in my breasts. It did feel like a scene out of a science-fiction film. But days after surgery I can be back to a normal life. There have been many advances in this procedure in the last few years, and the results can be beautiful.
I wanted to write this to tell other women that the decision to have a surgery operation was not easy. But it is one I am very happy that I made. My chances of developing breast cancer have dropped from 87 percent to under 5 percent. I can tell my children that they don't need to fear they will lose me.
It is a comfort that they see nothing that makes them scared. They can see my small scars and that's it. Everything else is just Mommy, the same as she always was. And they know that I love them and I will do anything to be with them as long as I can. On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. 
For any woman reading this, I hope it helps you to know you have options. I want to encourage every woman, especially if you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, to seek out the information and medical experts who can help you through this aspect of your life, and to make your own informed choices.
I acknowledge that there are many wonderful holistic doctors working on alternatives to surgery. My own regimen  will be posted in due course on the Web site of the Pink Lotus Breast Center. I hope that this will be helpful to other women.
I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they can take measures.
Life comes with many challenges. The ones that should not scare us are the ones we can take on and take control of.

Context: In a society where lung and breast cancers are leading causes of cancer death worldwide, early detection of the disease is highly desirable. In a new scientific study, researchers present astonishing new evidence that man's best friend, the dog, may have the ability to contribute to early cancer detection.
Researchers show scientific evidence that a dog's extraordinary smelling ability can distinguish people with both early and late stage lung and breast cancers from healthy people. Researchers first discovered this in the case report of a dog warning its owner to the presence of a melanoma   by constantly sniffing the skin lesion  . Later studies published in major medical magazines proved the ability of trained dogs to detect both melanomas and bladder cancers. The new study is the first to test whether dogs can detect cancers only by sniffing the breath of cancer patients.
In this study, five household dogs were trained within a short 3-week period to detect lung or breast cancer by sniffing the breath of cancer patients. The experiment consisted of 86 cancer patients (55 with lung cancer and 31 with breast cancer) and 83 healthy people. All cancer patients had recently been diagnosed with cancer and had not yet undergone any chemotherapy treatment  . The dogs were presented with breath samples from the cancer patients and the healthy ones, captured in a special tube. Dogs were trained to give a positive identification of a cancer patient by sitting or lying down directly in front of a test station containing a cancer patient sample, while ignoring healthy samples.
The results of the study showed that dogs can detect breast and lung cancer between 88% and 97%. Moreover, the study also proved that the trained dogs could even detect the early stages of lung cancer, as well as early breast cancer. The researchers concluded that breath analysis might become a potential of cancer diagnosis. 
 Question:The last sentence of the passage means_. 
A. doctors won't be worried about detecting cancers any more 
B. dogs will be the only way to detect cancers 
C. breath analysis can be used in diagnosing cancers in the future 
D. dogs can use its smell to identify people

Context: The technology is great. Without it we wouldn't have been able to put a man on the moon, explore the ocean's depths or eat microwave sausages. Computers have revolutionized our lives and they have the power to educate and pass on knowledge. But sometimes this power can create more problems than it solves.
Every doctor has had to try their best to calm down patients who've come into their surgery waving an Internet print-out, convinced that they have some rare incurable disease, say, throat cancer. The truth is usually far more ordinary, though: they don't have throat cancer, and it's just that their throats are swollen. Being a graduate of the Internet ""school"" of medicine does not guarantee accurate self-health-checks.
One day Mrs. Almond came to my hospital after feeling faint at work. While I took her blood sample and tried to find out what was wrong, she said calmly, ""I know what's wrong;I've got throat cancer. I know there's nothing you doctors can do about it and I've just got to wait until the day comes.""
As a matter of routine I ordered a chest X-ray. I looked at it and the blood results an hour later. Something wasn't right. ""Did your local doctor do an X-ray?"" I asked. ""Oh, I haven't been to the doctor for years,"" she replied. ""I read about it on a website and the symptoms fitted, so I knew that's what I had.""
However, some of her symptoms, like the severe cough and weight loss, didn't fit with it--but she'd just ignored this.
I looked at the X-ray again, and more tests confirmed it wasn't the cancer but tuberculosis  --something that most certainly did need treating, and could be deadly. She was lucky we caught it when we did.
Mrs. Almond went pale when I explained she would have to be on treatment for the next six months to ensure that she was fully recovered. It was certainly a lesson for her. "" _ ,"" she said, shaking her head, as I explained that all the people she had come into close contact with would have to be found out and tested. She listed up to about 20, and then I went to my office to type up my notes. Unexpectedly, the computer was not working, so I had to wait until someone from the IT department came to fix it. Typical. Maybe I should have a microwave sausage while I waited?

Context: One Sunday, my family had gathered at my parents' house to feast upon Mom's wonderful cooking. During the normal dinner chatter  , I noticed that my father was slurring   his words. No one mentioned this during dinner, but I felt compelled to discuss it with my mother afterward.
We decided that there was something seriously wrong and that Dad needed to see the doctor.
Mom phoned me two days later. ""The doctor found a brain tumor  . It's too large at this point to operate. Maybe they can do something then, but _ .""
Even with the treatment, my father's condition worsened, and the doctor finally informed us that this condition was terminal  . During one of his stays in the hospital, we brought our baby daughter Chelsey with us when we visited him. By this time he had great difficulty speaking. I finally figured out that he wanted Chelsey to sit on his stomach so he could make faces at her.
Watching the two of them together, I realized I was living an experience that would stay with me forever. Though grateful for the times they could share, I couldn't shake the feeling of a clock ticking in the background.
On the visit to my parents' home during what we all know was my father's last days, my mother took Chelsey from my arms and announced, ""Your father would like to see you alone for a minute.""
I entered the bedroom where my father lay on a rented hospital bed. He appeared even weaker than the day before.
""How are you feeling, Dad?"" I asked. ""Can I do anything for you?""
He tried to speak, but he couldn't make out a word.
""I'm sorry, but I can't understand you,"" I said.
With great difficulty he said, ""I love you.""

Context: The dodo is among the most famous extinct creatures, and _ for human-caused extinction events. Despite its bad name, and the fact that the species was alive during recorded human history, little is actually known about how this animal lived, looked, and behaved. A new study of the only known complete skeleton  from a single bird takes advantage of modern 3-D laser scanning  technology to open a new window into the life of this famous extinct bird.
The study was presented at the 74th Annual Meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in Estrel, Berlin. Leon Claessens, Associate Professor at the College of the Holy Cross, and lead researcher on the study said that, ""the 3-D laser surface scans we made of the fragile dodo skeletons enable us to reconstruct how the dodo walked, moved and lived to a level of detail that has never been possible before. There are so many outstanding questions about the dodo bird that we can answer with this new knowledge.""
A complete dodo skeleton, found by an amateur collector and barber, Etienne Thirioux, on the island of Mauritius between 1899 and 1917, has remained unstudied, even though it is the only complete dodo skeleton from a single individual bird known to exist. All other skeletons are incomplete combinations, meaning that they are gathered from more than one individual. In addition, Thirioux constructed a second, partially combined skeleton, which contains many bones that also belong to a single bird. ""Being able to examine the skeleton of a single, individual dodo, which is not made up from as many individual birds as there are bones, as is the case in all those other combined skeletons, truly allows us to appreciate the way the dodo looked and see how tall or fat it really was,"" said Juilan Hume, of the Natural History Museum UK, a co-author on the study.
The scans were performed on site in Durban, South Africa, and allow examination of the biology of this mysterious extinct bird in detail for the first time. Using the newest digital tools and techniques, the scans provide an insight into how the flightless dodo may have developed its giant size, and how it walked and lived in its forest home. According to Kenneth Rijsdijk, a biologist from University of Amsterdam, ""the skull of the dodo is so large and its mouth so strong that it is easy to understand that the earliest naturalists thought it was related to sharks and other birds of prey , rather than the pigeon family."" 
 Question:The researchers study the dodo skeleton to find out  _  . 
A. ways to save the dodo 
B. the dodo's living habits 
C. the bird's natural habitat 
D. the cause of the dodo's extinction 
 Answer: B
Context: If you were asked what your body is made of, probably you would say that it is made of flesh  and bones and covered with skin. You also know something about the blood which flows through it, and that there is a very important part which we call the brain.
But the flesh and the bones make up the largest part of the body, and there is a good deal to be learned about them. You know the general appearance of both flesh and bone from the parts of animals which you see in the butcher's shop.
Bone is hard, and of a white color; indeed, it looks more like a piece of wood or stone than a part of a living animal. But bone is a real part of the living body, and it grows and is nourished  just as the body is. If a man breaks the bone of his arm or his leg, it is firmly bound up, to prevent the broken parts from moving out of the proper places, and in time then bone grows together again and becomes quite strong.
The bones are fastened together by various kinds of joints . They form the framework of the body, and give it strength to retain its proper shape. This framework is called the skeleton . Some animals, such as worms and slugs, have no skeleton; and others, such as shellfish, have a kind of hard covering or skeleton outside.
The most important part of the skeleton is the backbone. It is so important that naturalists divide all animals into two classes,--- those which have a backbone and those which have none. All the higher animals, including man, have a backbone, or vertebral column as it is called. They are therefore called vertebrate  animals. The others are called invertebrate animals. 
 Question:From the passage, we know higher animals are called  _  . 
A. backbone 
B. human beings 
C. vertebrate animals 
D. skeleton 
 Answer: C
Context: A previously unknown kind of human group disappeared from the world so completely that it has left behind the merest piece of evidence that it ever existed -- a single bone from the little finger of a child, buried in a cave in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia. 
    Researchers removed DNA from the bone and reported that it differed obviously from that of both modern humans and of Neanderthals , living in Europe until the arrival of modern humans on the continent some 44,000 years ago. 
    The child carrying the DNA line was probably 5 to 7 years old, but it is not yet known if it was a boy or a girl. The finger bone was unearthed in 2008 from a place known as the Denisova cave. 
    Researchers are careful not to call the Denisova child a new human species, though it may prove to be so, because the evidence is initial. 
    But the genetic material removed from the bone, found in a layer laid down on the cave floor between 48,000 and 30,000 years ago, belonged to a distinct human line that traveled out of Africa at a different time from the two known ancient human species. Homo erectus , found in East Asia, left Africa two million years ago, and the ancestor of Neanderthals moved away some 500,000 years ago. The numbers of differences found in the child's DNA indicate that its ancestors left Africa about one million years ago. 
    The region was inhabited by both Neanderthals and modern humans at that time. Counting the new human line, three human species may have lived together. 
The standard view has long been that there were three human resettlements out of Africa -- those of Homo erectus; of the ancestor of Neanderthals; and finally, some 50,000 years ago, of modern humans. But in 2004, archaeologists reported that they had found the bones of small humans who lived on the Indonesian island of Flores until 13,000 years ago, causing a serious problem to this view. The new line is the second such challenge. 
If the nuclear DNA of the Denisova child should differ as much as its mitochondrial  DNA does from that of Neanderthals and modern humans, the case for declaring it a new species would be strengthened. But it would be unusual for a new species to be recognized on the basis of DNA alone. 
In new diggings starting this summer, archaeologists will look for remains more analytical than the finger bone. Researchers will also begin re-examining the fossil collections in museums to see if any wrongly assigned bones might belong instead to the new line. 
 Question:Which human line is the first challenge to the standard view of human resettlement? 
A. Neanderthals. 
B. Modern humans. 
C. Homo erectus. 
D. Small humans in Indonesia.

Context: There are various reasons why cancers appear to be on the increase. For one thing, though their sufferers are to be found in all age groups, cancers are particularly likely to attack persons in their middle and advanced years. Naturally, since people live longer these years, there are more cancer sufferers than before. Again, with better methods of diagnosis  , doctors can more easily recognize cancerous growths that would formerly have passed unnoticed or that would have been wrongly diagnosed. It is also believed that certain habits and conditions of modern living, including heavy smoking and the pollution of the air, may leave people living in more cancer-causing conditions than before.
We all look forward to the day when a simple medical test can find cancer while it is still small. Researchers around the world are working on _ . Most of their work deals with the examination of the blood.
Researchers in Boston have found something in the blood of cancer patients that does not appear in healthy persons. The test showed which persons had cancer and which did not. It was correct more than 90 percent of the time.
The researchers believe the test may be able to show cancer very clearly in its development. Cancers discovered early usually can be treated successfully.
The test examines very small bits of fat in the blood called lipids  . Cancers seem to change lipids although doctors do not know why. The test showed differences between the lipids of the persons with cancer and the lipids of those without cancer.
The researchers say the new test could be a step to develop a simple way to check patients for cancer before the disease shows on an X-ray. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. A simple way to cancer 
B. Cancers can be cured 
C. How to find cancer 
D. Early discovery of cancer

Context: One Sunday, my family had gathered at my parents' house to feast upon Mom's wonderful cooking. During the normal dinner chatter  , I noticed that my father was slurring   his words. No one mentioned this during dinner, but I felt compelled to discuss it with my mother afterward.
We decided that there was something seriously wrong and that Dad needed to see the doctor.
Mom phoned me two days later. ""The doctor found a brain tumor  . It's too large at this point to operate. Maybe they can do something then, but _ .""
Even with the treatment, my father's condition worsened, and the doctor finally informed us that this condition was terminal  . During one of his stays in the hospital, we brought our baby daughter Chelsey with us when we visited him. By this time he had great difficulty speaking. I finally figured out that he wanted Chelsey to sit on his stomach so he could make faces at her.
Watching the two of them together, I realized I was living an experience that would stay with me forever. Though grateful for the times they could share, I couldn't shake the feeling of a clock ticking in the background.
On the visit to my parents' home during what we all know was my father's last days, my mother took Chelsey from my arms and announced, ""Your father would like to see you alone for a minute.""
I entered the bedroom where my father lay on a rented hospital bed. He appeared even weaker than the day before.
""How are you feeling, Dad?"" I asked. ""Can I do anything for you?""
He tried to speak, but he couldn't make out a word.
""I'm sorry, but I can't understand you,"" I said.
With great difficulty he said, ""I love you.""
We don't learn courage from heroes on the evening news. We learn true courage from watching ordinary people rise above hopeless situations. In many ways my father was a strict, uncommunicative man. He found it difficult to show emotion. The bravest thing I ever saw him do was overcome that barrier to open his heart to his son and family at the end of his life. 
 Question:What does the writer attempt to tell us? 
A. We don't often value health until we lose it. 
B. Don't wait to see a doctor till it is too late.

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. ""

A. a close friend 
B. a stranger

Context: Every living thing on Earth is either a plant or an animal, right? Wrong! Many organisms in our world are neither. Some of them float through the air, and some lie hidden in the ground. They do not need sunlight to survive, and if the weather becomes too cold, they can become inactive until conditions improve.
What are these? They are called fungi , and you see them almost every day. Many kinds of fungi seem _ , such as the green black things that appear on the food which are left too long in the refrigerator. But other kinds are not so bad. For example, the yeast that is used to make bread and mushrooms   are both fungi.
What makes fungi different from plants and animals? An animal can move around by itself. Fungi get around too, but they don't have feet, wings, or tails. They have to wait for wind or some other outside force to move them. Plants are different from fungi because they have chlorophyll . It helps them make food from the energy in sunlight. Fungi do not have chlorophyll.
Some fungi are bad, while others are not. Some fungi cause diseases, such as athlete's foot, which makes feet uncomfortable. Other kinds of fungi can be used to make medicines, which have saved many lives.
Fungi clean up more than wounds, though. They are the world's first recyclers. Without fungi, our world would be a mess. Since fungi cannot make their own food as plants do, they must get their food elsewhere. Many fungi get their food from dead plants. They break them down and turn them into soil. The fungi get a meal, and the world gets a housecleaning. 
 Question:According to the passage,   _  . 
A. fungi can move everywhere by themselves 
B. fungi are unable to survive in cold conditions 
C. some fungi can make food from the energy in sunlight. 
D. some fungi are useful to humans and the environment

 Answer: D
Context: It is generally believed that we are getting cleaned when we step under a shower. We are, but we're also giving a home to lots of tiny little creatures we didn't even know about. A showerhead carries thousands of bacteria called Mycobacterium.These can cause problems like coughs and tiredness, and a general feeling of poorliness  . When you turn on the water, the bacteria go from the showerhead onto and into your body.
This is a finding of Norman R. Pace and his team at the University of Colorado, in the US. The scientists investigated bacteria in all kinds of human environment, including showers.Pace's team looked at 45 showerheads in nine American cities. They discovered that 30 percent of them had large amounts of flying Mycobacterium.
But Pace said that they _ few threats to the health.Only those with a weak immune system might need to worry.He told the New York Times that the bacteria are not as unpleasant as might be thought.He said that having a shower is no more dangerous than anything else we do in the morning.
But for those who feel sick about the idea of all those microorganisms  , he had some advice. Let the water run for 30 seconds before getting into the shower. Why? The number of bacteria is smaller than that when the water is just turned on. If that seems like a waste of water, he added that you could also change your showerhead every few months.
However, Pace had good news too. He has also been testing the air in US subways. Apart from iron particles  , which are ground off the track by the wheels of trains, subway air is fresh. The reason is that a train's movement pumps fresh outdoor air into the tunnels.
Pace explained that he wanted to understand the natural microbial environments of public places. This kind of knowledge might help discover the microbes to be used in a bioterrorist   attack. 
 Question:From the finding of Norman R. Pace, after taking a shower, we might cough or feel tired because  _  . 
A. it's easy to get a cold when taking a bath 
B. the showerhead carries many bacteria causing illness 
C. we don't get cleaned while showering 
D. we don't get a weak immune system

Context: Recently hand-foot-mouth disease has spread across China. In the past three months, there have been about 41,846 cases   in 30 provinces and regions. The number is increasing. Eighteen Chinese children have died of the disease so far this year.
What causes the disease and why is it dangerous?
Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common childhood illness. It mainly affects children under the age of 10. It gets its name from the rash   that develops on the hands and feet. It can also cause blisters   in your mouth.
A child who has the disease will usually have a fever, a runny nose and sore throat. He or she doesn't want to eat or drink because of pain in the mouth.
Hand-foot-mouth disease is mostly not serious. The fever and rash clear within a few days. But in some cases, the virus   affects the heart, lungs or brain. This puts the child's life in danger.
A virus causes hand-foot-mouth disease. The disease spreads easily where a lot of young children are together, such as in a child-care center. Sometimes it can also affect teenagers and adults.
In order not to pass on the virus, good hygiene   is important. We should wash our hands as often as possible. Especially we should wash our hands before meals and after going to the toilet. 
 Question:_   can help us to keep away from the hand-foot-mouth disease. 
A. Passing on the virus 
B. Taking children to the child-care center 
C. Keeping your hands clean 
D. Not going to public places

Context: When most of us look at our hands, we might notice that we need to clean, or stop biting our fingernails, and that's about it. But if you ask a doctor, he can see a whole lot more. Everything from poor diet and stress to serious kidney   problems can be revealed by a glance at your fingernails.
There are about 30 different nail signs that can be associated with medical issues, though may indicate more than one problem, according to Dr.Amy Derick, a clinical instructor of dermatology at Northwestern University.
Here are five of the things a doctor can tell about your health based on your fingernails.
1. People who aren't eating well and lack vitamin or dietary may have thinner than normal nails, which are more likely to break.
2.Horizontal   lines are associated with serious physical stress. They frequently occur in people who have gone through chemotherapy .They can also occur after some illnesses, injuries, or with severe malnourishment .Interestingly, there may be an altitude connection too. They've also been found in people who dove 1,000 feet and others who participated in an Everest exploration.
3. Vertical  lines, however, are generally not such a big deal. Some people are more genetically prone to them than others, but they're commonly associated with aging.
4. When people lack iron, their nails can turn spoon-like. Instead of curving down and covering the finger normally, they 'll start to rise up on the sides and front, like the part of a spoon that holds liquid.
5. Kidney and liver problems can create ""half-and-half nails"", where one part of the nail is white and the other part dark or pink, according to Derick.
Doctors note that because disease diagnosis is complex and some symptoms can be associated with different diseases, you should always see a medical professional if you are concerned about something you notice.

Context: Nuclear power's  danger to health, safety, and even life itself can be described in one word; radiation . Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery about it, partly because it cannot be detected   by human senses. It can't be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around us but we can't detect them, sense them, without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things. At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being completely by killing masses of cells   in important organs  . But even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no level of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be significant. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and if they are killed completely. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They reproduce themselves in an unusual way. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years.
This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the knowledge of the person at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiated  and feel fine, then die of cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. Or a child can be born weak or easy to get serious illness as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents. Radiation can hurt us. We must know the truth. 
 Question:Radiation can hurt us in the way that it can   _  . 
A. kill large numbers of cells in main organs so as to cause death immediately 
B. damage cells which may grow into cancer years later 
C. affect the healthy growth of our younger generation 
D. lead to all of the above results 
 Answer: D
Context: A Concussion  happens when the brain is shaken, often in a car crash or a fall or a strike on; the head in sports.Concussions can be mild, but doctors may order a CT scan to look for a more serious injury.But a recent study warned that more children than necessary are being exposed  to radiation this way.
A national team led by two doctors at the University of California, Davis, studied hospital records from thousands of children with head injuries. They found that in many cases, the risk of developing cancer from the radiation outweighed the risk of a serious brain injury.
The study found that one in five children over age two had a low risk of serious injury but received CT scans anyway. The same was true of almost one in four children under two years of age.
The researchers have developed rules to predict if a head injury is serious enough for a scan. For children under two, doctors are advised against it if there is:
*Normal mental activity.
*No swelling in the back of the head.
*No feeling of a broken bone in the skull.  
*And no loss of consciousness for more than five seconds.
Doctors should also consider how the child was injured and whether the parents say the child is acting normally.
For patients from two to eighteen, the guidelines are similar ---- except there should be no l vomiting and no severe headache.
Earlier this year, the British Journal of Sports Medicine published new guidelines for concussions in children and teens. International experts said they should not return to sports or school until fully recovered. The brain also needs a ""cognitive rest,"" they say, by restricting activities like video games, texting and watching TV.
It often take longer than adults to recover from a concussion than adults. The experts say individual progress and not a set time period should always guide a decision to return to play. 
 Question:How many aspects should doctors consider when deciding whether a child under two needs a CT scan? 
A. Four. 
B. Six. 
C. Seven. 
D. Nine.

Context: We discuss the issue of when to help a patient die. Doctors of our generation are not newcomers to this question. Going back to my internship days, I can remember many patients in pain, sometimes in coma , with late, hopeless cancer. For many of them, we wrote an order for heavy medication--morphine by the clock. This was not talked about openly and little was written about it. It was essential, not controversial.
The best way to bring the problem into focus is to describe two patients whom I cared for. The first, formerly a nurse, had an automobile accident. A few days later her lungs seemed to fill up; her heart developed dangerous rhythm disturbances. So there she was: in coma, on a breathing machine, her heartbeat maintained with an electrical device. One day after rounds, my secretary said the husband and son of the patient wanted to see me. They told me their wife and mother was obviously going to die; she was a nurse and had told her family that she never wanted this kind of terrible death, being maintained by machines. I told them that while I respected their view, there was nothing deadly about her situation. The kidney  failure she had was just the kind for which the artificial kidney was most effective. While possibly a bit reassured, they were disappointed. Here was the head surgeon seemingly determined to keep everybody alive, no matter what.
Within a few days the patient's pacemaker  could be removed and she awoke from her coma. About six months later, the door of my office opened and in walked a gloriously fit woman. After some cheery words of appreciation, the father and son asked to speak to me alone. As soon as the door closed, both men became quite tearful. All that came out was, ""We want you to know how wrong we were.""
The second patient was an 85-year-old lady whose hair caught fire while she was smoking. She arrived with a deep burn; I knew it would surely be deadly. As a remarkable coincidence there was a meeting for discussion going on at the time in medical ethics . The speaker asked me if I had any sort of ethical problem I could bring up for discussion. I described the case and asked the students their opinion. After the discussion, I made a remark that was, when looking back, a serious mistake. I said, ""I'll take the word back to the nurses about her and we will talk about it some more before we decide."" The instructor and the students were shocked: ""You mean this is a real patient?"" The teacher of ethics was not accustomed to being challenged by actuality. In any event, I went back and met with the nurses. A day or two later, when she was making no progress and was suffering terribly, we began to back off treatment. Soon she died quietly and not in pain. As a reasonable physician, you had better move ahead and do what you would want done for you. And don't discuss it with the world first. There is a lesson here for everybody. Assisting people to leave this life requires strong judgment and long experience to avoid its misuse. 
 Question:The author suggested that doctors  _   before they assist a patient in killing himself. 
A. do what they are wanted to do 
B. discuss with the others about the decision first 
C. be required to do so first by the patient 
D. make sure there is no other choice left 
 Answer: D
Context: Each year millions of babies are born too soon and too small. Premature or preterm births are defined as births at less than thirty-seven weeks.
    Prematurity is the leading cause of death in newborn babies. More than one-fourth of the four million newborns who die each year around the world were born too early.
    Preterm babies that survive can suffer a lifetime of serious health conditions. The examples include cerebral palsy, blindness, hearing problems and learning disabilities. Families and communities face emotional, physical and financial costs.
    Christopher Howson is the vice president for global programs at the March of Dimes, a nonprofit group. His group and the World Health Organization recently published a report called ""The Global and Regional Toll of Preterm Birth."" 
    CHRISTOPHER HOWSON: ""Frankly the crisis of preterm birth is under-recognized, undercounted, undervalued and under-funded. I mean, this report shows that thirteen million babies are born every year preterm, and that over a million of those babies die as a result of being born too early."" 
    And these are just estimates; the true numbers could be even higher. More than eighty-five percent of preterm births happen in Africa and Asia. Africa has the highest rate, with about four million cases each year.
    Chris Howson says many of the causes of preterm births are related to poverty and weak health-care systems.
    CHRISTOPHER HOWSON: ""For example, the poor overall health and nutritional status of women. A high burden of infectious diseases. Lack of provision of family planning - allowing a woman to decide when to start and end having children and how to space her children. And also the lack of good prenatal care programs that might identify problems early on in pregnancy."" 
Preterm births are a problem not just in the developing world. The combined rate in the United States and Canada is the second highest in the world. Preterm birth rates in the United States have increased thirty-six percent in the last twenty-five years.
    This has been largely the result of two reasons. One is an increase in pregnancies among women over age thirty-five. The other is an increase in the use of reproductive therapies.

A. Chris Howson, an Excellent Vice President 
B. Preterm Births 
C. ""The Global and Regional Toll of Preterm Birth"" 
D. Emotional, Physical and Financial Costs

Context: A mom in Australia was told by a doctor that her newborn son was ""dead"",but she helped bring him back to life  by holding the baby against her body. She used a method known as ""kangaroo care "".The child,named Jamie,was born after only 27 weeks with his twin sister,Emily,at a hospital in Sydney.Her birth went well,but his was a different story.The doctor struggled for 20 minutes to save him before declaring him dead.
""His little arms and legs were just falling down away from his body,"" Kate Ogg said.""I took my coat off and put him on my chest with his head over my arm."" She and her husband,David,spoke to the child as she continued to hold him for nearly two hours.During that time,the twopound baby showed signs of life.She said,""I told my mom,who was there,that he was still alive.Then he held out his hand and grabbed my finger.""
The doctor at first ignored the baby's movements,but when he put the stethoscope   to its chest,his mouth fell wide open and he said,""It's my fault.It's a miracle  .""
""The care helps the baby keep body warmth,"" Dr Pinchi Srinivasan said.""It also regulates   heart and breathing rates and is believed to help weight gain and improve sleeping habits.Fathers can also use 'kangaroo care'.The key to the method is skintoskin contact."" 
The practice began in less developed nations.It has become a recognized practice in helping premature _ babies.The technique is good for babies,and is used in many baby care units. 
 Question:When the baby first showed signs of life,the doctor  _  . 
A. didn't believe a miracle  had happened 
B. was too shocked to do anything 
C. was cheered and tried to save the baby at once 
D. was moved by what the mother did to the baby 
 Answer: A
Context: Pregnancy  and childbirth kill more than 536,000 women a year. More than half of the cases happened in Africa, according to the World Health Organization. In fact, most of the deaths are preventable with basic medical care.
The five leading causes are bleeding, infection, high blood pressure, longtime labor and bad abortions  . Mothers' deaths from such causes were largely reduced nearly a century ago in developed countries.
Experts say that what kill many women are ""the three delays""-- the woman's delay in deciding to go to the hospital, the time she loses traveling there and the hospital's delay in starting treatment. Only about 15 percent of births have dangerous complications .
Women lack education and information about birth control. Husbands and inlaws, may decide where a woman gives birth and insist that she stay at home to save money. However, there is no single solution to a problem with so many factors--shortages of doctors, nurses, drugs, equipment, roads and transportation--though hospital officials are trying many things now.
One  _ measure to solve the problem for the present has been to train assistant medical officers, to perform certain operations. Some African countries are now struggling to train more assistants and midwives   , and provide places for pregnant women to stay near hospitals.
But there is a long way to go. Only 20 percent of women in the continent give birth at the hospital. More than 50 percent stay at home to give birth, and the rest go to local clinics that cannot handle emergencies. 
 Question:Which is not included in the five leading causes of women's deaths during pregnancy and childbirth? 
A. Infection. 
B. High blood pressure. 
C. Traveling long distances. 
D. Bleeding.

Context: Up to 90% of school leavers in major Asian cities are suffering from myopia ---short-sightedness, a study suggests. Researchers say the ""extraordinary rise"" in the problem is being caused by students working very hard in school and missing out on outdoor light.
Eye experts say that you are short-sighted if your vision is blurred  beyond 2m. It is often caused by an elongation  of the eyeball that happens when people are young. According to the research, the problem is being caused by a combination of factors - a commitment to education and lack of outdoor light.
Professor Morgan who led this study argues that many children in South East Asia spend long hours studying at school and doing their homework. This in itself puts pressure on the eyes, but exposure to between two and three hours of daylight helps maintain healthy eyes.
Cultural factors also seem to play a part. Across many parts of South East Asia, children often have a lunchtime nap. According to Professor Morgan they are missing out on natural light to prevent short-sightedness.
A big concern is the numbers of the students suffering from ""high"" myopia. One in five of these students could experience severe visual impairment  and even blindness. These people are at considerable risk--sometimes people are not told about it and are just given more powerful glasses--they need to be warned about the risk and given some self-testing measures so they can get to an ophthalmologist and get some help.
For decades, researchers believed there was a strong genetic component to the condition. But this study strongly suggests an alternative view. ""Any type of simple genetic explanation just doesn't fit with that speed of change; gene pools just don't change in two generations. Whether it's a purely environmental effect or an environmental effect playing a sensitive genome, it really doesn't matter, the thing that's changed is not the gene pool---it's the environment."" 
 Question:Which of the following statements do you think agrees with Professor Morgan? 
A. A lunchtime nap is helpful in reducing myopia. 
B. Glasses keep myopia from getting even worse. 
C. It's necessary to treat myopia with an operation. 
D. It's of vital importance to reduce educational pressure. 
 Answer: D
Context: When a first-time father saw his newborn son, he immediately noticed the baby's ears obviously standing out from his head. He expressed his concern to the nurse that some children might be made fun of his child. A doctor examined the baby and reassured the new dad that his son was healthy---- the ears presented only a small problem with its appearance.
But the nervous father continued. He wondered if the child might suffer psychological effects of ridicule, or if they should consider plastic surgery . The nurse assured him that it was really no problem, and he should just wait to see if the boy grows into his ears.
The father finally felt more optimistic about his child, but now he worried about his wife's reaction to those large ears. She had been delivered by operation, and had not yet seen the child.
""She doesn't take things as easily as I do,"" he said to the nurse.
By this time, the new mother was settled in the recovery room and ready to meet her new baby. The nurse went along with the dad to lend some support in case this inexperienced mother became upset about her baby's large ears.
The baby was in a blanket  with his head covered for the short trip through the cold air-conditioned corridor. The baby was placed in his mother's arms, who eased the blanket back so that she could look at her child for the first time.
She took one look at her baby's face and looked to her husband and gasped, ""Oh, Honey! Look! He has your ears!""
No problem with Mom. She married those ears...and she loves the man to whom _ are attached.
The poet Kahlil Gibran said, ""Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart."" It's hard to see the ears when you're looking into the light. 
 Question:What is true about the baby's mother? 
A. She blamed her husband for the baby's big ears. 
B. She was the first to discover the baby's large ears. 
C. She suggested having an operation on the baby immediately. 
D. She found something similar between the baby and its father. 
 Answer: D
Context: French surgeons have performed what they said on Wednesday was the world's first partial face transplant--- giving a new nose, chin and lips to a woman attacked by a dog.
Specialists from two French hospitals carried out the operation on a 38-year-old woman on Sunday in the northern city of Amiens by taking the face from a brain-dead woman, who had hanged herself just hours before the operation. Her family agreed on the operation.
""The patient is in an excellent state and the transplant looks normal,"" the hospitals said in a brief statement after waiting three days to announce the pioneering surgery.
The woman had been left without a nose and lips after the dog attacked her last May, and was unable to talk or chew properly. Such injuries are ""extremely difficult, if not impossible"" to repair using normal surgical techniques, the statement said.
The statement did not say what the woman would look like when she had fully recovered, but medical experts said she was unlikely to _ the woman who had been the source of her new face.
The operation was led by Jean-Michel Dubernard, a specialist from a hospital in Lyon who has also carried out hand transplants,
Skin transplants have long been used to treat burns and other injuries, but operations around the mouth and nose have been considered very difficult because of the area's high sensitivity to foreign tissue.
Teams in France, the United States and Britain had been developing techniques to make face transplants a reality
There was a short-term risk for the patient if blood vessels became blocked, a medium-term danger of her body rejecting the new skin and a long-term possibility that the drugs used could cause cancers.
Experts say that although such medical advances should be celebrated, the transplant had thrown up moral and ethical issues. Little is known about the psychological effect of the transplant. 
 Question:The best title for the passage would be   _  . 
A. French Woman has First Partial Face Transplant 
B. First Face Transplant Opens Debate 
C. Risks and Ethical Problems of a Face Transplant 
D. A Complete Face Transplant of a French Woman

Context: ""Fingers were made before forks."" When a person gives up good manners, put aside knife and fork, and dives into his food, someone is likely to repeat that saying.
The fork was an ancient agricultural tool, but for centuries no one thought of eating with it. Not until the eleventh century, when a young lady from Constantinople brought her fork to Italy, did the custom reach Europe.
By the fifteenth century the use of the fork was wide-spread in Italy. The English explanation was that Italians were unwilling to eat food touched with fingers, ""seeing all men's fingers are not alike clean.
Anyone who used a fork to eat with was laughed at in England for the next hundred years. Not until the late 1600's did using a fork become a common custom.

Context: Lee's mother Sun became unexpectedly pregnant while married to a disabled man. Doctors told her that because of a medication she had been taking her child would not be normal. She chose to continue with the pregnancy and in 1985 in Seoul, South Korea, little Hee Ah Lee was born with only two fingers on each hand, disfigurement of her legs, and slight brain injury. The hospital told Sun that she could not care for the child at home and her relatives wanted her to place the child for adoption in a foreign country. Sun, however, thought her baby would live a successful life.
When Lee was a pre-schooler, Sun wanted her daughter to take piano lessons for two reasons. One was that she felt it would help her strengthen her hands so she could hold a pencil. The other was that she felt that if she could master the piano, she could master anything. For six months piano schools turned them down and then the one teacher who did accept the task got discouraged and wanted to quit. It was a three-month contest of wills between mother and daughter that led to a conflict in which Sun actually threw her daughter on the floor in frustration. But Lee got back up on the piano bench and for the first time played a children's song. That was the turning point and one year later Lee won the grand prize in a piano concert for Kindergartners. It was at the age of 7 that Lee won Korea's 19th National Handicap Conquest Contest and was presented with her award by the President of Korea.
Lee has won numerous awards, and is a widely traveled concert pianist with more than 200 appearances. Her first album titled ""Hee-ah, a Pianist with Four Fingers"" was released in June, 2008.
Lee speaks highly of her mother for challenging her to master the piano and said that although her training was difficult, ""As time went by, the piano became my source of inspiration and my best friend."" 
 Question:When was Lee awarded by the president of Korea? 
A. 1985

Context: Every year, World Blood Day is celebrated by blood services worldwide on 14 June, the birthday of Nobel Prize winner Karl Landsteiner, the man who discovered the ABO blood group system. If you have every thought of becoming a blood donor, just register to do it. And you should never worry about the donation.
Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body.
It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients.
First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday.
Although most people are able to give blood, some people who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease are no tasked to be donors. Pregnant women or those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood.
Blood has a very short shelf life. Some blood components can be kept longer than others, for instance red blood cells will keep for 35 days but platelets for only five. Remember, you should wait at least 16 weeks before donating blood again. 
 Question:What component of blood is used to treat burned patients? 
A. Plasma 
B. Red blood cell

Context: Why is 2004 a special year? Because it is a Leap Year  .
What's so special about that? Well, we have a Leap Year every four years. And it has 366 days, not the usual   365. In a Leap Year, we have 29 days in February, while in a usual year we have only 28 days.
Why do we have a Leap Year? We have a Leap Year so we can keep the calendar   in step with the seasons. The calendar is a kind of clock for the year. But how long is a year? A calendar year is 365 days. But a true year is 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 46 seconds long. That's the time it takes the earth to go around the sun. So every four years we have one more day, and we put it at the end of February, the shortest month of a year. Then we have a Leap Year.

Context: More than four decades ago British scientist Robert Edwards first witnessed the miracle of human life growing inside a test tube at his Cambridge lab. Since that ground-breaking moment, more than four million babies have been born through IVF and in 2010 his great contribution to science was finally recognized as he was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine.
The prize for Dr Edwards, who was given a Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Award in 2008, includes a PS900,000 cheque. The Nobel Assembly described IVF as a ""milestone in modern medicine"".
With the help of fellow scientist Patrick Steptoe, the Manchester-born physiologist developed IVF -- leading to the birth of the world's first test tube baby. Dr Steptoe died 10 years later but their work has transformed fertility treatment and given hope to millions of couples.
It was a scientific breakthrough that transformed the lives of millions of couples. They said: ""His achievements have made it possible to treat infertility, a disease which makes human unable to have a baby. This condition has been afflicting a large percentage of mankind including more than 10% of all couples worldwide.""
Louise Brown, the world's first test tube baby, made international headlines when she was born in Oldham, Gtr Manchester, in 1978 to parents Lesley and John who had been fruitlessly trying for a baby since 1969.
Ivf-in-vitro fertilisation is the process whereby egg cells are fertilised outside the body before being implanted in the womb. After a cycle of IVF, the probability of a couple with infertility problems having a baby is one in five -- the same as healthy couples who conceive naturally.
Professor Edwards, who has five daughters and 11 grandchildren, began his research at Cambridge University in 1963, after receiving his PhD in 1955.He once said: ""The most important thing in life is having a child. Nothing is more special than a child."" With the help of fellow scientist Patrick Steptoe, Prof. Edwards founded the Bourn Hall clinic in Cambridge shire, which now treats more than 900 women a year. Each year, more than 30,000 women in Britain now undergo IVF and 11,000 babies are born as a result of the treatment.
But his work attracted widespread criticism from some scientists and the Catholic Church who said it was ""unethical and immoral"".
Martin Johnson, professor of reproductive  sciences at the University of Cambridge, said the award was ""long overdue"". He said: ""We couldn't understand why the Nobel has come so late but he is delighted -- this is the cherry on the cake for him.""
Professor Edwards was too ill to give interviews but a statement released by his family said he was ""thrilled and delighted"". 
 Question:Why did Professor Edwards begin his research on tube baby? 
A. Because he thought it of great significance to have a child in life. 
B. Because the birthrate around the world was unexpectedly low then. 
C. Because a special child did make a difference to an ordinary family. 
D. Because his fellow scientist wanted to give hope to the unlucky couples.

Context: Paper was first made in the year 105. It was made by a Chinese named Cai Lun.
People in Japan learned of paper around the year 600. As years went by, people in other places began to make paper.
The lead  pencil is not made of lead. It is made of graphite . People found graphite in 1564. They thought it was a kind of lead. Today we still call pencils ""lead pencils"". The first pencils were made by putting strings  around sticks of graphite.
The first wooden pencils were made by Kasper Faber from Germany in 1761.
Erasers like those we use today were first made in France by a man named Magellan in 1752. It was Hyman L. Lipman who first put eraser on the ends of pencils. And that is how the pencils come to be. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is NOT true? 
A. Paper was first made in China. 
B. Graphite isn't a kind of lead. 
C. The first wooden pencils were made in Germany. 
D. Hyman L. Lipman made the first erasers. 
 Answer: D
Context: Most people know precious gemstones   by their appearances. An emerald flashes deep green, a ruby seems to hold a red fire inside, and a diamond shines like a star. It's more difficult to tell where the gem was mined, since a diamond from Australia or Arkansas may appear the same to one from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, recently, a team of scientists has found a way to identify a gemstone's origin.
Beneath the surface of a gemstone, on the tiny level of atoms and molecules , lie clues   to its origin. At this year's meeting of the Geological Society of America in Minneapolis, Catherine McManus reported on a technique that uses lasers   to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland. McManus directs scientific research at Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas. The company is developing the technique. ""With enough data, we could identify which country, which mining place, even the individual mine a gemstone comes from,"" McManus told Science News.
Some gemstones, including many diamonds, come from war-torn countries. Sales of those ""blood minerals"" may encourage violent civil wars where innocent people are injured or killed. In an effort to reduce the trade in blood minerals, the U.S. government passed law in July 2010 that requires companies that sell gemstones to determine the origins of their stones.
To figure out where gemstones come from, McManus and her team focus a powerful laser on a small sample of the gemstone. The technique is called laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. Just as heat can turn ice into water or water into steam, energy from the laser changes the state of matter of the stone. The laser changes a miniscule part of the gemstone into plasma, a gas state of matter in which tiny particles called electrons separate from atoms.
The plasma, which is superhot, produces a light pattern. (The science of analyzing this kind of light pattern is called spectroscopy.) Different elements produce different patterns, but McManus and her team say that gemstones from the same area produce similar patterns. Materialytics has already collected patterns from thousands of gemstones, including more than 200 from diamonds. They can compare the light pattern from an unknown gemstone to patterns they do know and look for a match. The light pattern acts like a signature, telling the researchers the origin of the gemstone.
In a small test, the laser technique correctly identified the origins of 95 out of every 100 diamonds. For gemstones like emeralds and rubies, the technique proved successful for 98 out of every 100 stones. The scientists need to collect and analyze more samples, including those from war-torn countries, before the tool is ready for commercial use.
Scientists like Barbara Dutrow, a mineralogist from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, find the technique exciting. ""This is a basic new tool that could provide a better fingerprint of a material from a particular locality,"" she told Science News. 
 Question:The author wrote this passage mainly to   _  . 
A. tell us how to identify the origin of diamonds. 
B. introduce a laser technique in identifying a stone's origin 
C. prove identifying the origin of gemstones are difficult 
D. attract our attention to reducing trade in blood minerals 
 Answer: B
Context: Joker found one of the biggest diamonds in the world right in his own back yard. He sold the stone to a diamond dealer for over three hundred thousand dollars. In New York, the diamond was resold---this time for almost eight hundred thousand dollars. The true value of a diamond is never known until it has been cut. Once cut successfully, its value can increase a thousand times. It's easy to understand why the owner of Joker's diamond went to the best diamond cutter he knew, Kaplan. The cutter studied the diamond for twelve whole months.
When he felt he was ready to start work, he discovered a flaw   . He had to begin his calculations all over again, or he might have made the stone useless. Six months passed, and Kaplan finally said to the owner, ""I am ready to start my work. There will be one excellent diamond that will be comparable one excellent diamond of first-class quality    "" Kaplan waited a few more days until he felt he was in the best physical and mental   condition  possible. He picked up his tools   and held his breath as he made the diamond exactly as he promised. 
 Question:When the diamond was resold,   _   . 
A. the dealer lost a lot of money 
B. Joker made some more money 
C. the dealer got 800, 000 dollars 
D. Kaplan got 800,000 dollars

Context: In some parts of the United States, farming is easy. But farming has always been difficult in the northeastern corner of the country, which is called New England.
    New England has many trees and thin, rocky soil. Anyone who has wanted to start a new farm there has had to work very hard. The first job has been cutting down trees. The next job has been digging the stumps of the trees out of the soil. Then the farmer has had the difficult job of removing stones from his land.
    This work of removing stones never really ends, because every winter more stones appear. They come up through the thin soil from the rocks below. Farmers have to keep removing stones from the fields. Even today, farms which have been worked on for 200 years keep producing more stones.
    That is why stone walls are used instead of fences around New England fields. The stone walls are not high; a man can easily climb over them. But they keep the farmer's cows from joining his neighbor's cows. 
 Question:In New England, stone walls are used   _  . 
A. to protect the farmer's fields from thieves 
B. to keep the farmer's cattle from wandering away 
C. to provide privacy for the farmer's family 
D. to prevent the wind from blowing away the earth

Context: Chemicals used for industrial processes often create dangerous forms of waste. The amount of these chemicals has risen heavily in the past few years, as more areas of the world industrialize and new products are produced. Over 80,000 different chemicals are used in industries world wide. Around the world hundreds of millions of tons of harmful waste are produced each year. Often, it is difficult and expensive to get rid of these chemicals or to store them in a way that does not endanger human life and the environment.
     Every year, major health problems result from harmful waste. Sadly, it is often when someone has died or, become seriously ill that governments will take action and reduce levels of dumped harmful waste. In 1989, a school inprefix = st1 /New Jerseyhad to be closed because students there had suffered too much exposure to chromium. It was later learned that large amounts of chromium had been dumped nearby and blown over to the school area.
     Research has been done to provide information on the effects of every chemical. Because waste chemicals often mix together, it will also be necessary to learn how the combinations of these chemicals affect human health.
   Some governments have realized how serous the problem is and are making laws to get rid of harmful waste. They are also trying to limit the amount of waste industries are allowed to produce.
   Not only governments but the public as well must form part of the solution. They can choose not to buy those products which require the production of harmful waste, attempt to affect policymakers, and produce less harmful waste themselves. Many scientists think that waste production can be cut. The waste can be reduced by at least one-third using existing technologies and methods. 
 Question:From the text we know that   _  . 
A. chromium can poison people when there is a wind 
B. chromium pollution makes the local government close the school 
C. Some governments don't realize how serious the problems are until people suffer a lot from harmful waste 
D. about two-thirds of the waste can pollute the environment 
 Answer: C
Context: Medical drugs sometimes cause more damage than they cure. One solution to this problem is to put the drugs inside a capsule, protecting them from the body--and the body from them--until they can be released at just the right spot. There are lots of ways to trigger   this release, including changing temperature, acidity, and so on. But triggers can come with their own risks--burns, for example. Now, researchers in California have designed what could be a harmless trigger to date: shining near-infrared light (NIR, ) on the drug in the capsule.
The idea of using light to liberate the drug in the capsule isn't new. Researchers around the globe have developed polymers   and other materials that begin to break down when they absorb either ultraviolet (UV, ) or visible light. But tissues also readily absorb UV and visible light, which means the drug release can be triggered only near the skin, where the light can reach the capsule. NIR light largely passes through tissues, so researchers have tried to use it as a trigger. But few compounds   absorb NIR well and go through chemical changes.
That changed last year when Adah Almutairi, a chemist at the University of California, San Diego, reported that she and her colleagues had designed a polymer that breaks down when it absorbs NIR light. Their polymer used a commercially available NIR-absorbing group called o-nitrobenzyl (ONB). When they catch the light, ONB groups fall off the polymer, leading to its breakdown. But ONB is only a so-so NIR absorber, and it could be poisonous to cells when it separates from the polymer.
So Almutairi and her colleagues reported creating a new material for capsules that's even better.This one consists of a long chain of compounds called cresol groups linked in a polymer. Cresol contains reactive  components that make it highly unstable in its polymeric form, a feature Almutairi and her colleagues use to their advantage. After polymerizing the cresols, they cap each reactive component with a light-absorbing compound called Bhc. When the Bhcs absorb NIR light, the reactive groups are exposed and break the long polymer into two short chains. Shining additional light continues this breakdown, potentially releasing any drugs in the capsule. What's more, Almutairi says, Bhc is 10 times better at absorbing NIR than is ONB and is not poisonous to cells. 
 Question:Which word can be used to complete the following process of changes? 
A. protected 
B. formed 
C. exposed 
D. combined

Context: Code Offence Points
What is Driving _ Points System?
After the introduction of this system, certain traffic offences will make the driver lose points besides other punishments  . A driver makes any of these offences, the points will be recorded.When the driver gets a certain number of points, he will be forbidden   to drive for a certain amount of time.
what are the purposes of this system?
This is a system designed to make road much safer. It can improve standards   of driving and reduce accidents.
Which traffic offences will result in Driving Offence Points?
Of course, not all traffic offences are covered by this system. Only those that have direct effect on road safety are included.There are fourteen items in all.
1 Causing death by dangerous driving 10
2 Dangerous driving 10
3 Careless driving 5
4 Driving after drinking or taking drugs 10
5 Driving over speed limit by more than15 km/hour 3

11 Crossing double white lines 3
12 Failing to obey traffic signals 3
13 Failing to give way to walkers at a crosswalk. Failing to stop for people walking 3
14 Failing to stop at school crossing 3
What will happen if you have got up to 10 points?
If you have got 10 points or above, but still less than 15 points, you will receive a warning letter from the Transport Department. This letter will tell your record of Driving Offence Points and remind you of the result of getting more points. It is hoped that this warning will change your driving behavior for the better.
What will happen if you have got 15 points?
If you have got 15 points or more within two years, a court will take away your driving license. The first time you are found guilty you will not be able to drive for three months, but if you are caught a second time you will not be able to drive for six months.

Context: After years of hearing drivers complain about scratches on their cars, Japan's Nissan Motor Company has officially announced the next big thing---a paint that not only resists scratches and scrapes, but actually repairs itself within a few days.
The new material, developed by Nippon Paint Company, contains an elastic rubbery-like resin  that is able to heal minor marks caused by car wash equipment, parking lot encounters, road debris   or even on-purpose destruction. The automaker admits its results vary depending on the temperature and the depth of the damage, but adds this is the only paint like it in the world, and tests prove it works. Minor scratches, the most common type, are said to slowly fade over about a week. And once they're gone, there is no trace that they were ever there. The special paint is said to last for at least three years after it is first applied, but there is no word yet on whether more can be added after that period.
Nissan claims car washes are the worst offenders for this type of damage, accounting for at least 80 percent of all incidents. But the complete auto-healing won't come without scratching your wallet. The vehicle maker notes the special paint adds about $ 100 U.S. to the price of a car. It plans to use its new chemical mixture only on its X - Trail SUVs in Japan for now, as it looks for a more widespread presentation. And while plans to offer the feature overseas haven't been made yet, if it's a hit there, you can be almost sure market forces will drive it to these shores, as well. 
 Question:The paint used on cars can  _  . 
A. last 3 years before it is re-applied again 
B. fade only in a few days 
C. help to protect cars from minor paint damage 
D. reduce car scrape incidents to 20 percent 
 Answer: C
Context: In a unique research cooperation between Stratasys, Education, R&D departments and MIT's Self-Assembly Lab, a new process is being developed, known as 4D Printing.
The 4D printing concept, which allows materials to ""self-assemble  "" into 3D structures, was initially proposed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty member Skylar Tibbits. Tibbits and his team combined a strand   of plastic with a layer made out of ""smart"" material that could self-assemble in water. They advanced this concept by creating materials that can change into several different complicated shapes, though this kind of material remains the bottleneck of 4D technology.
To many people that are just starting to get used to the idea of 3D printers, the name 4D is causing confusion because they cannot understand where this fourth ""dimension"" coming from. 4D technology shares many of the same principles of 3D printing and is essentially still about creating a new, 3D structure out of certain component; however, Tibbits states the fourth dimension at work here comes from concept of the fourth dimension of time. The difference between these 3D and 4D creations is that these new forms have the ability to transform and adapt over time.
4D printing works through self-assembly -- a system where ""disordered elements form an ""ordered"" structure via an interaction. With these 4D printed materials, these disordered materials are strands or sheets of specially designed materials. Environmental changes then stimulate  a response from them so that they form a preprogrammed shape.
The idea of having adaptable technology that only relies on energy and non-human interactions raises some interesting questions about where 4D printing can be used and the practical applications in dangerous environments. This could mean improved infrastructures in extreme conditions, leading to a reduced need for workers to put themselves at risk, but the potential goes even further than that. The technology promises exciting new possibilities for a variety of applications. A solar panel or similar product could be produced in a flat shape onto which functional devices can be easily installed. It could then be changed to a compact shape for packing and shipping. After arriving at its destination, the product could be stimulated to form a different shape that serves its function. Also it could be used to build furniture, bikes, cars and even buildings. As with many of the ideas being put forward, it is easy to go a step too far into the extreme, but this just shows the potential of 4D in comparison to 3D.
The next stage for the research is to move from printing single strands to sheets and eventually whole structures. And water need not be the process ' s only energy source. 
 Question:The major problem concerning the development of 4D printing lies in   _  .

Context: A new study shows that fat people in the United States suffer direct economic and social effects because of their size. The findings are from an 8-year study of about 100,000 people. The people who were studied were between the age of 18 and 24 when the research began.
The researchers who carried out the study say they consider the people fat if they are in the top of 5% of the measurement in which weight is linked to height. For example, fat women in the study were about 160 centimeters tall and weighed about 90 kilograms. Fat men in the study were about 175 centimeters tall and weighed 100 kilograms. The researchers say that more than 1,000,000 Americans are that big. The researchers found that fat young women were from wealthy families. The fat women also were 20% less likely to get married and they earned an average of about $6,700 a year less than other women. The study showed less
effects on fat men. They earned an average of about $3,000 a year less than other men. Fat men also were 11% less likely to get married. 
 Question:The passage mainly tells us    _   . 
A. the standards of fat people 
B. the number of fat Americans 
C. fat people have fewer advantages 
D. how long is the study 
 Answer: C
Context: A new study shows one of the largest glaciers  in Greenland is becoming smaller and speeding to the sea faster than scientists expected. If it continues, Greenland itself could become much smaller during this century and global seas could rise as much as 3 feet.
The rates of change that we're noticing are much higher than expected. If these rates continue, it is not likely that Greenland could shrink by several tens of percent this century. However, it's not known how quickly this coastal response of the Greenland ice sheet melting will have an effect on the vast inland ice.
Greenland is the world's largest island, covering area more than three times the size of Texas. Some 81 percent of it is covered by ice, and there are many glaciers. Glaciers are like slow-moving rivers of ice. Where a glacier meets the sea, its weight keeps it firmly resting on the bottom. A glacier's front is the point where the water is deep enough that the glacier floats.
Since the 1970s, the front of Helheim stayed in the same place. Then it began melting rapidly, moving back 4.5 miles from 2001 through this past summer. It has also grown thinner, from top to bottom, by more than 130 feet since 2001. And over these past years, its trip to the sea has sped up from about 70 feet per day to nearly 110.
The melting is driven by a warmer climate. Temperatures in Greenland have risen more than five degrees Fahrenheit  in the last ten years. Since most of Greenland's ice is on land, seas will rise as the ice melts. If all Greenland's ice sheet melted, oceans would be 15-20 feet higher. Nobody expects that to happen any time soon. 
 Question:According to the passage, we know that Greenland    _   . 
A. belongs to Canada 
B. is the largest island in North America 
C. is all covered with glaciers 
D. is sinking under the sea level

Context: On November18, 1995, Itzhak Perlman, the world famous violinist, came on stage to give a concert at Lincoln Centre in New York City. If you have ever been to a Perlman concert, you know that getting on stage is not easy for him. He got polio as a child, and has to walk with the aid of two crutches now.
That night Perlman walked slowly to his chair. Then he sat down and began to play. But, suddenly, one of the strings on his violin broke. You could hear it break---it broke with a loud noise.
People thought to themselves, ""He would have to get up to either find another violin or find another string for this one.""
But he didn't. Instead, he waited a moment, closed his eyes and then signaled the conductor to begin again. The orchestra began, and he played from where he had stopped. He played with such passion and such power.
Of course, everyone knows that it is impossible to play a symphonic work with just three strings. But that night Itzhak Perlman refused to know that. You could see him changing and recomposing the piece in his head.
When he finished, there was a silence in the room. Then people rose and cheered. We were all on our feet, doing everything we could to show how much we appreciated what he had done.
He smiled and then he said in a quiet tone, ""You know, sometimes it is the artist's task to find out how much music you can make with what you have left.""
His words have stayed in my mind ever since I heard them. That is also the way of life. Perhaps our task in this quickly changing world in which we live is to make music, at first with all that we have, and then, when that is no longer possible, to make music with what we have left. 
 Question:The audience rose and cheered   _  . 
A. to show they are satisfied with Perlman's performance 
B. to thank the orchestra for their passionate performance 
C. to ask Perlman for another performance 
D. to express their appreciation of Perlman's creative mind

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. ""

Context: I feel it enormous responsibility, as a mother of two little girls, to lead you down a path that is relatively healthy when it comes to beauty and self-image.
In a lot of women's eyes I've probably already failed in that respect due to the amount of pink princess Barbie   mess cluttering up   Vera's room. But I will say something about Barbie: I played with that stuff for a solid decade when I was growing up and here I am now at a healthy weight with a healthy outlook on my body and image. I have a successful career. If Barbie was really so damaging to my femininity   and self-image I highly doubt I could list all of the accomplishments.
But I get it too. It's hard for women to maintain a healthy self-image. I have girlfriends around whom I have to brace myself to see, because just being around them makes me self-conscious. I look at old pictures of my mother and wonder why I've never been able to be as skinny as she was. And then I have friends who are thinner than their mothers ever were. We women go round and round in circles, holding hands and trying to be one another sometimes. Men like to think we dress and style ourselves for them, but why would we when they hardly notice? I've never tried so hard to look good when I know I'm about to meet up with a stylish girlfriend. It's she who will notice my slimmed-down waist or the thinnest, little bracelet on my arm.
And I have no doubt that the two of you, Veronica and Juliette, will endlessly compare yourselves to each other. You will wonder why one of you got longer legs or shinier hair. The thing I'll tell you is this: not even the prettiest of us feel settled. The girl you think looks the most perfect in the world is probably the girl who wants to change herself more than anyone else.
Don't take these on. You are not worthless. You are so full of love and light and you should let it shine through your every second. If someone pushes you down for standing tall then just push yourself back up and stand even taller. And know that the reason they push you down in the first place is just because they're scared. 
 Question:The author advises her daughters that   _  . 
A. they should be cautious not to be pushed down by others 
B. they should care much about their strong points instead of appearances 
C. they should try to grow taller than others 
D. they should care more about others' opinions

The horses were no bigger than the cats.These small horses lived in the forest. The toes helped the horses run on the soft, wet ground.
At first, it was very hot in the forest. But the weather changed. It became very cold. Many trees could not live in cold weather. The trees died and fell. Open fields took the place of forests. The sun made the ground dry and hard.

Context: Every year, World Blood Day is celebrated by blood services worldwide on 14 June, the birthday of Nobel Prize winner Karl Landsteiner, the man who discovered the ABO blood group system. If you have every thought of becoming a blood donor, just register to do it. And you should never worry about the donation.
Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body.
It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients.
First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday.
Although most people are able to give blood, some people who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease are no tasked to be donors. Pregnant women or those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood.
Blood has a very short shelf life. Some blood components can be kept longer than others, for instance red blood cells will keep for 35 days but platelets for only five. Remember, you should wait at least 16 weeks before donating blood again. 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that  _  . 
A. whole blood is most widely used in hospital 
B. platelets can be kept for more than 10 days 
C. people can donate their blood four times a years

Context: Many psychologists in the early twentieth century believed that humans use only 10 percent of their brains, and even the great Albert Einstein once wrote that most people use only a small portion of the grey matter between their ears. It's a theory that has often been put forward in television documentaries; magazines, advertisements and books over the past century.
But nearly all scientists now agree the 10 percent theory is completely
. In fact, they question how this figure was ever arrived at in the first place and what areas of the brain are supposed to be unneeded. The theory supposes that if 90 percent of the brain were removed, a person would Still be able to function normally, while in reality it is known that damage to even a small area of the brain can result in extremely serious physical injury different activities and that many areas of the brain are used at the same time for some complex activities or thought processes.
Throughout the course of one day, most .areas of the brain are active at some time, even during sleep. The 10 percent theory suggests that certain areas o' the brain are not used, but scans slow activities throughout the entire brain and not in any separate part. The final argument against the 10 percent theory is the fact that doctors carefully map the brain before removing brain cancers so that they don't affect other essential areas.
From an evolutionary point of view, it's highly unlikely butt our comparatively larger brains would have evolved from our ancestors if the extra areas were not needed. In fact, there is absolutely no evidence support the 10 percent theory. 
 Question:Which of the following is true according to the writer? 
A. We use less than 10% of our brains. 
B. Most brain disorders affect the same part of the brain. 
C. The brain is less active during times of sleep. 
D. The 10 percent theory does not make evolutionary sense.

Context: If you were asked what your body is made of, probably you would say that it is made of flesh  and bones and covered with skin. You also know something about the blood which flows through it, and that there is a very important part which we call the brain.
But the flesh and the bones make up the largest part of the body, and there is a good deal to be learned about them. You know the general appearance of both flesh and bone from the parts of animals which you see in the butcher's shop.
Bone is hard, and of a white color; indeed, it looks more like a piece of wood or stone than a part of a living animal. But bone is a real part of the living body, and it grows and is nourished  just as the body is. If a man breaks the bone of his arm or his leg, it is firmly bound up, to prevent the broken parts from moving out of the proper places, and in time then bone grows together again and becomes quite strong.
The bones are fastened together by various kinds of joints . They form the framework of the body, and give it strength to retain its proper shape. This framework is called the skeleton . Some animals, such as worms and slugs, have no skeleton; and others, such as shellfish, have a kind of hard covering or skeleton outside.
The most important part of the skeleton is the backbone. It is so important that naturalists divide all animals into two classes,--- those which have a backbone and those which have none. All the higher animals, including man, have a backbone, or vertebral column as it is called. They are therefore called vertebrate  animals. The others are called invertebrate animals. 
 Question:From the passage, we know higher animals are called  _  . 
A. backbone 
B. human beings 
C. vertebrate animals 
D. skeleton 
 Answer: C
Context: For centuries, medical pioneers have refined a variety of methods and medicines to treat sickness, injury, and disability, enabling people to live longer and healthier lives.
""A salamander (a small lizard-like animal) can grow back its leg. Why can't a human do the same?"" asked Peruvian-born surgeon Dr. Anthony Atala in a recent interview. The question, a reference to work aiming to grow new limbs for wounded soldiers, captures the inventive spirit of regenerative medicine. This innovative field seeks to provide patients with replacement body parts.
These parts are not made of steel; they are the real things --- living cells, tissue, and even organs.
Regenerative medicine is still mostly experimental, with clinical applications limited to procedures such as growing sheets of skin on burns and wounds. One of its most significant advances took place in 1999,when a research group at North Carolina's Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine conducted a successful organ replacement with a laboratory-grown bladder. Since then, the team, led by Dr. Atala, has continued to generate a variety of other tissues and organs  from kidneys to ears.
The field of regenerative medicine builds on work conducted in the early twentieth century with the first successful transplants of donated human soft tissue and bone. However, donor organs are not always the best option. First of all, they are in short supply, and many people die while waiting for an available organ; in the United States alone, more than 100,000 people are waiting for organ transplants. Secondly, a patient's body may ultimately reject the transplanted donor organ. An advantage of regenerative medicine is that the tissues are grown from a patient's own cells and will not be rejected by the body's immune system.
Today, several labs are working to create bioartificial body parts. Scientists at Columbia and Yale Universities have grown a jawbone and a lung. At the University of Minnesota, Doris Taylor has created a beating bioartificial rat heart. Dr. Atala's medical team has reported long-term success with bioengineered bladders implanted into young patients with spina bifida (a birth defect that involves the incomplete development of the spinal cord). And at the University of Michigan, H. David Humes has created an artificial kidney.
So far, the kidney procedure has only been used successfully with sheep, but there is hope that one day similar kidney will be implantable in a human patient. The continuing research of scientists such as these may eventually make donor organs unnecessary and, as a result, significantly increase individuals' chances of survival.

Context: One Monday morning, Paul and his classmates were in science laboratory for their practical chemistry lesson. The students were going to work in pairs to do an experiment. Before they began, the teacher gave them this description of the different stages of the experiment.
Stage 1: Prepare the equipment: a test tube, a crucible, a Bunsen burner and tongs.
Stage 2: Weigh 5 grams of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and put it in a crucible.
Stage 3: Heat 10 ml of hydrochloric acid   in a test tube.
Stage 4: Pour the warm acid onto the baking soda and continue to heat the mixture.
Result: The acid reacts with the bicarbonate to form water, carbon dioxide gas and salt. The hotter the mixture, the quicker the reaction. Continue to heat the mixture until the water evaporates, leaving the salt in the crucible.
Paul and his partner followed the instructions and set up their equipment. Paul went to the cupboard to get a bottle of hydrochloric acid. He found that there was only one bottle in the cupboard so he took that. There was no label on the bottle and Paul didn't check with the teacher if it was the right solution.
He measured the liquid and poured it into a test tube. Using tongs to hold the test tube, he heated it over the Bunsen burner. That's when things started to go wrong. The liquid in the test tube was not hydrochloric acid. When it was heated, it formed a thick cloud of white gas. Soon the room was full of this strong smelling white gas.
All the students started coughing and their eyes hurt. The teacher immediately opened the windows and ordered the students to leave the laboratory at once. She realized that the liquid was a crylamide   and that it is poisonous.
Fortunately, nobody was injured in the incident. However, it taught the students and the teacher a good lesson.

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. ""

Context: Here's a story about a very interesting family. A young man once went into town and bought himself a pair of trousers. When he got home, he went upstairs  to his bedroom and put them on. He found that they were about two inches too long.
He came downstairs, where his mother and his two sisters were washing up tea things in the kitchen. ""These new trousers are too long."" He said. "" They need shortening  by about two inches. Would one of you mind doing this for me, please?"" His mother and sisters were busy and they said nothing.
But as soon as his mother had finished washing up, she went quietly upstairs to her son's bedroom and shortened the trousers by two inches. She came downstairs without saying anything to her daughters.
Later on, after supper, the elder sister remembered her brother's trousers. She was a kind-hearted girl, so she went quietly upstairs without saying anything to anyone and shortened the trousers by two inches.
The younger sister went to the cinema, but when she came back, she, too, remembered what her brother had said. So she ran upstairs and took two inches off the legs of the new trousers.

Context: Doctors in hospital emergency rooms often see accidental poisonings . A frightened parent arrives with a child who swallowed a cleaning liquid. Or perhaps the harmful substance is a medicine. Or it might be a chemical product meant to kill insects. These are common causes of accidental poisoning.
In cases like this, look for medical help as soon as possible. Save the container of whatever caused the poisoning. And look on the container for information about anything that stops the effects of the poison. Save anything expelled   from the mouth of the victim. That way, doctors can examine it.
In the past, some people forced poisoning victims to empty the stomach. They used a liquid syrup of ipecac   to do this. But an organization of children's doctors no longer advises parents to keep syrup of ipecac. The American Academy of Pediatrics says some poisons can cause additional damage when they come back up the throat.
Millions of people know a way to save a person who is choking on something trapped in the throat. The method is commonly known as the Heimlich Maneuver or abdominal thrusts. The American Red Cross says a rescuer should first hit the person on the back five times between the shoulder bones. These back blows may ease the choking. If the airway is still blocked, the Red Cross suggests pushing hard five times along the victim's abdomen. The abdomen is the area between the chest and the hip   bones. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the text? 
A. Learning the basics of first aid

Context: Since ancient times, people have known about its ability to reduce pain and high body temperature. More than 2000 years ago, the Greek doctor Hippocrates advised his patients to chew on the bark and leaves of the willow.
The tree contains a chemical called salicin . From salicin, researchers in the 1800s discovered how to make salicylic acid . And in 1897, a chemist named Felix Hoffmann at Friedrich Bayer and Company in Germany created acetyl salicylic acid. Later it became the active substance in a new medicine that Bayer called aspirin. The ""a"" came from acetyl. The ""spir"" came from the spirea plant, which also produces salicin. And the ""in"" Well, that is a common way to end medicine names.
In 1982, a British scientist shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in part for discovering how aspirin works. Sir John Vane found that aspirin blocks the body from making natural substances called prostaglandins .Prostaglandins have several effects on the body. Some cause pain and the expansion, or swelling( ; ), of damaged tissue. Others protect the lining of the stomach and small intestine. Prostaglandins also make the heart, kidneys and blood vessels  work well. But there is a problem. Aspirin works against all prostaglandins, good and bad. Scientists learned how aspirin interferes with an enzyme . One form of this enzyme makes the prostaglandin that causes pain and swelling. Another form of the enzyme creates a protective effect. So aspirin can reduce pain and swelling in damaged tissues. But it can also harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine . 
 Question:What can we know about aspirin according to the passage? 
A. Aspirin can treat almost diseases. 
B. Aspirin can create the protective enzyme. 
C. Aspirin can harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
D. Aspirin can protect the inside of the stomach and small intestine.

Context: Can you imagine that several hundred years ago, tomatoes were seen as _ food in Europe?
What made Europeans believe this was John Gerard's publication of Herbal in 1597. Gerard wrote: ""The leaves and stalks of the tomato plant are toxic."" Undoubtedly, Gerard's opinion was based on a misunderstanding of tomatoes. But his opinion was widely spread in Britain and North America for over two hundred years.
In the late 1700s, a lot of Europeans held more fears for tomatoes. A nick name for the fruit was ""poison apple"" because it was believed that aristocrats  got sick and died after eating them. But the actual reason was the pewter plates they used. Since tomatoes are high in acidity, when placed on the plates, the lead  in the plates would dissolve . This caused many deaths. Unluckily, no one knew this at that time. So the innocent tomatoes were picked as the killer.
Today, more than one and a half billion tons of tomatoes are produced every year around the world. Tomatoes are cooked in various ways. This healthy and tasty food finally wins its innocence  back. 
 Question:What's the key point for the death of the aristocrats mentioned in the passage? 
A. Tomatoes. 
B. The pewter plate. 
C. Serious illness. 
D. Chemical reaction. 
 Answer: D
Context: Chemicals used for industrial processes often create dangerous forms of waste. The amount of these chemicals has risen heavily in the past few years, as more areas of the world industrialize and new products are produced. Over 80,000 different chemicals are used in industries world wide. Around the world hundreds of millions of tons of harmful waste are produced each year. Often, it is difficult and expensive to get rid of these chemicals or to store them in a way that does not endanger human life and the environment.
     Every year, major health problems result from harmful waste. Sadly, it is often when someone has died or, become seriously ill that governments will take action and reduce levels of dumped harmful waste. In 1989, a school inprefix = st1 /New Jerseyhad to be closed because students there had suffered too much exposure to chromium. It was later learned that large amounts of chromium had been dumped nearby and blown over to the school area.
     Research has been done to provide information on the effects of every chemical. Because waste chemicals often mix together, it will also be necessary to learn how the combinations of these chemicals affect human health.
   Some governments have realized how serous the problem is and are making laws to get rid of harmful waste. They are also trying to limit the amount of waste industries are allowed to produce.
   Not only governments but the public as well must form part of the solution. They can choose not to buy those products which require the production of harmful waste, attempt to affect policymakers, and produce less harmful waste themselves. Many scientists think that waste production can be cut. The waste can be reduced by at least one-third using existing technologies and methods. 
 Question:From the text we know that   _  . 
A. chromium can poison people when there is a wind 
B. chromium pollution makes the local government close the school 
C. Some governments don't realize how serious the problems are until people suffer a lot from harmful waste 
D. about two-thirds of the waste can pollute the environment

Context: Scientists have discovered a gene  that plays a role in violence  in men ill-treated in childhood.The discovery could explain why some experience unhappy childhoods and go on to normal lives, while others turn to violence, crime of antisocial deeds. But it will also restart another argument.
Terrie Moffitt and Avshalom Caspi report in Science today that one common form of a gene in the brain makes men more likely to be violent--but only if they have experienced cruelty or rejection in childhood . The researchers followed up the life histories of 442 boys born in New Zealand in 1972. Of these, 154 had been ill-treated in the first 10 years, 33 of them badly. They had either experienced sexual attack, beatings or rejection by mother or stepparents. Of the 154 children , 55 had a less active variant  of a gene called MAOA, and 99 had the more active variant . The 55 boys were more than twice as likely to have been in trouble as the other ill-treated group . They made up 12% of the total, but were responsible for 44% of all crimes from among the 442 boys.
Prof Moffitt thought a ""violence"" gene had not been discovered. Boys with the less active form who were not ill-treated during childhood lived normal lives. ""It is very common in the population. One third of us have it."" she said, ""So the gene doesn't do much of anything, it doesn't cause any trouble in any way, unless we are also ill -treated"".
The gene might also show the ability to bear mental stress. The army or the police might examine the applicants  to see if they have the more active form . But the discovery also raises the argument that people with the less active form of the gene could be social dangers, to be treated with medicine. ""This research can easily lead people to fix social problems through medical treatment,"" said David King of the UK Gene Alert Group. 
 Question:According to the passage, the less active variant of the gene_. 
A. will totally determine men's character and behavior 
B. always leads to trouble-making 
C. might be responsible for boys' bad deeds 
D. plays no role in children's development 
 Answer: C
Context: Every living cell contains genes. They are too small to be seen in a microscope, but they are very important. Each set of genes in the body contains all the instructions needed to make a human being. Some genes determine hair color. Some determine the shape of a nose. Some genes help determine your height and even your weight.
Genes are made of a chemical called DNA-the letters stand for deoxyribonucleic acid . In the early 1950's, two scientists, Francis Crick and James Watson, figured out how the parts of DNA fit together. Once scientists understood this structure, it became possible to take pieces of DNA apart and put them together in new ways. New kinds of genes could be made in this manner.
Scientists have studied the genes of many plants and animals. They have worked out which genes affect the color of a tomato and the thickness of its skin. Working out which genes determine which features is called genetic mapping, scientists have begun the Human Genome Project, an ambitious effort to map all the genes in the human body.
Some genes may be defective . For example, something might be wrong with the gene that makes blood clot . A baby born with this defective gene could suffer serious hemorrhages  or even bleed to death because his or her blood fails to clot. If scientists ever learn how to map all the genes in our bodies, they can determine whether or not an unborn child has any defective genes. They might even discover how to treat these genes before the child is born. 
 Question:What is the main idea of this passage? 
A. Defective genes can never be repaired. 
B. Genes are too small to be seen through a microscope. 
C. Genes help scientists understand how living things develop their characteristics. 
D. The Human Genome Project may explain the role of every gene in the body. 
 Answer: C
Context: One baby born with a defective windpipe   now has hope of breathing normally thanks to 3-D printing technology, NPR reported.
Garrett Peterson, now 18 months old, was born with tracheomalacia  , leaving him unable to breathe. The condition terrified his parents, who turned to specialist Dr. Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment.
Along with Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer who runs the university's 3-D printing lab, Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett's windpipe until it's strong enough to function independently. After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the ""splint"" with a 3-D printer.
""It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,"" Green told NPR.
On January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs?
Though he still remains in the hospital, Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery.  His parents are overjoyed, saying he's starting to act more interactive and alert.
As Garrett grows, the splint will expand and eventually dissolve in his body as his own windpipe strengthens enough to work independently.
3-D printing technology has allowed doctors to help patients in ways that they hope will continue to grow.
""We're talking about taking something like dust and converting it into body parts,"" Green said. ""And we're able to do things that were never possible before."" 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that   _  . 
A. Garrett is out of hospital with the help of 3-D printing technology. 
B. The splint will exist in Garrett's body for ever. 
C. It is difficult to operate the 3-D printer. 
D. Garrett's condition is critical. 
 Answer: D
Context: One baby born with a defective windpipe   now has hope of breathing normally thanks to 3-D printing technology, NPR reported.
Garrett Peterson, now 18 months old, was born with tracheomalacia  , leaving him unable to breathe. The condition terrified his parents, who turned to specialist Dr. Glenn Green at the University of Michigan for a possible treatment.
Along with Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer who runs the university's 3-D printing lab, Green designed a device that can hold open Garrett's windpipe until it's strong enough to function independently. After taking a CT scan of Garrett's windpipe to make a replica of it, they made the ""splint"" with a 3-D printer.
""It's like a protective shell that goes on the outside of the windpipe, and it allows the windpipe to be tacked to the inside of that shell to open it up directly,"" Green told NPR.
On January 31, Garrett had his surgery. Surgeon Dr. Richard Ohye opened up Garrett's chest and saw that his windpipe had completely collapsed and one of his lungs was completely white -- a condition Ohye had only seen in dead bodies. After eight hours of surgery and careful placement of a splint on either side of Garrett's windpipe, it was time for the big test: What would happen when they let air flow through the windpipe into Garrett's lungs?
Though he still remains in the hospital, Garrett has gotten stronger and needs less assistance breathing in the weeks since his surgery.  His parents are overjoyed, saying he's starting to act more interactive and alert.

Context: Air is an odorless  , invisible   gas that surrounds the earth. It is everywhere on the planet. An ""empty"" drinking glass and an ""empty"" room, to give two examples, are not really empty. Each is filled with air. When the glass is filled with water, the water pushes the air out of the glass.
Air, as a gas, has no definite   shape, but, because it is matter, it takes up space. It is easy to prove that air is something that takes up space. _ a dry handkerchief into the bottom  of a glass so that it will not fall out when the glass is turned upside-down. Push the upside-down glass; hold it straight into a jar of water till the glass is completely covered. When the glass is taken out of water, the handkerchief will be dry. The air inside the glass takes up space and keeps the water from coming in.

Context: Every living thing on Earth is either a plant or an animal, right? Wrong! Many organisms in our world are neither. Some of them float through the air, and some lie hidden in the ground. They do not need sunlight to survive, and if the weather becomes too cold, they can become inactive until conditions improve.
What are these? They are called fungi , and you see them almost every day. Many kinds of fungi seem _ , such as the green black things that appear on the food which are left too long in the refrigerator. But other kinds are not so bad. For example, the yeast that is used to make bread and mushrooms   are both fungi.
What makes fungi different from plants and animals? An animal can move around by itself. Fungi get around too, but they don't have feet, wings, or tails. They have to wait for wind or some other outside force to move them. Plants are different from fungi because they have chlorophyll . It helps them make food from the energy in sunlight. Fungi do not have chlorophyll.
Some fungi are bad, while others are not. Some fungi cause diseases, such as athlete's foot, which makes feet uncomfortable. Other kinds of fungi can be used to make medicines, which have saved many lives.
Fungi clean up more than wounds, though. They are the world's first recyclers. Without fungi, our world would be a mess. Since fungi cannot make their own food as plants do, they must get their food elsewhere. Many fungi get their food from dead plants. They break them down and turn them into soil. The fungi get a meal, and the world gets a housecleaning. 
 Question:According to the passage,   _  . 
A. fungi can move everywhere by themselves 
B. fungi are unable to survive in cold conditions 
C. some fungi can make food from the energy in sunlight. 
D. some fungi are useful to humans and the environment 
 Answer: D
Context: It is generally believed that we are getting cleaned when we step under a shower. We are, but we're also giving a home to lots of tiny little creatures we didn't even know about. A showerhead carries thousands of bacteria called Mycobacterium.These can cause problems like coughs and tiredness, and a general feeling of poorliness  . When you turn on the water, the bacteria go from the showerhead onto and into your body.
This is a finding of Norman R. Pace and his team at the University of Colorado, in the US. The scientists investigated bacteria in all kinds of human environment, including showers.Pace's team looked at 45 showerheads in nine American cities. They discovered that 30 percent of them had large amounts of flying Mycobacterium.
But Pace said that they _ few threats to the health.Only those with a weak immune system might need to worry.He told the New York Times that the bacteria are not as unpleasant as might be thought.He said that having a shower is no more dangerous than anything else we do in the morning.
But for those who feel sick about the idea of all those microorganisms  , he had some advice. Let the water run for 30 seconds before getting into the shower. Why? The number of bacteria is smaller than that when the water is just turned on. If that seems like a waste of water, he added that you could also change your showerhead every few months.
However, Pace had good news too. He has also been testing the air in US subways. Apart from iron particles  , which are ground off the track by the wheels of trains, subway air is fresh. The reason is that a train's movement pumps fresh outdoor air into the tunnels.
Pace explained that he wanted to understand the natural microbial environments of public places. This kind of knowledge might help discover the microbes to be used in a bioterrorist   attack. 
 Question:From the finding of Norman R. Pace, after taking a shower, we might cough or feel tired because  _  . 
A. it's easy to get a cold when taking a bath 
B. the showerhead carries many bacteria causing illness 
C. we don't get cleaned while showering 
D. we don't get a weak immune system

Context: CANBERRA (Reuters Life!) - Think twice before eating those dropped crumbs off your computer keyboard -- you might as well be eating off a toilet seat, according to a new study on the amount of germs on keyboards.
A study by British ""Which? Computing"" asked a microbiologist to examine for bugs on 33 keyboards in a typical London office, a toilet seat and a toilet door handle.
Four keyboards were judged potential health hazards and the microbiologist recommended the removal of one keyboard as it had 150 times the pass limit of bacteria -- five times filthier than the swabbed toilet seat.
""Most people don't give much thought to the grime that builds up on their PC, but if you don't clean your computer, you might as well eat your lunch off the toilet,"" said Sarah Kidner, the consumer magazine editor of ""Which? Computing"" in a statement.
The study found that eating lunch at desks is the main cause of a bug-infested keyboard. Dropped crumbs and food encourages the growth of millions of bacteria.
Poor personal hygiene, such as not washing hands after going to the toilet, may also add to the dirtiness of keyboards.
But despite the health hazard of a dirty keyboard, a survey of 4,000 people by the magazine found one in 10 people ever cleaned their keyboard while another two in 10 never cleaned their mouse.
Almost half -- or 46 per cent -- cleaned their keyboard less than once a month.
To clear out bugs, the magazine recommends users unplug keyboards, turn them upside down and shake them. 
 Question:What do you think the expression ""Think twice before eating those dropped crumbs off your computer keyboard"" stands for? 
A. Think several times before eating beside your computer 
B. Don't drop foods onto the computer keyboard. 
C. Don't eat foods dropped onto the computer keyboard. 
D. Be careful when you are eating by the computer. 
 Answer: C
Context: Plants, like animals, are subject to diseases of various kinds.It has been estimated that some 30,000 different diseases attack our economic plants; forty are known to attack corn, and about as many attack wheat.The results of unchecked plant disease are all too obvious in countries which have marginal food supplies.The problem will soon be more widespread as the population of the world increases at its frightening rate.Even in countries which are now amply fed by their agricultural products there could soon be the major crops; the resulting famines  could kill millions of people, and the resulting hardship on other millions could cause political upheavals  disastrous to the order of the world.
Some plants have relative immunity to a great many diseases, while others have a susceptibility to them.A blight   may be but a local infection easily controlled; on the other hand it can attack particular plants in a whole region or nation.An example is the blight which killed virtually every chestnut tree in North America.Another is the famous potato blight in Ireland in the last century.As a result of that, it was estimated that one million people died of starvation and related ailments.
Plant pathologists have made remarkable strides in identifying the pathogens of the various diseases.Bacteria may invade a plant through an infestation of insect parasites carrying the pathogen.A plant can also be inoculated by man.Other diseases might be caused by fungus which attacks the plant in the form of a model or smut or rust.Frequently such a primary infection will weaken the plant so that a secondary infection may result form its lack of tolerance.The symptoms  shown may cause an error in diagnosis, so that treatment may be directed toward bacteria  which could be the result of a susceptibility caused by a primary virus infection. 
 Question:How many diseases are known to attack wheat? 
A. Around 30000 
B. Forty 
C. Around 29960 
D. Around 40

Context: From babies to body builders, we all have muscles. They grow, they bulge , they stretch they stretch and sometimes they even painfully pull. But for all the work they do for us, we are still unable to crown one as ""the strongest muscle.""
Instead, a few muscles could claim the title, depending on how strength is measured.
If the title goes to the muscle that can exert  the most force, the victor would be the soleus , according to Gray's Anatomy . Without this muscle, we wouldn't be able to stand, walk, run or shake our bodies on the dance floor. If the soleus was not continuously pulling, we would always be falling over ourselves (although some of us tend to do that from time to time anyway).
But perhaps the title should go to the muscle that exerts the most pressure. Pressure is different from force -- pressure takes into account the area over which a force is exerted. The muscle that takes the prize for delivering the greatest amount of pressure is the masseter, or the jaw muscle, according to the book ""Clinical Oral Science"" (Reed Educational and Professional Publishing, 1998).
In 1986, Richard Hofmann of Lake City, Fla., achieved a bite strength of 975 pounds (442 kilograms) for two seconds, setting a Guinness Record. Talk about jaw dropping! The jaw is able to clench  and chew because of the masseter muscle.
Others may argue the muscles used in childbirth are the most powerful.
When it comes to versatility, perhaps the tongue is the strongest muscle. Its combination of elasticity  and forcefulness gives us the ability to speak, eat and kiss - all things very desirable on a first date. However dexterous  it may be though, its power does not match that of muscles such as the soleus.
If slow and steady wins the race, the heart is certainly a _ for the title. When it contracts, the muscle pumps about 2 ounces (59 milliliters) of blood, and is constantly working over a lifetime. Beating about 40 million times a year, a person's heart will beat approximately 2.5 billion times by the time of their 70th birthday. 
 Question:Which would be t he best title for the passage? 
A. What's the strongest muscle in the human body? 
B. who is the strongest person in the world? 
C. What are the functions of different muscles? 
D. What are the standards of the strongest muscle?

Context: Have you ever seen a horse with toes ?Millions of years ago, horses had many toes. They had four toes on each front foot. They had three toes on each back foot. The horses were no bigger than the cats.These small horses lived in the forest. The toes helped the horses run on the soft, wet ground.
At first, it was very hot in the forest. But the weather changed. It became very cold. Many trees could not live in cold weather. The trees died and fell. Open fields took the place of forests. The sun made the ground dry and hard.
Horsed began to change, too. They began to get bigger. This took a long time. On the dry, hard land, horses needed only their middle toes for running. Their middle toes became hard. After a long time, horses had only one hard toe on each foot. Now we call this hard toe a

Context: People who are worried about bad breath often reach for a toothbrush or a gun. But in the future, personal breath monitoring may include far more than fresh breath.
In face, breath is so rich in chemical compounds that fully understanding it has proved challenging. Each breath contains gases like carbon dioxide, the volatile remains of recent snacks, medicines and even compounds taken in from things like carpeting or various kinds of air pollution. But breath detectors  can sort out these substances with increasing sensitivity . 
Scientists are building electronic sniffers that examine the exhaled air for signs of cancer, asthma , and other diseases.
""There are clear signatures in the breath for liver disease, kidney disease and heart disease. Breath is a rich mixture that can reflect out state of health and disease."" said Dr. Raed Dweik, director of the Cleveland Clinic, adding ""Breath analysis is the future of medical testing.""
He and his partners are testing a desktop system called BreathLink for use in rapid identification of diseases. The system is designed to work wherever there is an Internet connection. To use BreathLink, a person breathes into a long tube, and a breath sample is collected and analyzed within the system. Then it can detail chemical concentrations of the breath in graphics. Dr. Raed Dweik said, ""If you examine patients of asthma, you will find they have higher levels of nitric oxide  in their exhaled air. It reflects their abnormal symptoms in the lungs."" His tests have reached 85 percent accuracy so far in spotting people with some illness.
But some trained dogs, he pointed out, can sniff out cancer with 99 percent accuracy--although without the ability to identify particular compounds the way some detectors can.
""We are getting better and better,"" he said. ""But whether we will ever approach the accuracy of the dog--we don't know."" 
 Question:It can be inferred that  _ 
A. brushing teeth can improve one's bad breath 
B. there are leftovers like snacks and medicines in one's breath 
C. one can know exactly about his physical state through the breath 
D. breath analysis can be helpful in medical diagnosis

Context: Neddine Parker is up by 7 in the morning. After her morning exercises and some housework, she drives to the local hospital, where she volunteers once a week. What makes Parker's routine so extraordinary is that she is 104 years old.
""I don't know why I'm still here,"" she said.
Dr. Thomas Perls of the Boston University Medical Center is trying to figure that out. As the director of the New England Centenarian   Study, he studies there ""super humans"", those age 100 years and older.
""It's like winning the lottery"", he said. ""You've got to choose the right numbers and the right combination.""
Researchers believe about 30 percent of aging is genetic. For those who get to extremely old ages, family history may play an even more important role.
Reuben Landau's mother lived to 100, and three of his brothers and sisters into their 90s. Landau is nearly 102, and he still practices law a few hours every day. Both Landau and Parker are remarkably healthy. They take few medications and have no major illness.
Perls has found that many centenarians lack a type of gene -- E4 -- that is associated with an increased risk of heart disease. One study found the gene is in 29 percent of young men, but only 15 percent of centenarians. Perls also believes they may have a ""protective gene"", one that helps them survive what might kill others. Parker, for example, smoked until she was 100 and had a stroke at 89.
However, living into your 100s isn't just genetics. Aging successfully has much to do with environment and behavior. Landau watches what he eats and exercises his body and mind every day. He's convinced it's why he's still in good health. ""People still have to do the right things to get to very old age,"" said Perls. So it's not just the cards you're dealt, but how you play the hand. 
 Question:Why are Landau and Parker remarkably healthy according to the research? 
A. Because they are remarkably active in mind. 
B. Because they lack a gene linked to illness. 
C. Because they are fond of social work. 
D. Because they enjoy sports and housework.

Context: Finally, there is some good news for older dads. A new study shows that their children and even grandchildren may get a health benefit because of their older age. It's based on research into something called telomeres--tips on the ends of chromosomes 
    Some previous studies have connected having longer telomeres with better health and longer lives. Telomeres haven't been proven to cause those benefits in the general population, but a number of researchers think they may hold secrets for things like longevity and cancer.
    As you age, telomeres shorten. However, previous studies have shown that the older a man is when he becomes a father, the longer the telomeres his children tend to have. The new research confirms that and finds it's extended to the grandchildren. That's a cheerier result for older dads than some other studies in recent years that indicate their kids are at higher risk for things like autism 
    Carol Greider of Johns Hopkins University, who shared a Nobel Prize in 2009 for telomere research but didn't participate in the new study, said it's no surprise that the telomere effect would extend beyond children to grandchildren. She also said that since older fathers also tend to pass more potentially harmful genetic mutations , it's ""not at all clear"" whether advanced paternal  age gives an overall health benefit to children. In a statement, the researchers who conducted the study said their study shouldn't be taken as a recommendation that men reproduce at older ages because there's a risk of genetic mutations.
    Some previous studies of the impact of older fatherhood have been less encouraging. In 2010, for example, at least two big studies confirmed a link to having children with autism. In 2008, a big Swedish study strengthened evidence linking bipolar disorder  to older paternal ages.

Context: Every living cell contains genes. They are too small to be seen in a microscope, but they are very important. Each set of genes in the body contains all the instructions needed to make a human being. Some genes determine hair color. Some determine the shape of a nose. Some genes help determine your height and even your weight.
Genes are made of a chemical called DNA-the letters stand for deoxyribonucleic acid . In the early 1950's, two scientists, Francis Crick and James Watson, figured out how the parts of DNA fit together. Once scientists understood this structure, it became possible to take pieces of DNA apart and put them together in new ways. New kinds of genes could be made in this manner.
Scientists have studied the genes of many plants and animals. They have worked out which genes affect the color of a tomato and the thickness of its skin. Working out which genes determine which features is called genetic mapping, scientists have begun the Human Genome Project, an ambitious effort to map all the genes in the human body.
Some genes may be defective . For example, something might be wrong with the gene that makes blood clot . A baby born with this defective gene could suffer serious hemorrhages  or even bleed to death because his or her blood fails to clot. If scientists ever learn how to map all the genes in our bodies, they can determine whether or not an unborn child has any defective genes. They might even discover how to treat these genes before the child is born. 
 Question:What is the main idea of this passage? 
A. Defective genes can never be repaired. 
B. Genes are too small to be seen through a microscope. 
C. Genes help scientists understand how living things develop their characteristics. 
D. The Human Genome Project may explain the role of every gene in the body.

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. "" 
 Question:Jennie gave her bone marrow to   _  . 
A. a close friend 
B. a stranger

Context: Do you know why people look the way they look? What inside our bodies makes us grow in a certain way? The answer is DNA. It was first discovered by a young Swiss doctor in 1868.
DNA is like a computer program for your body. Almost every cell  in your body includes DNA. The way DNA in the cell decides why you are the way you are. For example your friend might have larger ears than you. This is because their DNA is different from yours.
DNA lives in the cell and is ordered in a structure called a ""double helix "". In each double helix there are links called as chromosomes . These chromosomes are made from four bases that arrange themselves in millions of different ways. The way these bases choose to line up is what makes the DNA code for that cell.
DNA is also called a ""gene "". This is a very interesting thing. Genes are passed down from your parents. That is why you might have the same smile like your dad's or mom's!
In February, scientists found the skeleton  of Richard III, King of England from 1483-1485, under a car park in England. It seems unlikely that scientists could identify a 527-year-old skeleton. However, they matched the skeleton's DNA to a sample from one of his direct descendants . How amazing! 
 Question:What is the main function of ""genes""?

B. They make your children have the same smile as you. 
C. They make your children stay healthy.

Context: It seems to be strange that there is a blind spot in the eye. Here is an interesting experiment   that can make something _ when one eye is open.
Make a card about the size of a postcard and write two English letters ""L"" and ""R"" on it. ""L"" is on the left and ""R"" on the right. First, hold the card about 80 cm away and you can see both the letters. Then close your right eye and look at the letter ""R"" only with your left eye. And now, as you move the card slowly towards you, you'll find the letter ""L"" disappearing. But if you move the card nearer to your face, the letter will be seen again. Now do the same experiment with your left eye closed; you'll find the letter ""R"" disappearing.
Why do the letters disappear? It is because there is a blind spot in the eye. When the image   of the letter falls on the blind spot, it won't be seen. That's why one of the letters disappears.

Context: ""Mister D'Arcy is not a policeman. He is, however, very wise. He knew the police would search his apartment. He also knew how police think. So, he did not hide the letter where he knew they would look for it.
""Do you remember how Germont laughed when I said the mystery was difficult for him to solve because it was so simple?""
Dupin filled his pipe with tobacco and lit it. ""Well, the more I thought about it, the more I realized the police could not find the letter because D'Arcy had not hidden it at all.
""So I went to visit D'Arcy in his apartment. I took a pair of dark green eyeglasses with me. I explained to him that I was having trouble with my eyes and needed to wear the dark glasses at all times. He believed me. The glasses permitted me to look around the apartment while I seemed only to be talking to him.
""I paid special attention to a large desk where there were a lot of papers and books. However, I saw nothing suspicious there. After a few minutes, however, I noticed a small shelf over the fireplace. A few postcards and a letter were lying on the shelf. The letter looked very old and dirty.
""As soon as I saw this letter, I decided it must be the one I was looking for. It must be, even though it was completely different from the one Germont had described.
""This letter had a large green stamp on it. The address was written in small letters in blue ink. I memorized every detail of the letter while I talked to D'Arcy. Then when he was not looking, I dropped one of my gloves on the floor under my chair.
""The next morning, I stopped at his apartment to look for my glove. While we were talking, we heard people shouting in the street. D'Arcy went to the window and looked out. Quickly, I stepped to the shelf and put the letter in my pocket. Then I replaced it with a letter that looked exactly like it, which I had made it the night before.
""The trouble in the street was caused by a man who had almost been run over by a horse and carriage. He was not hurt. And soon the crowd of people went away. When it was over, D'Arcy came away from the window. I said goodbye and left.
""The man who almost had an accident was one of my servants . I had paid him to create the incident.""
Dupin stopped talking to light his pipe. I did not understand. ""But, Dupin,"" I said, ""why did you go to the trouble of replacing the letter? Why not just take it and leave?""
Dupin smiled. ""D'Arcy is a dangerous man,"" he said. ""And he has many loyal servants. If I had taken the letter, I might never have left his apartment alive.""

A. An actor. 
B. A professor. 
C. An official. 
D. A detective.

Context: I had been to several doctors as a child, but I have a special place in my heart for Dr. Vincent. He was a Pediatric Cardiologist at UCLA back in 1971 who saved my life. I was eight years old at the time with a severe heart problem and I needed heart surgery. My Mom did not have the money, and without the surgery there was a real good chance I would not live to be thirteen years old. After contacting several organizations Dr. Vincent was able to get financial help for me through United Way, a Crippled Children's Organization.
Dr. Vincent was a handsome man; he was also very gentle and caring. I remember being in the hospital for an Angiogram test, and during the procedure I was crying terribly, so the medical staff called in Dr. Vincent to calm me down, and he was able to comfort me when no one else could. Then the time came for me to have heart surgery; there was a fifty- percent chance that I would not make it through the surgery because it was experimental. At the time I was only the second or third person to have this procedure done. I was absolutely terrified, and again Dr. Vincent reassured me he would see to it that everything would be all right.
I had a lot of confidence and trust in Dr. Vincent; He came to see me after the surgery, which was extremely painful but very successful, and brought me a stuffed animal. I was so surprised to get this gift from Dr. Vincent; I gave him a hug. I guess Dr. Vincent must have known I was feeling very lonely and scared. You see, I had no family or friends visit me while I was in the hospital except for my Mom, and I am not sure why. I do know one thing; I had a wonderful doctor who took the time to help a scared little girl who felt all alone.
This was twenty eight years ago, so wherever you are Dr. Vincent, I want to thank you for not only saving my life, but you helped me live a normal productive life, and for showing me that you truly cared, for that I will be eternally grateful to you. 
 Question:Which of the following is true except   _  . 
A. the operation was experimental. 
B. she didn't trust in Dr. Vincent 
C. the operation would be extremely painful

Context: It is well-known that when an individual joins a group, he tends to accept the group's standards of behavior and thinking. Many illustrations could be given of this from everyday life, but what is of particular interest to psychologists is the extent to which people's judgments and opinions can be changed as a result of group pressure, Asch and others noticed that people in a group will agree to statements that are contrary to the evidence of their senses. It would be a mistake to think that only particularly docile people are chosen to take part in experiments of this type. Usually highly intelligent and independent people are used. In a typical experiment, this is what may happen.
   The experimenter asks for volunteers to join a group which is investigating visual perception .The victims are not, therefore, aware of the real purpose of the experiment. Each volunteer is taken to a room where he finds a group of about seven people who are cooperating with the experimenter. The group is shown a standard card which contains a single line. They are then asked to look at a second card. This has three lines on it. One is obviously longer than the line on the first card; one is shorter and one the same length. They have to say which line on the second card is the same length as the line on the standard card. The other members of the group answer first but what the volunteer does not know is that they have been told to pick one of the wrong lines. When his turn comes, he is faced with the unanimous opinion of the rest of the group-all the others have chosen line A but he quite clearly sees line B as correct. What will be do? According to Asch, more than half of the vietims chosen will change their opinion. What is equally surprising is that, when interviewed about their answers, most explained that they knew the group choice was incorrect but that they gave in to the pressure of the group because they thought they must be suffering from an optical illusion , or because they were afraid of being different. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is true? 
A. The experimenter and all the members of the group except the victim know the purpose of the experiment. 
B. All of them know the purpose of the experiment. 
C. Only the experimenter knows the purpose of the experiment. 
D. Only the victim knows the purpose of the experiment

Context: There are various reasons why cancers appear to be on the increase. For one thing, though their sufferers are to be found in all age groups, cancers are particularly likely to attack persons in their middle and advanced years. Naturally, since people live longer these years, there are more cancer sufferers than before. Again, with better methods of diagnosis  , doctors can more easily recognize cancerous growths that would formerly have passed unnoticed or that would have been wrongly diagnosed. It is also believed that certain habits and conditions of modern living, including heavy smoking and the pollution of the air, may leave people living in more cancer-causing conditions than before.
We all look forward to the day when a simple medical test can find cancer while it is still small. Researchers around the world are working on _ . Most of their work deals with the examination of the blood.
Researchers in Boston have found something in the blood of cancer patients that does not appear in healthy persons. The test showed which persons had cancer and which did not. It was correct more than 90 percent of the time.
The researchers believe the test may be able to show cancer very clearly in its development. Cancers discovered early usually can be treated successfully.
The test examines very small bits of fat in the blood called lipids  . Cancers seem to change lipids although doctors do not know why. The test showed differences between the lipids of the persons with cancer and the lipids of those without cancer.
The researchers say the new test could be a step to develop a simple way to check patients for cancer before the disease shows on an X-ray.

Context: Many people have never heard of Mesothelioma and are unaware of its symptoms. Although considered a rare form of cancer, each year the number of cases grows. With the prevalence of this disease on the rise, it is critical to understand why and how Mesothelioma develops and what courses of action can be taken in the event of diagnosis. The following is a list of frequently asked questions and answers that will provide you with some information on Mesothelioma, and the legal issues surrounding it.
What is Mesothelioma?
Mesothelioma is the term used to describe a cancerous tumor found in the mesothelial cells of an organ. The organs where this form of cancer is most commonly found are the lungs, heart and abdominal organs. Pleural Mesothelioma is cancer of the lung lining(,)and is the most common form of Mesothelioma.
What causes Mesothelioma?
Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos . Asbestos is often found in building materials used before the mid 1970's. In addition, materials such as pipes, boiler insulation, floor, ceiling and roof tiles may contain asbestos.
How much asbestos exposure will cause Mesothelioma?
Generally, the probability of developing this form of cancer is in accordance with the length of time you are exposed to asbestos. Also, your health is at risk if your exposure to asbestos is intense. It should be noted that Mesothelioma has a latency period of 20 to 50 years. This means that you may develop the disease long after your exposure to asbestos. On average, people tend to develop Mesothelioma somewhere between 35 and 40 years after exposure.
How quickly does Mesothelioma progress?
The onset of Mesothelioma is quite slow. Patients will begin to experience symptoms such as lower back pain and chest pain. These symptoms may also be accompanied by weight loss, fever and difficulty breathing. Unfortunately, once Mesothelioma develops, it quickly becomes aggressive and treatment must be sought immediately.
Can Mesothelioma be treated?
Doctors are able to use several traditional methods of cancer treatment for Mesothelioma, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Like all forms of cancer, detecting the disease at the earliest stage possible greatly increases the patient's chances for survival. If you have worked in an industry such as construction or suspect that you may have been exposed to asbestos, be alert for symptoms and contact your doctor immediately.
What legal courses of action can be taken?
Anyone suffering from Mesothelioma is entitled to compensation from asbestos manufacturers. Additionally, if you are the spouse or child of someone who has died from Mesothelioma, you are entitled to file a claim and seek compensation. 
 Question:We can learn from the text that   _  . 
A. Asbestos is to blame for Mesothelioma. 
B. Even if a person is exposed to asbestos for a while, he will die soon. 
C. All the employees can ask for compensation from asbestos manufacturers. 
D. Mesothelioma is a cancer familiar to many people.

Context: One Monday morning, Paul and his classmates were in science laboratory for their practical chemistry lesson. The students were going to work in pairs to do an experiment. Before they began, the teacher gave them this description of the different stages of the experiment.
Stage 1: Prepare the equipment: a test tube, a crucible, a Bunsen burner and tongs.
Stage 2: Weigh 5 grams of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and put it in a crucible.
Stage 3: Heat 10 ml of hydrochloric acid   in a test tube.
Stage 4: Pour the warm acid onto the baking soda and continue to heat the mixture.
Result: The acid reacts with the bicarbonate to form water, carbon dioxide gas and salt. The hotter the mixture, the quicker the reaction. Continue to heat the mixture until the water evaporates, leaving the salt in the crucible.
Paul and his partner followed the instructions and set up their equipment. Paul went to the cupboard to get a bottle of hydrochloric acid. He found that there was only one bottle in the cupboard so he took that. There was no label on the bottle and Paul didn't check with the teacher if it was the right solution.
He measured the liquid and poured it into a test tube. Using tongs to hold the test tube, he heated it over the Bunsen burner. That's when things started to go wrong. The liquid in the test tube was not hydrochloric acid. When it was heated, it formed a thick cloud of white gas. Soon the room was full of this strong smelling white gas.
All the students started coughing and their eyes hurt. The teacher immediately opened the windows and ordered the students to leave the laboratory at once. She realized that the liquid was a crylamide   and that it is poisonous.
Fortunately, nobody was injured in the incident. However, it taught the students and the teacher a good lesson. 
 Question:What substance were the students making in the experiment? 
A. Water 
B. Carbon dioxide gas 
C. Salt 
D. Poisonous gas

Context: Health experts have long worried about the increasing rate of obesity in kids. It's an important concern: Being weight or obese during childhood can lead to serious problems normally seen in adults, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Poor diets and a lack of exercise are usually the causes. But would you ever have imagined there might be a connection between the bacteria that lived in your guts  when you were a baby and the chance that you would become overweight?
Scientists in Finland recently found just such a link. In a recent study, they showed that overweight kids had different species of bacteria living in their guts.
You probably think of bacteria only as germs that can make you sick. While it's true that some bacteria can make people ill, your body actually depends on some types of bacteria to help you digest food and extract nutrients from it. These ""good"" bacteria live in your guts, where they process the food you eat.
Human babies get these bacterial helpers from their moms. When a baby is born, some of the bacteria in the mother move into the baby's body. Growing babies get additional ""good"" bacteria from the milk their mothers produce. And it turns out the bacteria might play an important role in regulating weight just six years later.
So how could these bacteria affect weight? The researchers still haven't tested that question, but future tests might lead to an answer. 
 Question:The purpose of writing this passage is to   _  . 
A. introduce the role of bacteria in children's weight 
B. analyze the influence of obesity on kids 
C. give advice on how to lose weight quickly 
D. explain the function of bacteria in foods 
 Answer: A
Context: Women who own cats are more likely to have mental health problems and kill themselves because they can be infected by a common parasite that can be caught from cat litter, a study has found.
Researchers found women infected with the Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) parasite , which is spread through contact with cat waste or eating undercooked meat or unwashed vegetables, are at increased risk of attempting suicide.
The study involved more than 45,000 women in Denmark. About a third of the world's population is infected with the parasite, which hides in cells in the brain and muscles, often without producing symptoms.
The infection, which is called toxoplasmosis , has been linked to mental illness, such as schizophrenia , and changes in behavior.
The study's senior author Doctor Teodor Postolache, an associate professor of psychiatry  at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in the United States, said, ""We can't say with certainty that T. gondii caused the women to try to kill themselves, but we did find a predictive association between the infection and suicide attempts later in life that deserves additional studies.""
Doctor Albert Reece, vice president of medical affairs at the University of Maryland, said, ""T. gondii infection is a major public health problem around the world, and many people don't realize they're infected.
""Dr Postolache is a leading expert on suicide neuroimmunology . Suicide is a critically important mental health issue. About one million people commit suicide and another 10 million attempt suicide worldwide each year. We hope that this type of research will one day help us find ways to save many lives that now end too early in suicide.""
Dr. Postolache's research team at the University of Maryland was the first to report a connection between T. gondii and suicidal behavior in 2009. He is cooperating with researchers in Denmark, Germany and Sweden to confirm and investigate the way leading to this association.
The T. gondii parasite thrives in the intestines of cats, and it is spread through their waste. All warm-blooded animals can become infected through contact with it. Humans can become infected by changing their infected cats' litter boxes, eating unwashed vegetables, drinking water from a polluted source, or by eating undercooked or raw meat.
Not washing kitchen knives after preparing raw meat before handling another food item also can lead to infection. Pregnant women can pass the parasite directly to their unborn babies and are advised not to change cat litter boxes to avoid possible infection.
Babies don't produce antibodies to T. gondii for three months after they are born, so the antibodies present in their blood represented infection in the mothers. The scientists studied Danish health patients to determine if any of these women later attempted suicide, including cases of violent suicide attempts which may have involved guns, sharp instruments and jumping from high places.
The study found that women infected with T. gondii were one and a half times more likely to attempt suicide compared to those who were not infected, and the risk seemed to rise with increasing levels of the T. gondii antibodies.
Dr Postolache noted limitations to the study, such as the inability to determine the cause of the suicidal behavior.
The findings were published online in the Archives of General Psychiatry. 
 Question:What is the consequence if a woman is infected with the parasite in the passage? 
A. Having a high fever. 
B. Doing deliberate self-harm. 
C. Keeping a depressed mood. 
D. Becoming bad tempered.

 Answer: A
Context: For decades, public health officials have puzzled over a surprising fact about HIV: Only about 10-20 percent of infants who are breastfed by infected mothers catch the virus. Tests show, though, that HIV is indeed present in breast milk, so these children are exposed to the virus multiple times daily for the first several months of their lives.
Now, a group of scientists and doctors from Duke University has figured out why these babies don't get infected. Human breast milk naturally contains a protein called Tenascin C that neutralizes HIV and, in most cases, prevents it from being passed from mother to child. Eventually, they say, the protein could potentially be valuable as an HIV-fighting tool for both infants and adults that are either HIV-positive or at risk of contracting the infection.
The research, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was inspired by previous work by other researchers showing that, both in tissue cultures   and live mice, breast milk from HIV-negativemothers was naturally endowed with HIV-fighting properties. Scientists suggested that a few different proteins in the milk could potentially be responsible, but no one knew which one.
As part of the study, the researchers divided breast milk into smaller fractions   made up of specific proteins via a number of filters   -- separating the proteins by size, electrical charge and other characteristics--and tested which of these fractions, when added to a tissue culture, prevented the cells from being infected by HIV. Eventually, they found that one particular protein was present in all the HIV-resistant fractions but in none of the others: Tenascin C.
Tenascin C works by blocking a key protein on HIV's envelope that normally ties up to a receptor on a T cell's membrane called CCR5. In doing so, Tenascin C prevents HIV from mixing with the T cell and injecting its RNA inside.
Still, the researchers say that other natural elements in milk might play a role in fighting HIV as well. ""It's clearly not the whole story, because we do have samples that have low amounts of this protein but still have HIV-neutralizing activity,"" the study's lead author Permar says. ""So it may be acting in concert with other antiviral and antimicrobial factors in the milk.""
Whatever those other factors are, though, the finding vindicates (......) recent changes to UN guidelines that recommend even HIV-positive mothers in resource-poor countries should breastfeed, if they're taking anti-retroviral drugs to combat their own infection.
The next steps, Permar says, are determining which area of Tenascin C is active and whether it can effectively prevent transmission in a live animal. If it works, it could potentially be incorporated   into an HIV drug with broader applications. It's even possible that it could someday be adapted to reduce the risk of HIV transmission in adults as well as infants. 
 Question:Which of the following about Tenascin C is true? 
A. It has become an effective tool in fighting HIV. 
B. It was first found by Permar and her research group. 
C. It can prevent transmission in a live animal effectively. 
D. It can sometimes prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

Context: Have you ever asked yourself why you have two eyes instead of one, three, or even hundreds as some insects have? Have you wondered why your eyes are set close together on the front of your face rather than on the sides of your head, as on animals like rabbits, antelopes, and horses? The reasons are simple -- and important to the way you see the rest of your world. 
         Your eyes are like two small cameras. A camera catches an image of an object and records this image in miniature on a small piece of film. Similarly, when you look at something, each eye takes in what it sees and sends this image to the back of the eyeball. From each eye, an optic nerve then sends the image to the brain. Because your eyes are set close together, they view the world from about the same height but from slightly different angles. While your right eye sees an object a little to the right, your left eye sees the same object slightly to the left. Working as a team, the eyes send the images to the part of your brain called the cerebral cortex, which combines them into a single, centered image. 
        Seeing with two eyes working together is called stereoscopic vision. This allows you to view the world in three dimensions, or 3-D. These dimensions are height, width, and depth. Sensing depth allows you to judge the distance between you and the objects you see. It also helps you to adjust to the changing angle at which you see something as you move closer to or farther away from it. As you walk along a sidewalk, for example, seeing in stereo helps you to know how close you are to the street, how far you need to walk to arrive at a certain building, and how close you are to stepping on a rock or a piece of glass. As your body moves, your eyes give you a continual flow of information about where things are in relation to where you are. 
         If images are coming from only one eye, however, only two of these dimensions - height and width - can be sensed. A world seen with one eye is thus two-dimensional, as in a photograph. The sense of depth is lacking, making it more difficult to move around safely. 
         Now consider why your two eyes are located on the front of your face. Think of other animals with this same arrangement. Some examples are lions, wolves, and owls. What do these creatures have in common? They are all animals that hunt. These animals have eyes facing directly in front of them. This provides a field of vision that is about 180 degrees wide, like a half-circle. This kind of sight is called binocular vision. 
         On the other hand, animals that are hunted have eyes on the sides of the head. This provides nearly a 360-degree field of vision. Because these animals need to de ready to run at any moment in order to stay alive, they need to see things coming from the sides and from behind. However, without stereoscopic vision, these animals have a more difficult time determining how far away a threat is.

Context: Six-month-old babies are strictly limited in what they can remember about the objects they see in the world. If you hide several objects from babies, they will only remember one of those objects. But a new study, which was published in an issue of Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, finds that when babies ""forget"" about an object, not all is lost. Researchers used to think that babies less than two years old did not understand that an object continues to exist when it is not in the baby's view. But in mid-1980s, new ways of doing experiments with babies found that they do, in fact, know that objects don't disappear when they do not look at them -- a concept known as object permanence. But it was still unknown what babies needed to remember about objects in order to remember their existence.
Now Melissa Kibbe, of John Hopkins University, and Alan Leslie, of Rutgers University, are working to figure out exactly what it is that babies remember about objects. For the new study, they showed six-month-old babies two objects, a disk and a triangle. Then they hid the objects behind small screens, first one shape, then the other. Earlier research has shown that young babies can remember what was hidden most recently, but have more trouble remembering the first object that was hidden. Once the shapes were hidden, they lifted the screen in front of the first object. Sometimes they showed babies the shape that was hidden there originally  , but sometimes it was the other shape, and sometimes the object had _ completely.
Psychologists   measure how long babies look at something to see how surprised they are. In Kibbe and Leslie's study, babies weren't particularly surprised to see that screen had changed, for example, from a triangle to a disk. But if the object was gone altogether, the babies looked significantly longer, indicating surprise at an unexpected outcome: ""This shows that even though babies don't remember the shape of the object, they know that it should continue to exist,"" Kibbe says. ""They remember the object without remembering the features that identify that object.""
This helps explain how the young brain processes information about objects, Leslie say. He thinks the brain has a structure that acts like a kind of pointer, a mental finger that points at an object. 
 Question:Which would be the best title for the passage? 
A. A new concept -- object permanence 
B. All remembered isn't lost 
C. What babies remember about objects 
D. A new study on psychology

Context: At a primary school in a small town in the east of South Carolina, second-grade teachers Carneau and Lynne are convinced that separating primary boys and girls produces immediate academic improvement in both genders  
David Chadwell, South Carolina's coordinator  of single gender education says, "" Boys and girls learn,hear and respond to their surroundings differently. We can teach boys and girls based on what we now know.""
Male and female eyes are not organized in the same way,he explains. The composition of the male eye makes it sensitive to motion and direction. "" Boys interpret  the world as objects moving through space,"" he says.
The male eye is also drawn to cooler color1s like silver and black. It's no accident that boys tend to create pictures of moving objects instead of drawing the happy color1ful family,as girls do in class.
The female eye,on the other hand,is drawn to warmer color1s like red, yellow and orange. To attract girls, Chadwell says, the teacher doesn't need to move as much as in boys' class. Using descriptive phrases and lots of color1s in presentations or on the blackboard gets their attention.
Boys and girls also hear differently. "" When someone speaks in a loud tone,girls interpret it as yelling, "" says Chadwell. "" They think you're mad and can shut down. "" Girls are more sensitive to sounds. He advises girls' teachers to watch the tone of their voices. Boys' teachers should sound more forceful, even excited.
A boy's nervous system causes him to be more cautious when he is standing, moving, and the room temperature is around 6.Stress in boys,he says, tends to increase blood flow to their brains, a process that helps them stay focused. Girls are more focused when they are seated in a warmer room around 75degF. Girls also respond to stress differently. When exposed to threat and conflict, blood goes to their guts  ,leaving them feeling nervous or anxious.
These differences can be applied in the classroom, Chadwell adds. "" Single gender programs are about maximizing the learning."" 
 Question:What is David Chadwell's attitude towards separating primary boys and girls while learning? 
A. Worried. 
B. Concerned. 
C. Supportive. 
D. Uninterested.

Context: Hands play an important part in our daily life. But do you know which of your two hands you use more? Very few people use both hands _ well .Most of us are right-handed. Only about five people out of a hundred are left-handed.  New-born babies can take hold of things with either of their hands, but in about two years they usually use their right hands.  Scientists don't know why this happens.
Monkeys are our close relatives  in the animal world. Scientists have found that monkeys like to use one of their hands more than the other, but it can be either hand. There are as many right-handed monkeys as left-handed ones. Next time you visit a zoo, watch the monkeys carefully, you will see that some of them will use their right hands and others will use their left hands. But most of the people use their right hands better and this makes life difficult for those left-handed people. We live in a right-handed world. 
 Question:New-born babies can use  _  .. 
A. both of their hands 
B. neither of their hands 
C. their right hands 
D. their left hands

Context: Learning disabilities are very common. They affect perhaps 10 percent of all children .Four times as many boys as girls have learning disabilities.
       Since about 1970, new research has helped brain scientists understand these problems better. Scientists now know there are many different kinds of learning disabilities and that they are caused by many different things. There is no longer any question that all learning disabilities result from differences in the way the brain is organized.
       You cannot look at a child and tell if he or she has a learning disability .There is no outward sign of the disorder .So some researchers began looking at the brain itself to learn what might be wrong.
       In one study ,researchers examined the brain of the learning-disabled person who had died in an accident .They found two unusual things. One has something to do with cells on the left side of the brain ,which control language. These cells normally are white .In the learning-disabled person, however ,these cells were gray. The researchers also found that many of the nerve cells were not in a line the way they should have been .The nerve cells were mixed together.
       The study was carried out under the guidance of Norman Geschwind, an early expert on learning disabilities. Doctor Geschwind thought that learning disabilities resulted mainly from problems on the left side of the brain .He believed this side of the brain failed to develop normally .Probably ,he said ,nerve cells there did not connect as they should .So the brain was like an electrical device in which the wires were crossed.
       Frank Duffy experimented with this technique at Children's Hospital Medical Center inprefix = st1 /Boston. Doctor Duffy found large differences in the brain activity of normal children and those with reading problems. The differences appeared throughout the brain. Doctor Duffy said his research proves that reading disabilities result from damage to a wide area of the brain, not just the left side. 
 Question:According to the passage we can conclude that further researches should be made to_. 
A. study possible influences on brain development and organization 
B. study how children learn to read and write ,and use numbers 
C. help learning-disabled children to develop their intelligence 
D. explore how the left side of the brain works in language learning

Context: Alzheimer's disease is a major national health problem. Nearly 2 million Americans over the age of 65 have Alzheimer's disease. It is a leading cause of death among the elderly. But Alzheimer's disease is not confined   to the aged. There may be a million or more people under the age of 65 suffering from the disease.
At one time, people suffering from the disease were said to be ""getting old"". The disease was thought to be a natural part of growing old, but it is now known that Alzheimer's disease strikes young and old alike. It is an organic   disease that destroys brain cells.
Alzheimer's disease affects the patient's memory, speech, and movement. In the beginning stages of the disease, the patient may seem slightly confused. He may have trouble speaking, then the patient's memory begins to fail. He may forget dates, numbers, names and plans.
As the disease progresses, the patient may not recognize family and friends. These symptoms  often cause terrible anxiety in the patient. He may feel lost and frightened. Sometimes the patient reacts with wild and bad behavior.
In the last stages of the disease, the patient may not be able to take care of himself. He may have lost the ability to speak and walk.
Scientists don't know exactly what causes Alzheimer's disease. It may be caused by a virus  .It may be caused by a poisonous substance  in the environment. At present, there is no cure for the disease. But there are ways to slow its progress. Exercise and physical treatment can help the patients of this disease. 
 Question:The main idea of the passage is that Alzheimer's disease   _  . 
A. is a terrible part of the aging process 
B. is an organic disease that affects young and old 
C. can be cured by physical treatment 
D. causes forgetfulness

Context: A single night of taking the drug Ecstasy   can cause serious brain damage and speed up the start of Parkinson's disease , scientists say. Just two or three Ecstasy tablets can permanently destroy brain cells that affect movement and reasoning, according to American research that links the drug to Parkinson's for the first time.
A study by a team at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, involving squirrel monkeys and baboons   found that both species suffered permanent damage to key cells, which are lost in Parkinson's, after receiving three low doses of Ecstasy at three-hour periods.
The study is particularly important because baboons are one of the best animal models for the human brain. George Ricaurte, who led the research, said that the widespread abuse of drug might have caused severe damage. ""The most troubling result is that young adults using Ecstasy may be increasing their risk of developing Parkinsonism as they get older.""
Alan Leshner, a former director of the US National Institute on Drug Abuse, said, ""This study emphasizes the multi-aspect damage that Ecstasy causes to users. We've long known that repeated use damages brain cells. But this study shows that even very occasional  use can have long-lasting effects on many different brain systems. It sends an important message to young people: don't experiment with your own brain.""
Janet Betts, a mother whose teenage daughter Leah died after a single Ecstasy tablet in 1995, said, ""This comes as no surprise. But people can't see the effects at first, and they say it won't happen to them. We'll see the symptoms later, just as we have with smoking."" 
 Question:The article is intended to   _  . 
A. explain the bad effects of drugs on people's health 
B. warn young people of the risk of taking the drug Ecstasy 
C. persuade people out of such bad habits as smoking and using drugs

Context: My friend Jennie gave her bone marrow(  )to a 50-year-old woman, a woman she has never met. 
At the end of March, the Red Cross called back. Six different blood elements were tested ; Jennie matched five completely and was about a 3/4 match of the six. So she was the best match. 
In April, Jennie went for a complete physical exam by one of the doctors who would perform the surgery. The doctor had to make sure that it would be no tread to her. The doctor told her that the surgery would need to have two quarts of bone marrow from her hip bones. Jennie would probably be released the same day the surgery took place and should expect to be painful for a couple of months. 
 ""I didn't think it was that big a deal until I realized I was a match,"" Jennie said. ""There was not a question in my head. It didn't seem like something that was going above and beyond. ""
Jennie was left with two very small scars on her lower back from the surgery and was giving medication to help reduce the pain. She still felt a great deal of pressure on her lower back. ""Being only 21, I felt like I am not old enough to significantly impact  someone's life,"" Jennie said. "" It seems strange to me that I could possibly save this woman's life which was being cut short by cancer. ""
Three weeks after the surgery, Jennie received a car from the Red Cross representative who told her the transplant was successful. ""I feel good, and I think it will actually work for her. "" She said, ""So many people say that they'd only donate if it was for a family member or close friend. This woman was someone's family and someone's friend. Obviously no one she knows is a match, and the fact that you'd be able to help a perfect stranger is greater. ""

A. a close friend 
B. a stranger 
C. a classmate

Context: The vitamins necessary for a healthy body are normally supplied by a good mixed diet, including a variety of fruits and green vegetables. It is only when people try to live on a very _ diet, say that when trying to lose weight, that it is necessary to make special provisions to supply the missing vitamins.
An example of the dangers of a restricted diet may be seen in the disease known as ""beri-beri"", which used to make large numbers of Eastern people who lived mainly on rice suffer. In the early years of last century, a Dutch scientist named Eijkman was trying to discover the cause of beri-beri. At first he thought it was transmitted by a germ   . He was working in a Japanese hospital, where the patients were fed on polished rice which had had the outer coverings removed from the grain, it was thought this would be easier for weak and sick people to digest.
Eijkman thought his germ theory was proved when he noticed the chickens in the hospital yard, which were fed on remains from the patients' plates, were also showing signs of the disease. He then tried to separate the germ, which he thought was causing the disease, but his experiments were interrupted by a hospital official, who ordered that the rice without coverings, even though left over by the patients, was too good for chickens. It should be recooked for the patients, and the chickens should be fed on cheap, rough rice with the outer coverings still on the grain.
Eijkman noticed that the chickens began to recover on the new diet. He began to consider the possibility that eating unmilled rice   somehow prevented or cured beri-beri--even that a lack of some ingredient   in the coverings may be the cause of the disease. Indeed this was the case. The element needed to prevent beri-beri was shortly afterwards separated from rice coverings and is now known as vitamin B. The milled rice, though more expensive, was in fact causing the disease the hospital was trying to cure. Nowadays, this terrible disease is much less common thanks to our knowledge of vitamins. 
 Question:What do we know about the disease beri-beri? 
A. It killed large numbers of people. 
B. It resulted from lack of vitamins. 
C. It was transmitted by milled rice. 
D. It was caused by diseased chickens. 
 Answer: B
Context: My mother fought cancer for almost a decade and died at 56. She held out long enough to meet the first of her grandchildren and to hold him in her arms. But my other children will never have the chance to know her and experience how loving and gracious she was.
We often speak of ""Mommy's mommy,"" and I find myself trying to explain the illness that took her away from us. They have asked if the same could happen to me. I have always told them not to worry, but the truth is that I carry a ""faulty"" gene, BRCA1, which sharply increases my risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian  cancer.
My doctors estimated that I had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman.
Once I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much as I could. I started with the breasts, as my risk of breast cancer is higher than my risk of ovarian cancer, and the surgery is more complex.
On April 27, I finished the three months of medical procedures. During that time I have been able to keep this private and to carry on with my work. But I am writing about it now because I hope that other women can benefit from my experience. Cancer is still a word that strikes fear into people's hearts, producing a deep sense of powerlessness. But today it is possible to find the way out through a blood test whether you are highly susceptible to breast and ovarian cancer, and then take action.
My own process began on February 2. The operation took eight hours. Then I woke up with tubes in my breasts. It did feel like a scene out of a science-fiction film. But days after surgery I can be back to a normal life. There have been many advances in this procedure in the last few years, and the results can be beautiful.
I wanted to write this to tell other women that the decision to have a surgery operation was not easy. But it is one I am very happy that I made. My chances of developing breast cancer have dropped from 87 percent to under 5 percent. I can tell my children that they don't need to fear they will lose me.
It is a comfort that they see nothing that makes them scared. They can see my small scars and that's it. Everything else is just Mommy, the same as she always was. And they know that I love them and I will do anything to be with them as long as I can. On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. 
For any woman reading this, I hope it helps you to know you have options. I want to encourage every woman, especially if you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, to seek out the information and medical experts who can help you through this aspect of your life, and to make your own informed choices.
I acknowledge that there are many wonderful holistic doctors working on alternatives to surgery. My own regimen  will be posted in due course on the Web site of the Pink Lotus Breast Center. I hope that this will be helpful to other women.
I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they can take measures.
Life comes with many challenges. The ones that should not scare us are the ones we can take on and take control of.

Context: Jack Andraka from Maryland won the grand prize at the 2012 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. It is the largest high school science competition in the world. The Maryland teenager is the youngest winner of the $75,000 prize. He was chosen from among 1,500 students in 70 countries.
Jack Andraka invented a test for pancreatic cancer  . He started to learn it after losing a close family friend to the disease. ""I went on the Internet and I found that 85%of all pancreatic cancers are found late, when someone has less than 2% chance of survival , "" he says, ""and I was thinking,' That's not right. We should be able to do something.'"" He found that early discovery is important to increasing the chances of surviving the disease.
The Maryland teenager asked to work in a laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and was allowed. There he developed a simple paper test, which can recognize the disease in a single drop of blood. His test has proved correct 90% of the time. It also is 100 times more sensitive than other tests. ""It costs 3 cents per test, and then it takes only 5 minutes to run,"" he said.
Jack's success wouldn't have been possible without Anirban Maitra, a professor at Johns Hopkins. He was the only person among the 200 researchers Jack wrote to who showed interest in his project. ""I was very surprised that this was a 15-year-old who was writing this. I wanted to meet this clever young man and see what he wanted to talk about and so I called him over for an interview . ""
Jack worked in Professor Maitra's laboratory, completing his project in 7 months. The government has given the Maryland teenager patent rights to the pancreatic cancer test. He is now talking with companies about developing the test into a simple product.
Whatever happens, the professor believes Jack Andraka's name is one we will be hearing again over the next 10 to 20 years.

Context: The vitamins necessary for a healthy body are normally supplied by a good mixed diet, including a variety of fruits and green vegetables. It is only when people try to live on a very _ diet, say that when trying to lose weight, that it is necessary to make special provisions to supply the missing vitamins.
An example of the dangers of a restricted diet may be seen in the disease known as ""beri-beri"", which used to make large numbers of Eastern people who lived mainly on rice suffer. In the early years of last century, a Dutch scientist named Eijkman was trying to discover the cause of beri-beri. At first he thought it was transmitted by a germ   . He was working in a Japanese hospital, where the patients were fed on polished rice which had had the outer coverings removed from the grain, it was thought this would be easier for weak and sick people to digest.
Eijkman thought his germ theory was proved when he noticed the chickens in the hospital yard, which were fed on remains from the patients' plates, were also showing signs of the disease. He then tried to separate the germ, which he thought was causing the disease, but his experiments were interrupted by a hospital official, who ordered that the rice without coverings, even though left over by the patients, was too good for chickens. It should be recooked for the patients, and the chickens should be fed on cheap, rough rice with the outer coverings still on the grain.
Eijkman noticed that the chickens began to recover on the new diet. He began to consider the possibility that eating unmilled rice   somehow prevented or cured beri-beri--even that a lack of some ingredient   in the coverings may be the cause of the disease. Indeed this was the case. The element needed to prevent beri-beri was shortly afterwards separated from rice coverings and is now known as vitamin B. The milled rice, though more expensive, was in fact causing the disease the hospital was trying to cure. Nowadays, this terrible disease is much less common thanks to our knowledge of vitamins. 
 Question:What do we know about the disease beri-beri? 
A. It killed large numbers of people. 
B. It resulted from lack of vitamins. 
C. It was transmitted by milled rice. 
D. It was caused by diseased chickens. 
 Answer: B
Context: Not all think laughter is the best medicine, but it seems to help.So scientists carried on a new study of diabetes   patients who were given a good dose of humor for a year to prove it.
Researchers divide 20 high-risk diabetic patients into two groups.Both groups were given standard diabetes medicine.Group L viewed 30 minutes of humor of their choice, while Group C, the control group, did not.This went on for a year of treatments.
By two months into the study, the patients in the laughter group had lower level of the hormones epinephrine  , considered to cause stress, which is known to be deadly.After the 12 months, _ rises 26 percent in Group L but only 3 percent in Group C.In another measure, C-reactive proteins, a maker of heart disease, drop 66 percent in the laughter group but only 26 percent in the control group.
""The best doctors believe that there is a physical good brought about by the positive emotion, happy laughter,"" said study leader Lee Berk of Loma Linda University.And other research has found that humor makes us more hopeful.Still, more study is needed, Berk said.The research by Berk found that humor can bring about similar changes in body chemistry, which was proved in the new study.The research result will be presented this month at the meeting in the US.Research at the University of Maryland School of Medicine shows that laughter causes the inner lining of blood vessels to expand, increasing blood flow in a way thought to be healthy.
""Lifestyle choices have an important effect on health and these are choices which we and patients should pay attention to, rather than prevention and treatment,"" Berk said in a statement this week. 
 Question:Why did the scientists carry on the new research? 
A. To find out if laughter was good to health. 
B. To discover the best medicine to cure diabetes. 
C. Because the number of diabetic patients is the largest in the world. 
D. Because diabetic patients need more laughter than other patients.

Context: Good Genes Mean Long Life
Scientists have discovered that living to the age of 100 may have nothing to do with the lifestyle you lead and everything to do with the type of genes you have.
For the lucky carriers of ""Methuselah"" genes, worries over smoking, eating unhealthily and not getting enough exercise may not be as necessary as to those of us without the special gene pattern  .
The ""Methuselah"" genes could give extra protection against the diseases of old age such as cancer and heart disease. They could also protect people against the effects of the unhealthy lifestyles that we believe will lead us to an early death, scientists say. However, the genes are very rare.
The genes include ADIPOQ, which is found in about 10 percent of young people but in nearly 30 percent of people living past 100. They also include the CETP and the ApoC3 genes, which are found in 10 percent of young people, but in about 20 percent of people over 100 years old.
Some of those genes were discovered by a research group at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, led by Professor Nir Barzilai. The team studied the genes of over 500 people over 100 years old, and their children.
The studies show that tiny mutations   in the make-up of some genes can greatly increase a person's lifespan  . Barzilai told a Royal Society conference that the discovery of such genes gave scientists clear targets for developing drugs that could prevent age-related diseases, allow people to live longer and stay healthy.
David Gems, a researcher at University College London, believes that drugs to slow ageing will become widespread.
""If we know which genes control longevity   then we can ... target them with drugs. That makes it possible to slow down ageing,"" he told The Times.
""Much of the pain and suffering in the world are caused by ageing. If we can find a way to reduce that, then we are obliged   to take it."" 
 Question:According to the article, the ApoC3 gene is found in   _   of people over 100 years old. 
A. 10% 
B. 20% 
C. 30% 
D. 50%

Context: There are various reasons why cancers appear to be on the increase. For one thing, though their sufferers are to be found in all age groups, cancers are particularly likely to attack persons in their middle and advanced years. Naturally, since people live longer these years, there are more cancer sufferers than before. Again, with better methods of diagnosis  , doctors can more easily recognize cancerous growths that would formerly have passed unnoticed or that would have been wrongly diagnosed. It is also believed that certain habits and conditions of modern living, including heavy smoking and the pollution of the air, may leave people living in more cancer-causing conditions than before.
We all look forward to the day when a simple medical test can find cancer while it is still small. Researchers around the world are working on _ . Most of their work deals with the examination of the blood.
Researchers in Boston have found something in the blood of cancer patients that does not appear in healthy persons. The test showed which persons had cancer and which did not. It was correct more than 90 percent of the time.
The researchers believe the test may be able to show cancer very clearly in its development. Cancers discovered early usually can be treated successfully.
The test examines very small bits of fat in the blood called lipids  . Cancers seem to change lipids although doctors do not know why. The test showed differences between the lipids of the persons with cancer and the lipids of those without cancer.
The researchers say the new test could be a step to develop a simple way to check patients for cancer before the disease shows on an X-ray. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. A simple way to cancer 
B. Cancers can be cured 
C. How to find cancer 
D. Early discovery of cancer 
 Answer: D
Context: My mother fought cancer for almost a decade and died at 56. She held out long enough to meet the first of her grandchildren and to hold him in her arms. But my other children will never have the chance to know her and experience how loving and gracious she was.
We often speak of ""Mommy's mommy,"" and I find myself trying to explain the illness that took her away from us. They have asked if the same could happen to me. I have always told them not to worry, but the truth is that I carry a ""faulty"" gene, BRCA1, which sharply increases my risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian  cancer.
My doctors estimated that I had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman.
Once I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much as I could. I started with the breasts, as my risk of breast cancer is higher than my risk of ovarian cancer, and the surgery is more complex.
On April 27, I finished the three months of medical procedures. During that time I have been able to keep this private and to carry on with my work. But I am writing about it now because I hope that other women can benefit from my experience. Cancer is still a word that strikes fear into people's hearts, producing a deep sense of powerlessness. But today it is possible to find the way out through a blood test whether you are highly susceptible to breast and ovarian cancer, and then take action.
My own process began on February 2. The operation took eight hours. Then I woke up with tubes in my breasts. It did feel like a scene out of a science-fiction film. But days after surgery I can be back to a normal life. There have been many advances in this procedure in the last few years, and the results can be beautiful.
I wanted to write this to tell other women that the decision to have a surgery operation was not easy. But it is one I am very happy that I made. My chances of developing breast cancer have dropped from 87 percent to under 5 percent. I can tell my children that they don't need to fear they will lose me.
It is a comfort that they see nothing that makes them scared. They can see my small scars and that's it. Everything else is just Mommy, the same as she always was. And they know that I love them and I will do anything to be with them as long as I can. On a personal note, I do not feel any less of a woman. 
For any woman reading this, I hope it helps you to know you have options. I want to encourage every woman, especially if you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, to seek out the information and medical experts who can help you through this aspect of your life, and to make your own informed choices.
I acknowledge that there are many wonderful holistic doctors working on alternatives to surgery. My own regimen  will be posted in due course on the Web site of the Pink Lotus Breast Center. I hope that this will be helpful to other women.
I choose not to keep my story private because there are many women who do not know that they might be living under the shadow of cancer. It is my hope that they, too, will be able to get gene tested, and that if they have a high risk they, too, will know that they can take measures.
Life comes with many challenges. The ones that should not scare us are the ones we can take on and take control of.

 Answer: C
Context: The relationship between exercise and cancer has long both intrigued and puzzled oncologists and exercise physiologists.
Exercise is strongly associated with lowered risks for many types of cancer. At the same time, exercise involves biological stress, which typically leads to a short-term increase in inflammation  which can contribute to higher risks for many cancers.
Now, a new study in mice may offer some clues into the exercise-cancer paradox. It suggests that exercise may change how the immune system deals with cancer by boosting adrenaline , certain immune cells and other chemicals that, together, can reduce the severity of cancer or fight it off altogether.
To try to better understand how exercise can both elevate inflammation and simultaneously protect the body against cancer, scientists at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and other institutions decided to closely examine what happens inside mice at high risk for the disease.
So, for the new study, they began by gathering a group of adult lab mice. These animals generally like to run.
The scientists then implanted melanoma   skin cancer cells into the mice before providing half of them with running wheels in their cages while the other animals remained sedentary. After four weeks, far fewer of the runners had developed full-blown melanoma than the sedentary mice and those that had been diagnosed with the disease showed fewer and smaller lesions.
They drew blood from both the exercising and sedentary animals and cells from any tumors in both groups. As expected, they found much higher levels of the hormone adrenaline in the blood of the exercising animals, especially right after they had been working out on the wheels but also at other times of the day. The body releases adrenaline in response to almost any type of stressful experience, including exercise.
They also found higher levels of interleukin-6 in the blood of the runners. This is a substance that is released by working muscles and is believed to both increase and decrease inflammation in the body, depending on where and how it goes to work.
Perhaps most important, they found much higher numbers in the bloodstreams of runners than in the sedentary mice of a type of immune cell named natural killer cells that are known to be strong cancer fighters.
So the scientists repeated their original experiment multiple times, inducing cancer while allowing some mice to run and others to sit. In some of these follow-up experiments, the scientists injected the runners with a substance that blocked the production of adrenaline and gave sedentary animals large doses of added adrenaline.
What they now found was that when running mice could not produce adrenaline, they developed cancer at the same rate as the sedentary animals, while the sedentary animals that had been injected with extra adrenaline fought off their tumors better than other sitting mice.
More remarkably, the scientists determined that adrenaline seemed to be sending biochemical signals to some of the animals' IL-6 cells, making them physiologically more alert, so that when a tumor began to develop in the affected animal, those IL-6 cells in turn activated the natural killer cells in the bloodstream and actually directed them to the tumors, like minute guide fish.
With these results, ""we show that voluntary wheel running in mice can reduce the growth of tumors, and we have identified an exercise-dependent mobilization of natural killer cells as the underlying cause of this protection,"" said Pernille Hojman, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen who oversaw the new study. It perhaps provides one more incentive for us to get up and move. 
 Question:In the first experiment, which one is the most important result the scientists found? 
A. Natural killer cells are much more in the bloodstreams of runners than in the sedentary mice. 
B. Levels of interleukin-6 are higher in the blood of the runners than in the sedentary mice. 
C. Exercise such as running seemed to help the mice fight against the cancer. 
D. Adrenaline can reduce the severity of cancer or fight it off.

Context: When John Weston awoke that morning, he remembered that his mother was going into hospital. He hadn't worked out quite what was wrong with her. He knew, though that she hadn't been well for some time now, and it had become almost familiar to him to see her eyes narrowed in a sudden attack of pain, and her hand pressing against her heart. Their own doctor, who she had finally gone to for advice, had sent her to an expert who knew all about these things. He had told her that just as soon as there was a bed for her, she would have to come into his hospital where he could look after her himself.
During the weeks since then the pains had come even more frequently, and the narrowed eyes became an almost permanent part of her expression. Always rather sharp, she began losing her temper over little things so that John's father kept his thoughts to himself more and more. John, as ready as possible to make allowances, tried to think what it would be like to have toothache all the time and how bad-tempered that would make you.
So his mother would go into hospital for a few days. He was going to stay with his Aunt Daisy till she came back, and his father would stay on at home by himself. John's cousin, Mona, was to come in and make the bed and wash the pots and dust round now and again. That was the arrangement, and John didn't care much for it. Apart from missing his mother(and he was glad she was going away because they would make her better), he wasn't very fond of his Aunt Daisy because she was even more bad-tempered than his mother.

Context: Nuclear power's  danger to health, safety, and even life itself can be described in one word; radiation . Nuclear radiation has a certain mystery about it, partly because it cannot be detected   by human senses. It can't be seen or heard, or touched or tasted, even though it may be all around us. There are other things like that. For example, radio waves are all around us but we can't detect them, sense them, without a radio receiver. Similarly, we can't sense radioactivity without a radiation detector. But unlike common radio waves, nuclear radiation is not harmless to human beings and other living things. At very high levels, radiation can kill an animal or human being completely by killing masses of cells   in important organs  . But even the lowest levels can do serious damage. There is no level of radiation that is completely safe. If the radiation does not hit anything important, the damage may not be significant. This is the case when only a few cells are hit, and if they are killed completely. Your body will replace the dead cells with healthy ones. But if the few cells are only damaged, and if they reproduce themselves, you may be in trouble. They reproduce themselves in an unusual way. They can grow into cancer. Sometimes this does not show up for many years.
This is another reason for some of the mystery about nuclear radiation. Serious damage can be done without the knowledge of the person at the time that damage has occurred. A person can be irradiated  and feel fine, then die of cancer five, ten, or twenty years later as a result. Or a child can be born weak or easy to get serious illness as a result of radiation absorbed by its grandparents. Radiation can hurt us. We must know the truth. 
 Question:Radiation can hurt us in the way that it can   _  . 
A. kill large numbers of cells in main organs so as to cause death immediately 
B. damage cells which may grow into cancer years later 
C. affect the healthy growth of our younger generation 
D. lead to all of the above results

It is only when people try to live on a very _ diet, say that when trying to lose weight, that it is necessary to make special provisions to supply the missing vitamins.
An example of the dangers of a restricted diet may be seen in the disease known as ""beri-beri"", which used to make large numbers of Eastern people who lived mainly on rice suffer. In the early years of last century, a Dutch scientist named Eijkman was trying to discover the cause of beri-beri. At first he thought it was transmitted by a germ   . He was working in a Japanese hospital, where the patients were fed on polished rice which had had the outer coverings removed from the grain, it was thought this would be easier for weak and sick people to digest.
Eijkman thought his germ theory was proved when he noticed the chickens in the hospital yard, which were fed on remains from the patients' plates, were also showing signs of the disease. He then tried to separate the germ, which he thought was causing the disease, but his experiments were interrupted by a hospital official, who ordered that the rice without coverings, even though left over by the patients, was too good for chickens. It should be recooked for the patients, and the chickens should be fed on cheap, rough rice with the outer coverings still on the grain.
Eijkman noticed that the chickens began to recover on the new diet. He began to consider the possibility that eating unmilled rice   somehow prevented or cured beri-beri--even that a lack of some ingredient   in the coverings may be the cause of the disease. Indeed this was the case. The element needed to prevent beri-beri was shortly afterwards separated from rice coverings and is now known as vitamin B.

Context: Germs are everywhere. You can't see them, but they are on your desk, on your computer, and even in the air!
Like people, germs move around the world. They fly with us on planes. When food, clothes, and other things travel around the world, germs travel, too. Some germs are safe, but some are dangerous. Germs cause illnesses like colds and the flu. 
Warmer Weather Brings Germs
The world's weather is changing. Cooler countries are getting warmer, so insects from hot countries can move  _ . Some of these insects, like mosquitoes, carry dangerous germs. These germs cause headaches, fever, and can even kill people.
Under Your Skin
Your skin protects you from germs. It stops some germs, but not all. They can enter your body when you eat, or when you have a cut. Germs are on your hands, too. They enter your body when you touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. 
Fighting Germs 
Your immune system  protects you, too. When germs get inside your body, your immune system finds and kills them. Special cells move around your body and fight germs. They help you stay healthy. Other cells make antibodies. Antibodies help your body find and stop germs. 
What can you do to fight germs? You should wash your hands with soap and water. Soap kills many germs, and water washes them away. 
 Question:Which of the following is right according to the text? 
A. All germs are dangerous. 
B. There are more germs in cold places. 
C. Soap can kill all germs. 
D. Germs can get into your body.

Context: Do you know you could get sick just by walking past a building? The bacteria  that cause Legionnaire's disease grow very fast in large modern buildings. They are carried by air through the buildings and outside. Legionnaire s disease is only one of the illnesses that are caused by ""sick buildings"".
Some buildings can make you ill because their heating and air-conditioning  are controlled . Air from outside cannot get in through the closed windows; This indoor air pollution is a growing problem.
Legionnaire's disease may be the most serious result of sick buildings, but other unpleasant illnesses can appear.People who work in some buildings suffer  from tiredness, feeling sick and headaches. Their offices look bright and clean, but invisible  and dangerous bacteria are in the air around them.
There is an answer to the problem. The air-conditioning and heating can be tested for bacteria. _ This is expensive to do, but the results are good. The people in the buildings no longer get sick, and everybody is happier. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE? 
A. Legionnaire's disease is only one of the results of ""sick buildings"". 
B. There is less and less indoor air pollution. 
C. The bacteria are not dangerous if the offices look bright and clean. 
D. If the tests for bacteria are expensive. the results are good. .

Context: A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations.
Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital.
Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. ""We were desperate,"" said Matouk.
The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. ""We are very satisfied with the results,"" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital.
Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians in transplant surgery at the Royal Liverpool. ""Funding is a problem,"" said Hammad. ""In the meantime we'll go back as volunteers to Gaza for the next couple of years to do more transplants."" The Liverpool team's next visit is scheduled for May. 
 Question:What is the beginning of the cooperation between the Royal Liverpool hospital and Gaza? 
A. A UK doctor contacted Gaza hospital. 
B. The Shifa imported medical machines from UK. 
C. Ziad Matouk's condition seemed to get worse. 
D. A Shifa doctor turned to Royal Liverpool hospital for help.

Context: Jack Andraka from Maryland won the grand prize at the 2012 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. It is the largest high school science competition in the world. The Maryland teenager is the youngest winner of the $75,000 prize. He was chosen from among 1,500 students in 70 countries.
Jack Andraka invented a test for pancreatic cancer  . He started to learn it after losing a close family friend to the disease. ""I went on the Internet and I found that 85%of all pancreatic cancers are found late, when someone has less than 2% chance of survival , "" he says, ""and I was thinking,' That's not right. We should be able to do something.'"" He found that early discovery is important to increasing the chances of surviving the disease.
The Maryland teenager asked to work in a laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and was allowed. There he developed a simple paper test, which can recognize the disease in a single drop of blood. His test has proved correct 90% of the time. It also is 100 times more sensitive than other tests. ""It costs 3 cents per test, and then it takes only 5 minutes to run,"" he said.
Jack's success wouldn't have been possible without Anirban Maitra, a professor at Johns Hopkins. He was the only person among the 200 researchers Jack wrote to who showed interest in his project. ""I was very surprised that this was a 15-year-old who was writing this. I wanted to meet this clever young man and see what he wanted to talk about and so I called him over for an interview . ""
Jack worked in Professor Maitra's laboratory, completing his project in 7 months. The government has given the Maryland teenager patent rights to the pancreatic cancer test. He is now talking with companies about developing the test into a simple product.
Whatever happens, the professor believes Jack Andraka's name is one we will be hearing again over the next 10 to 20 years.

Context: Medical drugs sometimes cause more damage than they cure. One solution to this problem is to put the drugs inside a capsule, protecting them from the body--and the body from them--until they can be released at just the right spot. There are lots of ways to trigger   this release, including changing temperature, acidity, and so on. But triggers can come with their own risks--burns, for example. Now, researchers in California have designed what could be a harmless trigger to date: shining near-infrared light (NIR, ) on the drug in the capsule.
The idea of using light to liberate the drug in the capsule isn't new. Researchers around the globe have developed polymers   and other materials that begin to break down when they absorb either ultraviolet (UV, ) or visible light. But tissues also readily absorb UV and visible light, which means the drug release can be triggered only near the skin, where the light can reach the capsule. NIR light largely passes through tissues, so researchers have tried to use it as a trigger. But few compounds   absorb NIR well and go through chemical changes.
That changed last year when Adah Almutairi, a chemist at the University of California, San Diego, reported that she and her colleagues had designed a polymer that breaks down when it absorbs NIR light. Their polymer used a commercially available NIR-absorbing group called o-nitrobenzyl (ONB). When they catch the light, ONB groups fall off the polymer, leading to its breakdown. But ONB is only a so-so NIR absorber, and it could be poisonous to cells when it separates from the polymer.
So Almutairi and her colleagues reported creating a new material for capsules that's even better.This one consists of a long chain of compounds called cresol groups linked in a polymer. Cresol contains reactive  components that make it highly unstable in its polymeric form, a feature Almutairi and her colleagues use to their advantage. After polymerizing the cresols, they cap each reactive component with a light-absorbing compound called Bhc. When the Bhcs absorb NIR light, the reactive groups are exposed and break the long polymer into two short chains. Shining additional light continues this breakdown, potentially releasing any drugs in the capsule. What's more, Almutairi says, Bhc is 10 times better at absorbing NIR than is ONB and is not poisonous to cells. 
 Question:Which word can be used to complete the following process of changes? 
A. protected 
B. formed 
C. exposed 
D. combined 
 Answer: C
Context: Scientists say they have discovered a promising treatment for sleeping sickness, a killer disease that infects  about 60,000 people in Africa a year.
British and Canadian experts say drugs could attack the parasite  causing the illness needs to survive. They say the drug could be ready for human medical test in about 18 months.
The disease, spread by the bite of a fly, is caused by a parasite attacking the central nervous system. It has similar symptoms  to malaria , making it difficult to diagnose. Left untreated, it moves to the brain, resulting in mental confusion and final death
The ""breakthrough"" came at the University of Dundee in Scotland, where scientists were offered money to research diseases ignored by major drugs companies.
Professor Paul Wyatt, director of the programme, said: ""This is one of the most significant findings made in recent years in terms of drug discovery and development for ignored diseases.""
He said the research, published in the journal Nature, represented ""significant progress"" in the development of a full blown drug against the disease.
The World Health Organization said there are between 50,000 and 70,000 cases of the disease a year, with a further 60 million people at risk of infection.
The research in Dundee was _ by partners at the University of York in England and the Structural Genomics Consortium in Toronto, Canada. The two drugs currently available to treat sleeping sickness both have problems. One is with side effects that kill one in 20 patients and the other is costly, only partially effective and requires long-time hospital treatment, the scientists said. 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that  _   . 
A. big drug companies play an important role in the research of the new drug 
B. people who get infected with the disease are mentally disturbed 
C. among 200 people infected with the disease, 5 may die because of the old drug 
D. Professor Paul Wyatt may be a professor at the University of York

Context: Tu Youyou, 84, honored with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Oct 5, 2015. She was the first Chinese citizen to win a Nobel Prize in science for her work in helping to create an anti-malaria  medicine.
In 1967, Communist leader Mao Zedong decided there was an urgent national need to find a cure for malaria. At the time, malaria spread by mosquitoes was killing Chinese soldiers fighting Americans in the jungles of northern Vietnam. A secret research unit was formed to find a cure for the illness. Two years later, Tu Youyou was instructed to become the new head of Mission 523. Researchers in Mission523 _ ancient books to find historical methods of fighting malaria. When she started her search for an anti-malarial drug, over 240,000 compounds  around the world had already been tested, without any success.
Finally, the team found a brief reference to one substance, sweet wormwood , which had been used to treat malaria in China around 400 AD. The team isolated one active compound in wormwood, artemisinin , which appeared to battle malaria-friendly parasites . The team then tested extracts  of the compound but nothing was effective until Tu Youyou returned to the original ancient text. After another careful reading, she improved the drug recipe one final time, heating the extract without allowing it to reach boiling point.
After the drug showed promising results in mice and monkeys, Tu volunteered to be the first human recipient of the new drug. ""As the head of the research group, I had the responsibility."" she explained. 
 Question:Which of the following words can best describe Tu Youyou? 
A. Responsible 
B. Traditional 
C. Stubborn 
D. Lucky

Context: Since ancient times, people have known about its ability to reduce pain and high body temperature. More than 2000 years ago, the Greek doctor Hippocrates advised his patients to chew on the bark and leaves of the willow.
The tree contains a chemical called salicin . From salicin, researchers in the 1800s discovered how to make salicylic acid . And in 1897, a chemist named Felix Hoffmann at Friedrich Bayer and Company in Germany created acetyl salicylic acid. Later it became the active substance in a new medicine that Bayer called aspirin. The ""a"" came from acetyl. The ""spir"" came from the spirea plant, which also produces salicin. And the ""in"" Well, that is a common way to end medicine names.
In 1982, a British scientist shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in part for discovering how aspirin works. Sir John Vane found that aspirin blocks the body from making natural substances called prostaglandins .Prostaglandins have several effects on the body. Some cause pain and the expansion, or swelling( ; ), of damaged tissue. Others protect the lining of the stomach and small intestine. Prostaglandins also make the heart, kidneys and blood vessels  work well. But there is a problem. Aspirin works against all prostaglandins, good and bad. Scientists learned how aspirin interferes with an enzyme . One form of this enzyme makes the prostaglandin that causes pain and swelling. Another form of the enzyme creates a protective effect. So aspirin can reduce pain and swelling in damaged tissues. But it can also harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine . 
 Question:What can we know about aspirin according to the passage? 
A. Aspirin can treat almost diseases. 
B. Aspirin can create the protective enzyme. 
C. Aspirin can harm the inside of the stomach and small intestine. 
D. Aspirin can protect the inside of the stomach and small intestine.

Context: Many people have never heard of Mesothelioma and are unaware of its symptoms. Although considered a rare form of cancer, each year the number of cases grows. With the prevalence of this disease on the rise, it is critical to understand why and how Mesothelioma develops and what courses of action can be taken in the event of diagnosis. The following is a list of frequently asked questions and answers that will provide you with some information on Mesothelioma, and the legal issues surrounding it.
What is Mesothelioma?
Mesothelioma is the term used to describe a cancerous tumor found in the mesothelial cells of an organ. The organs where this form of cancer is most commonly found are the lungs, heart and abdominal organs. Pleural Mesothelioma is cancer of the lung lining(,)and is the most common form of Mesothelioma.
What causes Mesothelioma?
Mesothelioma is almost always caused by exposure to asbestos . Asbestos is often found in building materials used before the mid 1970's. In addition, materials such as pipes, boiler insulation, floor, ceiling and roof tiles may contain asbestos.
How much asbestos exposure will cause Mesothelioma?
Generally, the probability of developing this form of cancer is in accordance with the length of time you are exposed to asbestos. Also, your health is at risk if your exposure to asbestos is intense. It should be noted that Mesothelioma has a latency period of 20 to 50 years. This means that you may develop the disease long after your exposure to asbestos. On average, people tend to develop Mesothelioma somewhere between 35 and 40 years after exposure.
How quickly does Mesothelioma progress?
The onset of Mesothelioma is quite slow. Patients will begin to experience symptoms such as lower back pain and chest pain. These symptoms may also be accompanied by weight loss, fever and difficulty breathing. Unfortunately, once Mesothelioma develops, it quickly becomes aggressive and treatment must be sought immediately.
Can Mesothelioma be treated?
Doctors are able to use several traditional methods of cancer treatment for Mesothelioma, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiation. Like all forms of cancer, detecting the disease at the earliest stage possible greatly increases the patient's chances for survival. If you have worked in an industry such as construction or suspect that you may have been exposed to asbestos, be alert for symptoms and contact your doctor immediately.
What legal courses of action can be taken?
Anyone suffering from Mesothelioma is entitled to compensation from asbestos manufacturers. Additionally, if you are the spouse or child of someone who has died from Mesothelioma, you are entitled to file a claim and seek compensation. 
 Question:Which of the following would be the best title for the text? 
A. Terrible Mesothelioma 
B. Mesothelioma is around us 
C. Frequently Asked Questions About Mesothelioma 
D. Mesothelioma in on the rise
