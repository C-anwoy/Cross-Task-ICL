Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair.

He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.

 Answer: C
Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT."" 
 Question:The price of the knives was cut down by half because   _  . 
A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap 
D. the knives were produced in one factory 
 Answer: B
Context: Supply and demand is perhaps one of the most basic concepts of economics and it is the backbone of a market economy. Demand refers to how much of a product or service is desired by buyers. The quantity demanded is the amount of a product people are willing to buy at a certain price; the relationship between price and quantity demanded is known as the demand relationship. Supply represents how much the market can offer. The quantity supplied refers to the amount of a certain goods producers are willing to supply when receiving a certain price. The relationship between price and how much of a goods or service is supplied to the market is known as the supply relationship. Price, therefore, is a reflection of supply and demand.
   The law of demand states that, if all other factors remain equal, the higher the price of a product, the fewer people will demand that product. The amount of goods that buyers purchase at a higher price is less as the price of a product goes up, so does the opportunity cost of buying that product.
   Like the law of demand, the law of supply shows the quantities that will be sold at a certain price. But unlike the law of demand, the supply relationship shows an upward slope. This means that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. Producers supply more at a higher price because selling a higher quantity at a higher price increases the whole income.
   Now that we know the laws of supply and demand, let's turn to an example to show how supply and demand affect price.
   Imagine that a CD of your favorite band is sold for $20. Because the record company's previous analysis showed that consumers will not demand CDs at a price higher than $20, only ten CDs were sold because the opportunity cost is too high for suppliers to produce more. If, however, the ten CDs are demanded by 20 people, the price will then rise. As a result, the rise in price should cause more CDs to be supplied as the supply relationship shows that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. If, however, there are 30 CDs produced and demand is still at 20, the price will not be pushed up because the supply is more than the demand. 
 Question:We know from the passage that changes in the prices of product cause changes in   _  . 
A. income and expense 
B. invention and production 
C. market and society 
D. supply and demand

Context: Eighth-grader Victoria Bills is talking about money with her classmates. She is worried that a company's stock   price could fall. It may be an unusual topic of conversation for a 13-year-old. But at Bills' school in Chicago, US, you hear it all the time.
The Chicago school's 420 students learn about economic . They also get a chance to make money. Each 1stgrade and 5thgrade, students learn the basics of economics and investing .
Then in 6thgrade, they put what they've learned to work. Students join a junior group that manages the $20,000. The group, made up of 12 to 14 students, decides which stocks to buy.
After graduating, students pass on $20,000 to the next 1stgrade class. They keep half of the rest of the money; the other half goes toward improving the school. They can choose to put their money in a college-savings program or take the cash.
In 2007, Bills suggested that her class buy the stock of the Apple computer company. This was just before the iPhone came out. ""We bought stock just at the right time,"" she says. The kids bought Google stock as it reached $400 a share. It is now worth over $500. ""It was a good buy,"" says Myles Gate, 13. He hopes to be a banker one day.
The school's two graduating classes of 2005 and 2006 have each earned about $10,000 in profits .

Context: In business, there's a speed difference: It's the difference between how important a firm's leaders say speed is to their competitive  strategy  and how fast the company actually moves.The difference is important regardless of industry and company size. Companies fearful of losing their competitive advantage spend much time and money looking for ways to pick up the speed.
In our study of 343 businesses, the companies that chose to go, go, go to try to _ ended up with lower sales and operating incomes than those that paused at key moments to make sure they were on the right track.What's more, the firms that ""slowed down to speed up"" improved their top and bottom lines, averaging 40% higher sales and 52% higher operating incomes over a three-year period.
How did they disobey the laws of business physics, taking more time than competitors yet performing better? They thought differently about what ""slower"" and ""faster"" mean.Firms sometimes fail to understand the difference between operational speed (moving quickly) and strategic speed (reducing the time it takes to deliver value).Simply increasing the speed of production, for example, may be one way to try to reduce the speed difference.But that often leads to reduced value over time, in the form of lower-quality products and services.
In our study, higher-performing companies with strategic speed always made changes when necessary. They became more open to ideas and discussion.They encouraged new ways of thinking.And they allowed time to look back and learn.By contrast  , performance suffered at firms that moved fast all the time, paid too much attention to improving efficiency, stuck to tested methods, didn't develop team spirit among their employees, and had little time thinking
about changes.
Strategic speed serves as a kind of leadership.Teams that regularly take time to get things right, rather than plough ahead full bore, are more successful in meeting their business goals.That kind of strategy must come from the top. 
 Question:Which could be the best title for the text? 
A. Improve quality? Serve better. 
B. Deliver value? Plough ahead. 
C. Reduce time? Move faster. 
D. Need speed? Slow down.

Context: Decreasing grain prices along with growing costs of production means Chinese farmers are unlikely to see a significant rise in income next year. [:ZXXK]
China's economic planning chief Ma Kai expressed the concern as the government undertakes an ambitious program to improve rural people's lives.
Grain prices have been dropping since April; and prices of wheat, corn and rice fell 5 per cent from August to October compared with the same period last year, Ma, minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, told an annual meeting on development and reform held over the weekend.
Meanwhile, prices of production materials rose 9.1 per cent year on year during the first 10 months.
The situation makes it difficult to achieve a ""new socialist countryside,"" which was last week highlighted as a new concept and ""common action"" of the whole Party and nation.
Vice-Minister of Agriculture Yin Chengjie also said China's entry to the World Trade Organization also creates _ for income rises for the country's 780 million farmers.
Farmers' income is expected to increase by 5 per cent this year, hitting the target set by the central government at the beginning of this year.
Last year, per capita net income of Chinese farmers reached 2,936 yuan (US$362), up 6.8 per cent year on year, and the highest increase since 1997.
Ma also said China would continue to seek fast, steady economic growth in 2012 but more efforts will be made to deal with the challenges brought about by overheating in some industrial sectors  .

Context: Switzerland is the best place to be born in the world in 2013,and the US is just 16th. A new study made by the Economist Intelligence Unit says American babies will have a dimmer future than those born in Hong Kong,Ireland and even Canada. The EIU,a sister company of The Economist,tried to measure how well countries will provide the best opportunities for a healthy,safe and prosperous life in years to come.
People born in Switzerland will tend to be the happiest and have the best quality of life in terms of wealth,health and trust in public institutions,according to the analysis. The Scandinavian countries of Norway,Sweden and Denmark also all make the top five in a'quality-of-lif e'index where it is best to be born next year.
One of the most important factors is being rich,but other factors come into play including crime,trust in public institutions and the health of family life. In total,the index takes into account 11 factors. These include fixed factors such as geography,others that change slowly over time such as demography   social and cultural characteristics, and the state of the world economy. The index also looks at income per head in 2030,which is roughly when children born in 2013 will reach adulthood. Small economies take up the top 10 countries,with Australia coming second and New Zealand and the Netherlands not too far behind.
Half of the top 10 countries are European,but only one,the Netherlands,is from the eurozone. The crisis-ridden south of Europe,including Greece,Portugal and Spain,falls behind despite the advantage of a favourable climate. Interestingly,the largest European economies-Germany,France and Britain-do not do particularly well. Nigeria has the unenviable title of being the worst country for a baby to enter the world in 2013.

Context: BC Social Report, August 14, 2010
Scandinavians may spend a lot of the winter in darkness but they are the happiest people in Europe, according to a study showed this month. Countries like Denmark and Finland scored highest on the study of happiness in Europe carried out by Cambridge University, which also found that the sunny southern countries of Italy, Portugal and Greece got the least joy out of  life.
The survey entitled:  ""No Man is an Island"" showed that countries where people enjoy time with friends and family, have trust in government and national institutions were more likely to be happy than those living in a sunny climate. The study rated respondent on their overall sense of happiness and life satisfaction on a _ of one to 10.
Danes  --who expressed a high level of trust in their politicians and public institutions--came top of the field at 8.3. Italians--who reported lower levels of satisfaction with their national quality of government--came last at 6.49.' ""Italy, Greece, Portugal, Germany and France report the lowest levels of happiness while the Scandinavian Countries, Netherlands and Luxembourg report the highest,"" the study said.
Although Europeans are generally four times wealthier than their fathers and grandfathers, their levels of happiness are either equal to or lower than 40 years ago. The study also looked at factors contributing to happiness within countries and surprisingly found that an interest in politics actually increased happiness.
Lead researcher Luisa Corrado said tax cuts and throwing money at social problems appeared to have no effect on the happiness of citizens when compared with government policies which strengthened and supported wider social networks.  ""People are less naive ( ) than one would expect, politicians need to adapted their policies and target specific problems in specific areas,"" she said.

Context: Joker found one of the biggest diamonds in the world right in his own back yard. He sold the stone to a diamond dealer for over three hundred thousand dollars. In New York, the diamond was resold---this time for almost eight hundred thousand dollars. The true value of a diamond is never known until it has been cut. Once cut successfully, its value can increase a thousand times. It's easy to understand why the owner of Joker's diamond went to the best diamond cutter he knew, Kaplan.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH.

Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful.

Context: On the old-time farm in America, there were chickens, cows, pigs and horses. But there were very few machines. Most of the work was done by the farm family. Sometimes more workmen were needed in busy seasons. Work done by horses took up 79 percent; by men, 15 percent; and machine work only took up 6 percent.
Today all that has changed. On many modern farms machines now will do 96 percent of the work, while man does 3 percent. As for horses, they do 1 percent of the whole work. The children go to school by bus every morning; the parents work on the farm or in the house and other people's help is hardly needed. Their work has been replaced by a whole army of farm machines. 
 Question:Today on an American farm machines do   _   times more work than in the past.

The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.

The highest mountain is Ben Nevis in Scotland. Plains and valleys cover much of England. The British climate is mild.
About 58 million people live in the United Kingdom. Few other countries are so crowded. Four out of five people live in cities such as Belfast, Glasgow, and London. London is the capital. Great Britain grows half of the food it needs. Its industries help to pay for the food that is bought from abroad. The United Kingdom manufactures a wide range of goods.

Context: Poor families in some countries spend as much as eighty percent of their money on food. Rising prices in recent months have created the worst food crisis  in more than thirty years. The United Nations World Food Program says high food prices could push one hundred million people into hunger.
Nathan Childs is an expert on rice markets. He notes that the harvest for the latest growing season was the largest on record. But India, Vietnam and others have restricted exports  to keep prices down at home and protect supplies.
Thailand's agriculture minister says his country will never restrict rice exports. He told the Reuters news agency Thursday that Thailand has enough supplies to meet demand at home and for export.
Thailand is the world's largest rice exporter. Recent signs of an increase in supplies have helped ease record prices for Thai rice. Prices rose last week above one thousand dollars a ton.
Vietnam, the second biggest exporter, has banned  exports until June. And Vietnamese officials have now warned that non-food traders who buy rice for speculation will be severely punished.
Some experts say speculation is a necessary part of market activity. But the head of the U.N. Environment Program blames it for the high food prices. ""We have enough food on this planet today to feed everyone."" Achim Steiner told the Associated Press.
Earlier, a member of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission didn't accept the idea that speculators are the main cause. Bart Chilton blamed reduced harvests and grain supplies and the falling value of the dollar.
U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called heads of major international agencies to a meeting this week in the Swiss capital, Bern. He says high food prices could harm world trade, economic growth, social progress and political security. 
 Question:What is the main idea of the passage? 
A. Vietnam has banned rice exports to other countries. 
B. Thailand is the largest rice exporter in the world. 
C. Some families are too poor to afford enough food. 
D. Rising prices of food have led to the world food crisis.

Context: When Denis Hennequin took over as the European boss of McDonald's in January 2004, the world's biggest restaurant chain was showing signs of recovery in America and Australia, but sales in Europe were sluggish or declining.One exception was France, where Mr.Hennequin had done a reliable job as head on the group's French subsidiary  to sell more Big Macs to his relatives, His task was to copy this success in all 41 of the European countries where anti-globalisers' favourite enemy operates.

Context: On the old-time farm in America, there were chickens, cows, pigs and horses. But there were very few machines. Most of the work was done by the farm family. Sometimes more workmen were needed in busy seasons. Work done by horses took up 79 percent; by men, 15 percent; and machine work only took up 6 percent.
Today all that has changed. On many modern farms machines now will do 96 percent of the work, while man does 3 percent. As for horses, they do 1 percent of the whole work. The children go to school by bus every morning; the parents work on the farm or in the house and other people's help is hardly needed. Their work has been replaced by a whole army of farm machines. 
 Question:Today on an American farm machines do   _   times more work than in the past.

Context: A U.S. dad quit his job, giving up a massive salary, after his 10-year-old daughter gave him a 22-point list outlining all the events he missed so far during the year. As the CEO of the $2 trillion global investment fund PIMCO, Mohamed El-Erian shocked the finance industry when he quit in January.
El-Erian said it was about a year ago when he was repeatedly asking his daughter to brush her teeth, but she wasn't listening. When he asked her why, she responded with a list of 22 milestones he had missed: like the first day of school and the first soccer game of the season.
""And the school year wasn't yet over,"" El-Erian wrote. ""I felt awful and got defensive: I had a good excuse for each missed event! Travel, important meetings, and urgent phone call, sudden to-dos. But it dawned on me that I was missing an infinitely more important point. My work-life balance had gotten out of whack, and the imbalance was hurting my very special relationship with my daughter. I was not making enough time for her."" El-Erian explained he was struggling with the same thing so many parents do--work-life balance.
Dads who are quitting their profit-making jobs to improve work-life balance is a subject that is getting more traction as some high-profile executive have recently written about their experiences.
Last month, former MongoDB CEO Max Schireson wrote a blog post for Time about his decision to step down from the company's top job. He wrote that he struggled to make time for his three children because he was flying around half a million kilometres a year for work.
""I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car, or when my son had an emergency surgery,"" Schireson wrote.
On an overnight flight to Texas he woke up in Arizona to discover the plane made an emergency landing and some traumatized crew members had to be replaced. He decided it was time to address his work-life balance.
Quitting is something El-Erian and Schireson were financially able to do, but El-Erian recognizes most people don't have this luxury. He hopes companies will pay attention to improving work-life balance for their employees.
El-Erian now manages ""a portfolio of part-time jobs"" that don't require as much travel. He alternates mornings with his wife taking their daughter to school and he often picks her up from school.
""So far, it's been the right decision for me,"" he wrote. ""I'm so grateful that this is providing me greater opportunity to experience key moments in my daughter's life before they're all too quickly gone."" 
 Question:El-Erian resigned from PIMCO mainly because   _  . 
A. his daughter has been missing him badly 
B. he was getting bored with the endless flights 
C. he hoped to get his daughter to listen to her 
D. he wanted to experience his daughter's milestones

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT."" 
 Question:The price of the knives was cut down by half because   _  . 
A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap 
D. the knives were produced in one factory

Context: It is ""one of the few bright spots in the Chinese economy,"" says Zeng Ming. He is talking about e-commerce. Mr Zeng, the chief strategy officer for Alibaba, a giant Chinese Internet firm, predicts that digital transactions on his firm's platforms will top l trillion yuan ($159 billion) this year-more than Amazon's and eBay's combined. That is a bold claim, but consider what happened on Singles Sunday.
Invented a few years ago by students and seized upon by digital marketers, this festival for lonely hearts falls annually on the  llth day of the llth month (since l is the loneliest number).It is like St Valentine's Day, only worse. Singletons shower each other with tender gifts: a barrage of pearls; a storm of sweets.
This November llth they spent a surprising 19 billion yuan on Alibaba's online platforms-a fourfold increase on a year ago, and more than double what Americans spent online last Cyber Monday (the Monday after Thanksgiving, when retailers urge Americans to shop online). About 100m purchases were logged, accounting for 80% of the packages shipped that day. Couriers  were buried in parcels.
So life is good for China's e-tailers, then? Not exactly. The number of digital marketers is increasing and online sales are booming. Consumers are enjoying lower prices, better service and more variety. The problem? The pressure on profits in Chinese e-commerce is worse than in America, reckons Elinor Leung of CLSA, a broker. ""Almost no one makes money,"" she says.

Context: Supply and demand is perhaps one of the most basic concepts of economics and it is the backbone of a market economy. Demand refers to how much of a product or service is desired by buyers. The quantity demanded is the amount of a product people are willing to buy at a certain price; the relationship between price and quantity demanded is known as the demand relationship. Supply represents how much the market can offer. The quantity supplied refers to the amount of a certain goods producers are willing to supply when receiving a certain price. The relationship between price and how much of a goods or service is supplied to the market is known as the supply relationship. Price, therefore, is a reflection of supply and demand.
   The law of demand states that, if all other factors remain equal, the higher the price of a product, the fewer people will demand that product. The amount of goods that buyers purchase at a higher price is less as the price of a product goes up, so does the opportunity cost of buying that product.
   Like the law of demand, the law of supply shows the quantities that will be sold at a certain price. But unlike the law of demand, the supply relationship shows an upward slope. This means that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. Producers supply more at a higher price because selling a higher quantity at a higher price increases the whole income.
   Now that we know the laws of supply and demand, let's turn to an example to show how supply and demand affect price.
   Imagine that a CD of your favorite band is sold for $20. Because the record company's previous analysis showed that consumers will not demand CDs at a price higher than $20, only ten CDs were sold because the opportunity cost is too high for suppliers to produce more. If, however, the ten CDs are demanded by 20 people, the price will then rise. As a result, the rise in price should cause more CDs to be supplied as the supply relationship shows that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. If, however, there are 30 CDs produced and demand is still at 20, the price will not be pushed up because the supply is more than the demand. 
 Question:We know from the passage that changes in the prices of product cause changes in   _  . 
A. income and expense 
B. invention and production 
C. market and society 
D. supply and demand

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer

The Chicago school's 420 students learn about economic . They also get a chance to make money. Each 1stgrade and 5thgrade, students learn the basics of economics and investing .
Then in 6thgrade, they put what they've learned to work. Students join a junior group that manages the $20,000. The group, made up of 12 to 14 students, decides which stocks to buy.

In 2007, Bills suggested that her class buy the stock of the Apple computer company. This was just before the iPhone came out. ""We bought stock just at the right time,"" she says. The kids bought Google stock as it reached $400 a share. It is now worth over $500. ""It was a good buy,"" says Myles Gate, 13. He hopes to be a banker one day.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: prefix = st1 /China's economic growth 'hard to predict'
The worsening global economic situation makes it difficult for Chinato predict its growth for next year, a senior official said on Friday.
""How fast China's economy will grow next year is uncertain,"" Liu He, deputy director of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Finance and Economy Work, told China Daily.
""To a large  _ , the rate will be decided by the external situation,"" Liu said during a discussion with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and other economists in Beijing.
This year, GDP is estimated to grow at 9.4 or 9.5 percent, down from 10.6 percent last year, he said. However, the impact of the current financial turbulence ""on our economy is much less than on the rest of the world"", he said.
Nicholas Stern, a former UK government advisor, also told China Daily it will take at least one or two years for the world to recover from the recession, which is now spreading from the US and the UK to the rest of the world.
""We don't know how long the recession will last, but it is unlikely to be short,"" he said.
Liu said China can use the downturn as an opportunity to restructure its economy, which has relied heavily on government investment, foreign trade and low-cost technology over the past years.
""When the economy is experiencing fast growth, companies are unwilling to upgrade their technologies,"" Liu said.
""The slowdown gives such firms the opportunity to enhance their competitive edge through better technologies.""
From ChinaDaily 2008-10-25 
 Question:According to the passage, the reason why Liu said this downturn is an opportunity for Chinato restructure its economy is that   _  . 
A. China's economy will not depend on government investment in the future 
B. Foreign trade will grow in the future 
C. The downturn will forceChina's companies to upgrade their technologies 
D. Low-cost technologies will not exist inChina

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----. 
A. planted less corn 
B. planted morn crops 
C. planted morn wheat 
D. earned more money 
 Answer: D
Context: It is a matter of common observation that although money income keeps going up over the years, we never seem to become richer. Prices are rising continuously. This condition is what we call inflation: the money supply is becoming inflated so that each unit of it becomes less valuable. We have got used to higher and higher rates of inflation in recent years. What could be bought twenty years ago for one pound now costs well over 2 pounds. And at present this rate of inflation seems to be rising rather than falling. If in the real world our money incomes go up at the same rate as prices do. One might think that inflation doesn't matter. _ When money is losing value it also loses one of the qualities of a good money--stability of value. It is no longer acceptable as a store of value; and it becomes an unsuitable means of delayed payment. Nobody wants to hold a wasting possession, so people try to get rid of money as quickly as possible. Inflation therefore simply stimulates our spending and discourages saving. 
 Question:.We can conclude according to the passage that   _  . 
A. the writer is a government official 
B. the writer is worried about inflation 
C. the writer encourages people to spend money 
D. the writer has become richer because of inflation

Context: If you go to Finland, you'll be surprised to find how ""foolish"" the Finnish people are.
Take the taxi drivers for example. Taxis in Finland are mostly high class Benz with a fare   of two US dollars a kilometer. You can go anywhere in one, tell the driver to drop you at any place, say that you have some business to attend to, and then get off without paying your fare. And the driver would not show the least sign of worry.
The dining rooms in all big hotels not only serve their guests, but also outside diners. Hotel guests have their meals free, so their good faith is to wave their registration card to the waiter. With such a loose check, you can easily use any old registration card to take a couple of friends and dine free of charge.
With so many loopholes   in everyday life, surely Finland must be a heaven to those who love to take ""pretty advantages"". But the strange things is, all the taxi-passengers would always come back to pay their fare after they have attended to their business; not a single outsider has ever been found in the free hotel dining rooms. As the Finns always act on good faith and always show an attitude of ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" in everything they do, so to live in such a society has turned everyone into a real ""gentleman"". In a society of such high moral practice, what need is there for people to take precautions   against others? 
 Question:The sentences ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" show that   _  . 
A. the Finns are foolish 
B. the Finns take things seriously 
C. the Finns are busy making money for the family 
D. the Finns never take precaution against others 
 Answer: B
Context: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth.
An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, ""the worst came to the worst"". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door.
The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced.
Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank. He says the plant seeds would only be used when all other seeds are gone for some reason. Norwayfirst proposed the idea in the 1980s. But security concerns delayed the plan. At that time, the Soviet Union was meeting inRomeof the Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the above passage? 
A. The government of Norwaywill perform the project alone. 
B. Seeds to be collected there were produced ten thousands years ago. 
C. Spitsbergen is chosen because it is free of the threat unclear war forever. 
D. Temperature is a major consideration when choosing the storage place.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation.

Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting.

But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns.

 Answer: C
Context: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the eleventh largest nation in Europe. England, Wales and Scotland make up the island of Great Britain, which takes up most of the Britain Isles. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are mountainous. The highest mountain is Ben Nevis in Scotland. Plains and valleys cover much of England. The British climate is mild.
About 58 million people live in the United Kingdom. Few other countries are so crowded. Four out of five people live in cities such as Belfast, Glasgow, and London. London is the capital. Great Britain grows half of the food it needs. Its industries help to pay for the food that is bought from abroad. The United Kingdom manufactures a wide range of goods. Service industries, such as tourism, that provide services rather than producing goods, are increasing. Traditional industries, such as coal mining, are declining. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the statements is true? 
A. Great Britain grows all of the food it needs. 
B. The United Kingdom manufactures a narrow range of goods. 
C. The speed of tourism in UK is increasing faster than producing goods. 
D. The coal mining is also increasing fast. 
 Answer: C
Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer

Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption 
 Answer: D
Context: Supply and demand is perhaps one of the most basic concepts of economics and it is the backbone of a market economy. Demand refers to how much of a product or service is desired by buyers. The quantity demanded is the amount of a product people are willing to buy at a certain price; the relationship between price and quantity demanded is known as the demand relationship. Supply represents how much the market can offer. The quantity supplied refers to the amount of a certain goods producers are willing to supply when receiving a certain price. The relationship between price and how much of a goods or service is supplied to the market is known as the supply relationship. Price, therefore, is a reflection of supply and demand.
   The law of demand states that, if all other factors remain equal, the higher the price of a product, the fewer people will demand that product. The amount of goods that buyers purchase at a higher price is less as the price of a product goes up, so does the opportunity cost of buying that product.
   Like the law of demand, the law of supply shows the quantities that will be sold at a certain price. But unlike the law of demand, the supply relationship shows an upward slope. This means that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. Producers supply more at a higher price because selling a higher quantity at a higher price increases the whole income.
   Now that we know the laws of supply and demand, let's turn to an example to show how supply and demand affect price.
   Imagine that a CD of your favorite band is sold for $20. Because the record company's previous analysis showed that consumers will not demand CDs at a price higher than $20, only ten CDs were sold because the opportunity cost is too high for suppliers to produce more. If, however, the ten CDs are demanded by 20 people, the price will then rise. As a result, the rise in price should cause more CDs to be supplied as the supply relationship shows that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. If, however, there are 30 CDs produced and demand is still at 20, the price will not be pushed up because the supply is more than the demand. 
 Question:We know from the passage that changes in the prices of product cause changes in   _  . 
A. income and expense 
B. invention and production 
C. market and society 
D. supply and demand

Context: On the old-time farm in America, there were chickens, cows, pigs and horses. But there were very few machines. Most of the work was done by the farm family. Sometimes more workmen were needed in busy seasons. Work done by horses took up 79 percent; by men, 15 percent; and machine work only took up 6 percent.
Today all that has changed. On many modern farms machines now will do 96 percent of the work, while man does 3 percent. As for horses, they do 1 percent of the whole work. The children go to school by bus every morning; the parents work on the farm or in the house and other people's help is hardly needed. Their work has been replaced by a whole army of farm machines.

Context: A U.S. dad quit his job, giving up a massive salary, after his 10-year-old daughter gave him a 22-point list outlining all the events he missed so far during the year. As the CEO of the $2 trillion global investment fund PIMCO, Mohamed El-Erian shocked the finance industry when he quit in January.
El-Erian said it was about a year ago when he was repeatedly asking his daughter to brush her teeth, but she wasn't listening. When he asked her why, she responded with a list of 22 milestones he had missed: like the first day of school and the first soccer game of the season.
""And the school year wasn't yet over,"" El-Erian wrote. ""I felt awful and got defensive: I had a good excuse for each missed event! Travel, important meetings, and urgent phone call, sudden to-dos. But it dawned on me that I was missing an infinitely more important point. My work-life balance had gotten out of whack, and the imbalance was hurting my very special relationship with my daughter. I was not making enough time for her."" El-Erian explained he was struggling with the same thing so many parents do--work-life balance.
Dads who are quitting their profit-making jobs to improve work-life balance is a subject that is getting more traction as some high-profile executive have recently written about their experiences.
Last month, former MongoDB CEO Max Schireson wrote a blog post for Time about his decision to step down from the company's top job. He wrote that he struggled to make time for his three children because he was flying around half a million kilometres a year for work.
""I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car, or when my son had an emergency surgery,"" Schireson wrote.
On an overnight flight to Texas he woke up in Arizona to discover the plane made an emergency landing and some traumatized crew members had to be replaced. He decided it was time to address his work-life balance.
Quitting is something El-Erian and Schireson were financially able to do, but El-Erian recognizes most people don't have this luxury. He hopes companies will pay attention to improving work-life balance for their employees.
El-Erian now manages ""a portfolio of part-time jobs"" that don't require as much travel. He alternates mornings with his wife taking their daughter to school and he often picks her up from school.
""So far, it's been the right decision for me,"" he wrote. ""I'm so grateful that this is providing me greater opportunity to experience key moments in my daughter's life before they're all too quickly gone."" 
 Question:El-Erian resigned from PIMCO mainly because   _  . 
A. his daughter has been missing him badly 
B. he was getting bored with the endless flights 
C. he hoped to get his daughter to listen to her 
D. he wanted to experience his daughter's milestones

Context: An environment group called the Food Commission is unhappy and disappointed because of the sales of bottled water from Japan. The water, it angrily argues in public, has traveled 10,000 "" _ "" before it reaches Western customers. ""Transporting water half-way across the world is surely the extremely stupid use of fuel when there is plenty of water in the UK."" It is also worried that we are wasting our fuel by buying prawns from Indonesia (7,000 food miles) and carrots from South Africa (5,900 food miles).
Counting the number of miles traveled by a product is a strange way of trying to tell the true situation of the environmental damage done by an industry. Most food is transported around the world on container ships that are extremely energy-efficient. It should be noted that a ton of butter transported 25 miles in a truck to a farmers' market does not necessarily use less fuel on its journey than a similar product transported hundreds of miles by sea, Besides, the idea of ""food miles"" ignores the amount of fuel used in the production. It is possible to cut down your food miles by buying tomatoes grown in Britain rather than those grown in Ghana; the difference is that the British ones will have been raised in heated greenhouses and the Ghanaian ones in the open sun.
What is the idea of ""food miles"" does provide, however, is the chance to cut out Third World countries from First World food markets. The number of miles traveled by our food should, as I see it, be regarded as a sign of the success of the global trade system, not a sign of damage to the environment.

A. a supporter of free global trade 
B. a member of the Food Commission

It is possible to cut down your food miles by buying tomatoes grown in Britain rather than those grown in Ghana; the difference is that the British ones will have been raised in heated greenhouses and the Ghanaian ones in the open sun.
What is the idea of ""food miles"" does provide, however, is the chance to cut out Third World countries from First World food markets. The number of miles traveled by our food should, as I see it, be regarded as a sign of the success of the global trade system, not a sign of damage to the environment. 
 Question:By comparing tomatoes raised in Britain and in Ghana, the author tries to explain that  _  . 
A. British tomatoes are healthier than Ghanaian ones 
B. Ghanaian tomatoes taste better than British ones 
C. cutting down food miles may not necessarily save fuel 
D. protecting the environment may cost a lot of money

Context: Supply and demand is perhaps one of the most basic concepts of economics and it is the backbone of a market economy. Demand refers to how much of a product or service is desired by buyers. The quantity demanded is the amount of a product people are willing to buy at a certain price; the relationship between price and quantity demanded is known as the demand relationship. Supply represents how much the market can offer. The quantity supplied refers to the amount of a certain goods producers are willing to supply when receiving a certain price. The relationship between price and how much of a goods or service is supplied to the market is known as the supply relationship. Price, therefore, is a reflection of supply and demand.
   The law of demand states that, if all other factors remain equal, the higher the price of a product, the fewer people will demand that product. The amount of goods that buyers purchase at a higher price is less as the price of a product goes up, so does the opportunity cost of buying that product.
   Like the law of demand, the law of supply shows the quantities that will be sold at a certain price. But unlike the law of demand, the supply relationship shows an upward slope. This means that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. Producers supply more at a higher price because selling a higher quantity at a higher price increases the whole income.
   Now that we know the laws of supply and demand, let's turn to an example to show how supply and demand affect price.
   Imagine that a CD of your favorite band is sold for $20. Because the record company's previous analysis showed that consumers will not demand CDs at a price higher than $20, only ten CDs were sold because the opportunity cost is too high for suppliers to produce more. If, however, the ten CDs are demanded by 20 people, the price will then rise. As a result, the rise in price should cause more CDs to be supplied as the supply relationship shows that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. If, however, there are 30 CDs produced and demand is still at 20, the price will not be pushed up because the supply is more than the demand. 
 Question:We know from the passage that changes in the prices of product cause changes in   _  . 
A. income and expense 
B. invention and production 
C. market and society 
D. supply and demand 
 Answer: D

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

Context: It is ""one of the few bright spots in the Chinese economy,"" says Zeng Ming. He is talking about e-commerce. Mr Zeng, the chief strategy officer for Alibaba, a giant Chinese Internet firm, predicts that digital transactions on his firm's platforms will top l trillion yuan ($159 billion) this year-more than Amazon's and eBay's combined. That is a bold claim, but consider what happened on Singles Sunday.
Invented a few years ago by students and seized upon by digital marketers, this festival for lonely hearts falls annually on the  llth day of the llth month (since l is the loneliest number).It is like St Valentine's Day, only worse. Singletons shower each other with tender gifts: a barrage of pearls; a storm of sweets.
This November llth they spent a surprising 19 billion yuan on Alibaba's online platforms-a fourfold increase on a year ago, and more than double what Americans spent online last Cyber Monday (the Monday after Thanksgiving, when retailers urge Americans to shop online). About 100m purchases were logged, accounting for 80% of the packages shipped that day. Couriers  were buried in parcels.
So life is good for China's e-tailers, then? Not exactly. The number of digital marketers is increasing and online sales are booming. Consumers are enjoying lower prices, better service and more variety. The problem? The pressure on profits in Chinese e-commerce is worse than in America, reckons Elinor Leung of CLSA, a broker. ""Almost no one makes money,"" she says.
The fiercest battles are being fought between online retailers and their bricks-and-mortar  rivals.Dangdang, a firm. that resembles Amazon,.and 360buy, another online retailer, have cut prices fiercely. Tencent, a cash-rich online giant known for its instant-messaging software, is splashing out to win market share. 360buy has also just raised $400m from investors to do the same. But it is unclear how much longer such firms can burn through capital. 
 Question:According to Zeng Ming, this year Alibaba will_. 
A. outweigh Amazon and eBay in worldwide influence 
B. rank top among all the Internet firms

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT.""

Context: Restaurants in Europe, the United States and Japan are testing technology to let diners order their food direct from a screen at their table instead of depending on a fellow human being to note their choice.

Context: Vienna-In spite of Iraq's decision to stop oil deliveries, the 11- nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries(OPEC)will not increase production to make up the shortfall, ministers decided Tuesday in Vienna.
The 11 oil ministers decided to meet again on July 3 to discuss the effects of the Iraq temporary stop. The organization's president, Charkid Kheria of Algeria, said after the meeting that stocks were high and prices were stable, so quota increases were not necessary.
The E.U. Commission has expressed concern about Iraq's output stop. A speaker said OPEC had to take all possible measures to keep or lower the oil price.
Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Ali Al-Nuaimi had earlier said there would not be any shortfall of oil in the market. The organization had already taken steps to fill the gap, he said. OPEC Secretary General Ali Rodriguez added that the period of Iraq's output stop was not known, so other exporters were not going to lift quotas yet. If the market was destabilized (......), a suitable response could be made.
Iraq on Monday stopped shipments of crude oil to protest against the U.N. Security Council's decision to extend the oil-for-food programme by only a month, instead of the normal six-month renewal. Just before the Vienna meeting, oil prices had gone up, with a barrel of OPEC crude oil selling for 27.05 dollars, up from 26.81 dollars last Friday. North Sea oil was at 29.26 dollars Monday evening.
OPEC wants the oil price to stay within a margin of 22 to 28 dollars and achieved that with cuts in January and March that reduced 2.5 million barrels per day off quotas . 
 Question:The 11 oil ministers decided to meet on July 3 so that   _  . 
A. they can persuade Iraq to continue oil production 
B. they can have a talk with the U.N. Security Council 
C. they can have a discussion about the effects of Iraq's temporary output stop 
D. they can make up their minds to increase oil production

Context: In 2007.five young people in the American state of Massachusetts developed an idea. The team knew that the world is filled with mobile phones.About eighty percent of all people are said to live within reach of a wireless telephone signal.    
    The idea was to use mobile phones and the Internet to connect job seekers with employers.The young people wrote a business plan and formed a company called Assured Labor.
    Assured Labor won a development competition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Three of the founders were graduate students there.    '
    Assured Labo is an electronic market place.It has two parts.One is for;the United States.That operation was launched in January in Boston.It links people with employees offering temporary jobs.
    The other arm of the business is for developing markets.That operation is meant to help people get mbfe permanent jobs.A representative is currently building partnerships with universities,and international companies in Central America.
    Assured Labor's president David Reich,says the companies now place job advertisements on radio or in newspapers.Some even drive around in cars with loudspeakers announcing that jobs are available.He says the companies are interested.in having more modem hiring practices.
    Through Assured Labor, companies will list open positions on the Internet.People who think
 they could do the job could reply by text messages or on their cellophanes.
    This is how the system works inprefix = st1 /Boston.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

Context: Local businessmen are increasingly facing competition from on line retailers. Larry Pollock, owner of Camera Co/Op on South Congress, said he has been dealing with this kind of problem for years, even before the Internet. The struggle began with mail-order catalogues, which are similar to online retailers in that they have few employees to pay, no sales tax fees and no business venue to lease and manage.
""Their overhead is lower, but they don't offer a service like we do,"" Pollock said.
Pollock, however, said providing a valuable service to customers does not always guarantee continued sales.
""We spend 30 minutes to an hour with somebody and they go home and buy it online,"" he said.
According to the state comptroller's office, online shopping is developing at a more rapid rate than traditional businesses.
In spite of how fair or unfair online shopping may be to the local businessmen, consumers will continue to turn to the Internet for its variety and accessibility, said Mitch Wilson, an online shopper. ""You have a larger selection and it's easier to compare prices.""
 Wilson said he built his personal computer and paid a third of the price by shopping online.
""Before the Internet, I would have had to go and buy an assembled computer from somebody like Dell,"" he said. ""Before I started shopping online I could never find all the pieces I wanted. No single store had everything needed, so shopping online saved me from having to buy from Dell.""
Janny Brazeal, a psychology freshman, said online shopping is too impersonal.
""I'd rather see it in person, touch it, know that I'm getting it,"" she said.
Brazeal also said she would not give out her credit card number or other personal information online no matter how safe the site claims it is. 
 Question:Mitch Wilson prefers to build his personal computer by shopping on line because   _  . 
A. he can easily get what he needs at a lower price

C. he is not satisfied with the service of local businessman 
D. the quality of Dell is not satisfying

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT.""

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year.

The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government.

Context: When Denis Hennequin took over as the European boss of McDonald's in January 2004, the world's biggest restaurant chain was showing signs of recovery in America and Australia, but sales in Europe were sluggish or declining.One exception was France, where Mr.Hennequin had done a reliable job as head on the group's French subsidiary  to sell more Big Macs to his relatives, His task was to copy this success in all 41 of the European countries where anti-globalisers' favourite enemy operates.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns.

A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.

Context: Who are the top students in the world, do you know? Last week the Organization for Economic Co-operation Development   picked the best students in the world. They are Finnish  . The OECD gave a test to 280 000 15-year-old students from more than 40 countries and regions   last year. The OECD wanted to know how well students were doing at school.
Finnish students were No. 1 in the reading test and second in maths after Hong Kong students. Those from Japan and Finland were top in science. In the problem solving, Finnish students came second to those from South Korea. The test also showed Finland had more top students than the other countries.
Finns   of your age have done a really good job but don't have a sense of envy. You can learn from them. Most Finnish students make good use of the Internet. Of course not for computer games, but for doing more exercises and finding out more information.
Libraries are also important. Finland spends a lot of money on them. Many students have a free card. They read for at least one or two hours a day.
What do you usually do on the Internet? How often do you go to libraries? 
 Question:Students from which country or region did best in the reading test? 
A. South Korea. 
B. Hong Kong. 
C. Finland. 
D. Japan.

Context: My summer hols wr CWOT. B4, we usd 2 go 2 NY 2C my bro, his CF & thr 3:-@ kids FTF ILNY, its gr8.
Can you understand this sentence? If you can't, don't feel too bad: neither could the middle school teacher in England who received this as homework. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cellphones. To newcomers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the ""translation"" of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York; it's great.
Schoolteachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes cxan be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted .
Everyone should just relax, say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nunberg, from Stanford University, agrees. ""People get better at writing by writing,"" he says, ""Kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mail, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than, their parents.""
Linguist James Millroy says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can bet your bottom dollar that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents, they too will think this way. Milroy argues that languages do not and cannot become ""corrupted""; they simply change to meet the new needs.
However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write Standard English. Cynthia McVey says, ""I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but that learning to write proper English is a must for their future.""
Perhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway. Erin, age 12, says, ""I wouldn't use text language in my homework. Texting is just for fun"" 
 Question:Which of the following is true according to the passage? 
A. Cynthia McVey points out teenagers can deal with Netspeak properly. 
B. Geoffrey Nunberg believes Netspeakers can write Standard English. 
C. David Crystal thinks Netspeak helps develop the habit of writing. 
D. James Milroy says that language is changing and improving.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT."" 
 Question:The price of the knives was cut down by half because   _  . 
A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap 
D. the knives were produced in one factory

And for sweeping the common corridor................................... $2.00

His mother looked at him standing there expecting payment. I could see a thousand memories flashed through her mind. So she picked up the pen and turning the paper over, this is what she wrote : 
For nine months I carried you, growing inside me .................. No Charge
For the nights I sat up with you, doctored and prayed for you......No Charge
For the toys, food and clothes and wiping your nose ................No Charge
When you add it all up, the full cost of my love.......................No Charge

Context: An environment group called the Food Commission is unhappy and disappointed because of the sales of bottled water from Japan. The water, it angrily argues in public, has traveled 10,000 "" _ "" before it reaches Western customers. ""Transporting water half-way across the world is surely the extremely stupid use of fuel when there is plenty of water in the UK."" It is also worried that we are wasting our fuel by buying prawns from Indonesia (7,000 food miles) and carrots from South Africa (5,900 food miles).
Counting the number of miles traveled by a product is a strange way of trying to tell the true situation of the environmental damage done by an industry. Most food is transported around the world on container ships that are extremely energy-efficient. It should be noted that a ton of butter transported 25 miles in a truck to a farmers' market does not necessarily use less fuel on its journey than a similar product transported hundreds of miles by sea, Besides, the idea of ""food miles"" ignores the amount of fuel used in the production. It is possible to cut down your food miles by buying tomatoes grown in Britain rather than those grown in Ghana; the difference is that the British ones will have been raised in heated greenhouses and the Ghanaian ones in the open sun.
What is the idea of ""food miles"" does provide, however, is the chance to cut out Third World countries from First World food markets. The number of miles traveled by our food should, as I see it, be regarded as a sign of the success of the global trade system, not a sign of damage to the environment.

Context: As the saying goes, man struggles upwards; water flows downwards. Water runs downhill from mountaintops to streams to rivers to oceans. But downhill isn't the only way that water moves .A new study measures how water travels from country to country for human consumption. This flow isn't the type we usually think about .These scientists looked at the water used to grow and make the products which get shipped from nation to nation as imports or exports. They call this a flow of ""virtual water "".
We typically think about water as the liquid that flows from a tap. However,92%of the water used by people goes into growing crops,according to water researcher Arjen Hoekstra. He recently studied the hidden travels of virtual water used in products made from things like crops and meats .These products are shipped around the world.
For example, consider a sugary soft drink. Hoekstra estimated that to produce one half-liter of the drink requires between 170 and 310liters of the water--about 95%--is used to grow and process the ingredients .Another 4%goes into the packaging and labeling. In Hoekstra's calculation, when one country produces a half-liter of soda and sells it abroad,it exports as much virtual water as would fill a large refrigerator.
According to Hoekstra's new report,dry countries like Israel and Kuwait,both in the Middle East,get the majority of their virtual water from other countries,through imported products. More surprisingly, some wetter countries,like the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, also get the majority of their virtual water from other places. That means that most of the water used to grow or produce the products and food consumed in those countries came from other countries.
In the United States most of the virtual water used comes from American sources .In China even less of the water associated with its products.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.

 Answer: B
Context: Money spent on advertising is money spent as well as any I know of. It selves directly to bring about a rapid sale of goods at reasonable prices, so setting up a firm home market and so making it possible to provide for export at good prices. By drawing attention to new ideas it helps greatly to raise standards of living. By helping to increase demand it causes an increased need for labor, and is therefore a nice way to fight unemployment. It lowers the costs of many services: without advertisements your daily newspaper would cost four times as much, the price of your television program would need to be doubled, and travel by bus or subway would cost more.
And perhaps most important of all, advertising provides a promise of reasonable value in the products and services you buy. Besides the fact that twenty-seven Acts of Parliament govern the terms of advertising, no regular advertiser dare promote a product that fails to live up to the promise of his advertisements. He might fool some people for a little while through misleading advertising. He will not do so for long, for the public has the good sense not to buy the poor article more than once. If you see an article frequently advertised, it is the proof I know that the article does what is promised for it, and that it has good value.
Advertising does more for the good of the public than any other force I can think of.
There is one more point I feel I ought to touch on. Recently I heard a well-known television person declare that he was against advertising because it persuades rather than informs. He was telling us the real difference. Of course advertising tries to persuade.
If its message were nothing but information, that would be difficult to get more people to buy, for even a detail such as the choice of the color of a shirt is a bit persuasive-advertising would be so boring that no one would pay any attention. But perhaps that is what the well-known television person wants. 
 Question:By the first sentence of the passage the writer means that  _  . 
A. he is fairly familiar with the cost of advertising 
B. everybody knows well that advertising is a waste of money 
C. advertising costs more money than everything else 
D. money spent on advertising is worth while 
 Answer: D
Context: On March 5, 2009, Michael Jackson stood in front of crowds of fans. Before screaming fans, he pronounced with pumping arms: ""This is it!""
A few months later, Jackson was dead. With the late pop star's return to radio, television and the cultural events, Forbes judges that Jackson has made $90 million since his death June 25. This figure is based on his royalties  from album sales, radio play, rights to his name and royalties from his stock in the Sony/ATV music catalog  .
Jackson's music was his most easily-seen source in the last months. ""Nothing increases the value of an artist than death ... an untimely death,"" says Barry Massarsky, a music industry economist.
The music's immediate value was clear. Since June, Jackson has sold more than 5.9 million albums in the U.S. and another 4.5 million overseas. In the first weeks after his death, there were 5.6 million single downloads across North America, Europe and Australia. Jackson recently has three of the top 20 best-selling albums of the year in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan. His 2003 hits album Number Ones is the best seller of the year, beating Taylor Swift's Fearless.
More than 500,000 Jackson ringtones and 100,000 music videos were sold. In the week following his death, songs by The Jackson 5, The Jacksons and Michael were played over 100,000 times on the radio, according to Nielsen BDS.
Jackson's estate will likely see more money by the end of this year, as it has rights to some of the profits from This Is It as well as the two-disc album of the same name. The estate will share 90% of the film profits with AEG.
Ticket sales from an exhibit opening in London will also contribute a likely profit. Hundreds of Jackson's personal belongings-his L.A. Rolls Royce etc-will remain on show for three months at the O2 for fans willing to shell out $25 for a view.
The pop singer bought ATV Publishing, for $47.5 million in 1985. Ten years later, he sold the catalog to Sony for $95 million and took a 50% stock in Sony/ATV, which is now worth about $1.7 to $2 billion. So he still owned half the Sony/ATV catalog at his death.
Jackson's future earning potential is based on his stock in valuable music and as well as the value of his image . As many musicians, actors and artists before him, Jackson's fame could have a long tail on the market with allowable products, advertising and entertainment events. 
 Question:All the following is true EXCEPT that   _  . 
A. Rolls Royce is now for show and will finally be sold 
B. Jackson has sold 10.4 million albums since June 
C. Jackson's L. 
D. Jackson's stock in music and his image will keep on earning money in the future

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees 
 Answer: C
Context: Food prices have risen sharply over the past few years. The good news is that the rate of increase has slowed. The bad news is that prices will not go down anytime soon.
Also,the rate of global agricultural production is slowing. Yet it needs to increase 60% over the next 40 years to feed a growing world population.
These are among the findings from the OECDFAO(the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development & the Food and Agriculture Organization)Agricultural Outlook 2012-2021.
FAO DirectorGeneral Jose Graziano da Silva spoke at a news conference in Rome when the report was released. Mr.Da Silva said that,not surprisingly,the world's poorest people will feel the greatest effects of higher prices.
""For the millions and millions of extremely poor people, the effects of high food prices are clear--they might have to change their diets,usually to ones with poorer nutrition quality, ""he said.
In middleincome countries, people are gaining weight as they eat fewer fruits and vegetables and more of the cheaper but less nutritious foods.
The report also shows that farmers in poorer countries will be leading efforts to feed an expected 9,000,000,000 people by 2050.The outlook predicts that farmers in Latin America,the Caribbean and subSaharan Africa will drive agricultural production in the future.
Angel Gurria,SecretaryGeneral of the OECD,said:""We can feed 9,000,000,000 people by 2050 on this planet. But we have to organize ourselves better."" But there are plenty of challenges.Onefourth of all agricultural land is damaged. Many countries face water shortages .And experts believe climate change is driving increasingly unusual weather patterns.
The report says farmers need to use more growing methods that can't cause damage to the environment.At the same time,it says governments should end economically harmful supports and spend more money to increase agricultural production.Mr.Gurria says rich and poor nations need to treat agriculture more like a business.
""In many cases,agriculture is related in people's minds to the poorest. It's related to aid. It's related to very poor living conditions,etc. We have got to shake that image away,""he said. 
 Question:What can be done to deal with the slow agricultural production? 
A. Improving the growing methods. 
B. Finding more agricultural land. 
C. Preventing governments' involvement. 
D. Improving farmers' living conditions. 
 Answer: A

Context: The price of milk may be going up. There was not enough rain in some parts of the country last year and the bad weather may mean that a gallon   of milk will cost 41 cents more after October 1st.
California already has high milk prices and the California court does not want the price to go any higher. High milk prices will be very hard for some people. Families with many children will have to spend more money to buy milk. The poor and older people without much money will also be hurt by higher prices.
The court said that more milk from other states should be sold in California as the price of milk from other states is not as high. Some states got enough rain so their costs did not go up. People will then be able to buy the cheaper milk, meaning that unless milk producers bring their milk prices down, their milk will not sell.
The drought   around the country has meant market forces are likely to push milk prices up by as much as 41-cent a gallon by October 1st. Experts said this decision by the Californian court could reduce   the effect of the price rise here.
The 41-cent increase would add to California's already high milk prices so California must allow more milk producers from outside the state to sell their products there. This would then lead to increased supplies  , which would, as a result, stop milk prices from increasing. 
 Question:What caused milk prices in California to increase? 
A. Short supplies from other states. 
B. Being short of rain. 
C. The California court. 
D. Children's need for milk.

Context: Decreasing grain prices along with growing costs of production means Chinese farmers are unlikely to see a significant rise in income next year. [:ZXXK]
China's economic planning chief Ma Kai expressed the concern as the government undertakes an ambitious program to improve rural people's lives.
Grain prices have been dropping since April; and prices of wheat, corn and rice fell 5 per cent from August to October compared with the same period last year, Ma, minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, told an annual meeting on development and reform held over the weekend.
Meanwhile, prices of production materials rose 9.1 per cent year on year during the first 10 months.
The situation makes it difficult to achieve a ""new socialist countryside,"" which was last week highlighted as a new concept and ""common action"" of the whole Party and nation.
Vice-Minister of Agriculture Yin Chengjie also said China's entry to the World Trade Organization also creates _ for income rises for the country's 780 million farmers.
Farmers' income is expected to increase by 5 per cent this year, hitting the target set by the central government at the beginning of this year.
Last year, per capita net income of Chinese farmers reached 2,936 yuan (US$362), up 6.8 per cent year on year, and the highest increase since 1997.
Ma also said China would continue to seek fast, steady economic growth in 2012 but more efforts will be made to deal with the challenges brought about by overheating in some industrial sectors  .

Context: Eighth-grader Victoria Bills is talking about money with her classmates. She is worried that a company's stock   price could fall. It may be an unusual topic of conversation for a 13-year-old. But at Bills' school in Chicago, US, you hear it all the time.
The Chicago school's 420 students learn about economic . They also get a chance to make money. Each 1stgrade and 5thgrade, students learn the basics of economics and investing .
Then in 6thgrade, they put what they've learned to work. Students join a junior group that manages the $20,000. The group, made up of 12 to 14 students, decides which stocks to buy.
After graduating, students pass on $20,000 to the next 1stgrade class. They keep half of the rest of the money; the other half goes toward improving the school. They can choose to put their money in a college-savings program or take the cash.
In 2007, Bills suggested that her class buy the stock of the Apple computer company. This was just before the iPhone came out. ""We bought stock just at the right time,"" she says. The kids bought Google stock as it reached $400 a share. It is now worth over $500. ""It was a good buy,"" says Myles Gate, 13. He hopes to be a banker one day.

Context: I've tried to explain compound interest to my eight - year - old daughter. When I have finished it, she summarizes back to me, ""So, you are saying if I put $ 100 in the bank, when I turn sixteen the bank will give me $ 200?"" She has already grasped more of the concept than I understood at her age, but she couldn't clearly understand that until she sees them in action.
One day I gave her a Ziploc bag with a handful of pennies and told her over the course of a week I wanted her to give me a penny a day. I would deposit the penny in "" The Bank of Dad"" and compound interest would begin to accumulate the day she deposited the penny. At the end of the week we would check her bank balance.
Each day my daughter handed over one penny at the breakfast table and I deposited it in her bank. I gave her a ""receipt"" for her deposit and explained that she needed to keep up with the receipts to see how much money she had added to her account. In an effort to make this a little more realistic, I deposited a penny from my own piggy bank every other day to give her an additional four pennies at the end of the week.
On Sunday evening we gathered receipts and confirmed she had deposited seven pennies in ""The Bank of Dad. "" Then I opened the old film container and counted out its contents--all eleven pennies. ""Hey, there are four extra pennies in there!"" I explained that her original seven pennies had grown to eleven pennies because every couple days the bank paid her a penny for letting them use her money--that's interest. She paused and asked, ""Dad, what would happen if you deposited like a hundred million pennies in the bank?

Context: It is a matter of common observation that although money income keeps going up over the years, we never seem to become richer. Prices are rising continuously. This condition is what we call inflation: the money supply is becoming inflated so that each unit of it becomes less valuable. We have got used to higher and higher rates of inflation in recent years. What could be bought twenty years ago for one pound now costs well over 2 pounds. And at present this rate of inflation seems to be rising rather than falling. If in the real world our money incomes go up at the same rate as prices do. One might think that inflation doesn't matter. _ When money is losing value it also loses one of the qualities of a good money--stability of value. It is no longer acceptable as a store of value; and it becomes an unsuitable means of delayed payment. Nobody wants to hold a wasting possession, so people try to get rid of money as quickly as possible. Inflation therefore simply stimulates our spending and discourages saving. 
 Question:.We can conclude according to the passage that   _  . 
A. the writer is a government official 
B. the writer is worried about inflation 
C. the writer encourages people to spend money 
D. the writer has become richer because of inflation

Context: I've tried to explain compound interest to my eight - year - old daughter. When I have finished it, she summarizes back to me, ""So, you are saying if I put $ 100 in the bank, when I turn sixteen the bank will give me $ 200?"" She has already grasped more of the concept than I understood at her age, but she couldn't clearly understand that until she sees them in action.
One day I gave her a Ziploc bag with a handful of pennies and told her over the course of a week I wanted her to give me a penny a day. I would deposit the penny in "" The Bank of Dad"" and compound interest would begin to accumulate the day she deposited the penny. At the end of the week we would check her bank balance.
Each day my daughter handed over one penny at the breakfast table and I deposited it in her bank. I gave her a ""receipt"" for her deposit and explained that she needed to keep up with the receipts to see how much money she had added to her account. In an effort to make this a little more realistic, I deposited a penny from my own piggy bank every other day to give her an additional four pennies at the end of the week.
On Sunday evening we gathered receipts and confirmed she had deposited seven pennies in ""The Bank of Dad. "" Then I opened the old film container and counted out its contents--all eleven pennies. ""Hey, there are four extra pennies in there!"" I explained that her original seven pennies had grown to eleven pennies because every couple days the bank paid her a penny for letting them use her money--that's interest. She paused and asked, ""Dad, what would happen if you deposited like a hundred million pennies in the bank? 
 Question:Each day the writer's daughter   _  . 
A. got a penny from her father 
B. received interest from her father 
C. deposited a penny in her piggy bank 
D. handed over one penny to her father

Context: If your parents take out a loan, remind themselves to make the payments on time. Otherwise it will become a negative record in their personal credit reports, which are playing an increasingly big role in people's daily lives. A story carried by Chongqing Morning Post in June, underlines this trend.
According to the report, a Chongqing student borrowed money from the bank to finance his university studies. After he graduated in 2005, he went to work in Shenzhen. Later, he wanted to buy a house using loans. But several banks turned down his loan applications. The reason was that he had not paid back 1,500 yuan he borrowed from a bank when he was at university.
A personal credit rating is becoming an essential ""pass"" in everyday life, as China establishes a nationwide credit database. Personal credit systems go back 150 years. In developed countries, enterprises and banks use them to decide whether or not to loan money or do other business with a person.
A credit report estimates the credit worthiness of an individual, a company, or even a country. It is an evaluation made by credit bureaus of a borrower's overall credit history and his or her ability to repay debt. A poor credit rating means a high risk of defaulting on a loan, and thus leads to the refusal of a loan by the lender.
Today in China, credit history in banks is the major content of a credit report. But in the future, reports will include information about the payment of telephone bills, water use fees, electricity and natural gas bills, and taxes, according to officials of the People's Bank of China, the central bank.
Personal information such as appearance, genetic data, fingerprints, blood type, disease history, ethnic identity, family and religious beliefs are not to be included in credit reports, according to a draft regulation on credit rating issued last year by the Sate Council. The authors of the draft have just finished soliciting  public opinions.
The Credit Reference Center run by the People's Bank of China is in charge of developing a nationwide credit database. Credit reports for all people with bank transactions  began in 2006.
A personal credit rating is important to the social and economic activities of a person. According to the draft, if you have a personal negative credit record, it will be kept for five years. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE? 
A. Personal credit systems go back 150 years in China. 
B. You can turn to the People's Bank of China for the information about your credit report. 
C. Credit history in banks is the only content of a credit report. 
D. Credit reports began in 2006 in China.

 Answer: B
Context: Supply and demand is perhaps one of the most basic concepts of economics and it is the backbone of a market economy. Demand refers to how much of a product or service is desired by buyers. The quantity demanded is the amount of a product people are willing to buy at a certain price; the relationship between price and quantity demanded is known as the demand relationship. Supply represents how much the market can offer. The quantity supplied refers to the amount of a certain goods producers are willing to supply when receiving a certain price. The relationship between price and how much of a goods or service is supplied to the market is known as the supply relationship. Price, therefore, is a reflection of supply and demand.
   The law of demand states that, if all other factors remain equal, the higher the price of a product, the fewer people will demand that product. The amount of goods that buyers purchase at a higher price is less as the price of a product goes up, so does the opportunity cost of buying that product.
   Like the law of demand, the law of supply shows the quantities that will be sold at a certain price. But unlike the law of demand, the supply relationship shows an upward slope. This means that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. Producers supply more at a higher price because selling a higher quantity at a higher price increases the whole income.
   Now that we know the laws of supply and demand, let's turn to an example to show how supply and demand affect price.
   Imagine that a CD of your favorite band is sold for $20. Because the record company's previous analysis showed that consumers will not demand CDs at a price higher than $20, only ten CDs were sold because the opportunity cost is too high for suppliers to produce more. If, however, the ten CDs are demanded by 20 people, the price will then rise. As a result, the rise in price should cause more CDs to be supplied as the supply relationship shows that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. If, however, there are 30 CDs produced and demand is still at 20, the price will not be pushed up because the supply is more than the demand. 
 Question:We know from the passage that changes in the prices of product cause changes in   _  . 
A. income and expense 
B. invention and production 
C. market and society 
D. supply and demand

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT."" 
 Question:The price of the knives was cut down by half because   _  . 
A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap 
D. the knives were produced in one factory

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B
Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting.

But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT.""

Context: Frank Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York., in 1852. His family were very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for showing goods to attract people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends ( ) for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said five cents each. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store., selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1000 stores in the US and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always run his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: "" The customer is always right.""

The Chicago school's 420 students learn about economic . They also get a chance to make money. Each 1stgrade and 5thgrade, students learn the basics of economics and investing .
Then in 6thgrade, they put what they've learned to work. Students join a junior group that manages the $20,000. The group, made up of 12 to 14 students, decides which stocks to buy.

Context: An environment group called the Food Commission is unhappy and disappointed because of the sales of bottled water from Japan. The water, it angrily argues in public, has traveled 10,000 "" _ "" before it reaches Western customers. ""Transporting water half-way across the world is surely the extremely stupid use of fuel when there is plenty of water in the UK."" It is also worried that we are wasting our fuel by buying prawns from Indonesia (7,000 food miles) and carrots from South Africa (5,900 food miles).
Counting the number of miles traveled by a product is a strange way of trying to tell the true situation of the environmental damage done by an industry. Most food is transported around the world on container ships that are extremely energy-efficient. It should be noted that a ton of butter transported 25 miles in a truck to a farmers' market does not necessarily use less fuel on its journey than a similar product transported hundreds of miles by sea, Besides, the idea of ""food miles"" ignores the amount of fuel used in the production. It is possible to cut down your food miles by buying tomatoes grown in Britain rather than those grown in Ghana; the difference is that the British ones will have been raised in heated greenhouses and the Ghanaian ones in the open sun.
What is the idea of ""food miles"" does provide, however, is the chance to cut out Third World countries from First World food markets. The number of miles traveled by our food should, as I see it, be regarded as a sign of the success of the global trade system, not a sign of damage to the environment.

A. a supporter of free global trade 
B. a member of the Food Commission

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation.

A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle.

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government.

Context: Decreasing grain prices along with growing costs of production means Chinese farmers are unlikely to see a significant rise in income next year. [:ZXXK]
China's economic planning chief Ma Kai expressed the concern as the government undertakes an ambitious program to improve rural people's lives.
Grain prices have been dropping since April; and prices of wheat, corn and rice fell 5 per cent from August to October compared with the same period last year, Ma, minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, told an annual meeting on development and reform held over the weekend.
Meanwhile, prices of production materials rose 9.1 per cent year on year during the first 10 months.
The situation makes it difficult to achieve a ""new socialist countryside,"" which was last week highlighted as a new concept and ""common action"" of the whole Party and nation.
Vice-Minister of Agriculture Yin Chengjie also said China's entry to the World Trade Organization also creates _ for income rises for the country's 780 million farmers.
Farmers' income is expected to increase by 5 per cent this year, hitting the target set by the central government at the beginning of this year.
Last year, per capita net income of Chinese farmers reached 2,936 yuan (US$362), up 6.8 per cent year on year, and the highest increase since 1997.
Ma also said China would continue to seek fast, steady economic growth in 2012 but more efforts will be made to deal with the challenges brought about by overheating in some industrial sectors  .

Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption

Context: Some Chinese shops have stopped selling Japanese goods in protest against Tokyo's approval of a school history book they say  _ Japan's militaristic past.
       It was not clear how many Chinese stores had stopped selling Japanese products, but one association official told Renters that the boycott had begun in Shanghai, the country's business center, and the northeast city of Shenyang.
       Chinese protests against Japan's bid for a permanent seat in the U.N. Security Council. Millions of Chinese have already signed an online demand against giving Japan a permanent seat.
       South Korea also has criticized the Japanese text book decision. The Korean English-language newspaper Korea Times ran an article on Monday criticizing that action.
       It said: ""A civic education text even has a picture of Tokto( ) as Japanese district on its cover. We cannot help but wonder how many countries in the world would be teaching their children in such wrong words.""
       It went on to say: ""The country is already a global power and should show regional leadership, not by force but by moral superiority. Tokyo doesn't appear to be reaching forward in this direction."" 
 Question:How many cities which led a boycott of the goods are listed in the passage? 
A. One.

Context: An environment group called the Food Commission is unhappy and disappointed because of the sales of bottled water from Japan. The water, it angrily argues in public, has traveled 10,000 "" _ "" before it reaches Western customers. ""Transporting water half-way across the world is surely the extremely stupid use of fuel when there is plenty of water in the UK."" It is also worried that we are wasting our fuel by buying prawns from Indonesia (7,000 food miles) and carrots from South Africa (5,900 food miles).
Counting the number of miles traveled by a product is a strange way of trying to tell the true situation of the environmental damage done by an industry. Most food is transported around the world on container ships that are extremely energy-efficient. It should be noted that a ton of butter transported 25 miles in a truck to a farmers' market does not necessarily use less fuel on its journey than a similar product transported hundreds of miles by sea, Besides, the idea of ""food miles"" ignores the amount of fuel used in the production. It is possible to cut down your food miles by buying tomatoes grown in Britain rather than those grown in Ghana; the difference is that the British ones will have been raised in heated greenhouses and the Ghanaian ones in the open sun.
What is the idea of ""food miles"" does provide, however, is the chance to cut out Third World countries from First World food markets. The number of miles traveled by our food should, as I see it, be regarded as a sign of the success of the global trade system, not a sign of damage to the environment. 
 Question:From the passage we know that the author is most probably  _  . 
A. a supporter of free global trade 
B. a member of the Food Commission 
C. a supporter of First World food markets 
D. a member of an energy development group

Context: As Apple tries to maintain its growth and success in China, the world's largest smart-phone market is becoming even more critical. Apple's shares  fell sharply as the company's earnings for the holiday quarter through December disappointed investors.
The sales of the iPhone, which include both the iPhone 5 and older models, came in at the low end of analysts' expectations, while the company's income plan for the second quarter was below analysts' forecasts, though Apple is known to give conservative   forecasts.
Som'6 analysts have said that for Apple to regain its growth, the company.needs a more aggressive strategy for markets, or more specifically for China, where the market for smart phones has been expanding more rapidly than anywhere else. In China, demand is particularly great for inexpensive phones that run on Android  operating system, sold by many Chinese phone makers as well as South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.
But Apple says it's already enjoying strong growth in China. ""We saw big growth in iPhones,""Chief Executive Tim Cook said. He said that the company has been quickly expanding its sales channels in China, including the number of Apple stores. ""This isn't nearly what we need, we're not even close to that, but we're making great progress. "" he said.
In China, a big missing piece for Apple is China Mobile Ltd. , the biggest local telecom carrier that doesn't yet sell the iPhone. Earlier this month, Mr. Cook met China Mobile Chairman Xi Guohua in Beijing and discussed cooperation, stirring hopes that the world's largest mobile carrier may soon start offering the iPhone.
Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is working on a lower-end iPhone that could launch as early as this year. But one possible challenge for Apple in China is that low-pricod Android-based phones are getting better in terms of quality. A report from CLSA in late November showed that many smart-phones sold at about 1,000 yuan ( $160) came with higher-reso-lution screens, better cameras and more powerful processors than phones at that price did a year earlier. 
 Question:What can we learn from the passage? 
A. Apple tends to offer a lower sales forecast. 
B. China Mobile Ltd began to team up with Apple. 
C. Cook is pessimistic about what Apple did in China. 
D. Apple didn't take measures to develop Chinese market.

Context: The rapid growth of Smartphones and electronic tablets is making the Internet favourite for Americans reading news, a report said.
News consumption online increased 17% last year from the year before. Television news, newspapers, radio and magazines all lost audience last year. For the first time, the number of people who get news online at least three times a week is larger than the number of people who get news from the newspapers.

Context: London has a new magazine.However,it is not printed on paper any more.Everyone who has a television can receive it because it is already on TV!
    In order to read this magazine,you need to have a decoder.Each page of it is numbered,so you have to dial a number to choose which subject you want to read about.You have a wide choice of topics to choose from-everything from cooking to the latest news.
    If you want to read some news,the first thing you have to do is to check at the index page which has an easy-to-remember page number,1 00 for example.From page 100,you can then choose from the news articles on page 101 to 109.From here,you will have to key in the numbers again.Then,the news will appear written across your screen.If you want to go out in the afternoon,you can press 181,and a brightly color1ed weather map will appear on the screen.But if you want to buy some cheap things,you can press 162 for a list of the week's best bargains.And whether you should drive or just take the train,you can simply press 189 for the traffic report.This new magazine on TV is very simple to use.But probably,the best thing about the service is that is being updated all the time.Journalists type new materials directly onto screen and the page of the magazine is replaced in minutes.
    London already has three services.One,transmitted by ITV ,is called ORACLE while the other two,on BBC,are called CEEFAX because they let you see facts.Although CEEFAX and ORACLE have been operating for some time, they have not been well publicized.BBC engineers do not think that their idea will ever replace books and newspapers because this new invention can't be taken with you wherever you go.But many people would agree that this is a breakthrough as great as the invention of printing, which could change not only our reading habits but also our lifestyles.

Context: When Denis Hennequin took over as the European boss of McDonald's in January 2004, the world's biggest restaurant chain was showing signs of recovery in America and Australia, but sales in Europe were sluggish or declining.One exception was France, where Mr.Hennequin had done a reliable job as head on the group's French subsidiary  to sell more Big Macs to his relatives, His task was to copy this success in all 41 of the European countries where anti-globalisers' favourite enemy operates.
So far Mr.Henncquin is doing well.Last year European sales increased by 5.8% and the number of customers by 3.4%, the best annual results in nearly 15 years.Europe accounted for 36% of the group's profits and for 28 of its sales.December was an especially good month as customers took to seasonal menu offerings in France and Britain, and to a promotion in Germany based on the game of Monopoly .
Mr.Hennequin's recipe for revival  is to be more open about his company's operations, to be ""locally relevant"", and to improve the experience of visiting his 6.400 restaurants. McDonaId's is blamed for making people fat, exploiting workers, treating animals cruelly, polluting the environment and simply for being American.Mr.Hennequin says he wants to engage in a dialogue with the public to address these concerns.

Context: China and Japan are respectively the world's secondandthirdlargest economies. In 2008, China-Japan trade grew to $266.4 billion, a rise of 12.5 percent on 2007, making China and Japan the top two-way trading partners. China was also the biggest destination for Japanese exports in 2009.
The relationship between China and Japan has been  _ at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge itswartimepast to the satisfaction of China. China joined other Asian countries, such asSouth Korea,North KoreaandSingapore, in criticizing Japanese history textbooks that whitenJapanese war crimesinWorld War II. They claimed that the rise ofmilitarismbecame evident in Japanese politics. Muchanti-Japanese emotion has risen, because of the increasing feelings ofChinese nationalismand former Prime MinisterJunichiro Koizumi's visits to theYasukuni Shrine . Although Koizumi openly declared---in a statement made on April 22, 2005 in Jakarta--- ""deep regret"" overJapan's wartime crimes, many Chinese observers regard the apology as insufficient and not consistent with the action.
Sino-Japan relations changed slightly after Shinzo Abebecame thePrime Minister of Japanin September 2006, and a joint historical study conducted by China and Japan released a report in 2010 which pointed toward new agreement on the issue ofWorld War II-era violent action.
However, there also remains the dispute  over the Diaoyu Islands, which resulted in clashes between Taiwanese (Chinese) protesters and the Japanese government in April 2005. The incident led to anti-Japanese protests and violence across Mainland China, from BeijingtoShanghai, laterGuangzhou,ShenzhenandShenyang. In August 2012, Hong Kong activists landed on one of the disputed Diaoyu Islands, and Japanese nationalists responded by landing on the island the following week. The incidents set off the largest-scale anti-Japanese protests in China for decades in which protesters vandalized Japanese shops and cars. On the 14th of September relations worsened even further in response to Japan's announcement of plans to buy the island from its private owners. The news resulted in the Chinese government sending six surveillance  ships to the islands and further anti-Japanese protests in which protesters attacked the Japanese embassies in Shanghai and Beijing. 
 Question:Which of the following can improve the Sino-Japan relations? 
A. Strengthening their economic tie. 
B. Reaching an agreement on their disputes. 
C. Stopping vandalizing Japanese shops and cars. 
D. Shinzo Abe becoming Japanese prime minister.

The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns.

He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand.

Context: As Apple tries to maintain its growth and success in China, the world's largest smart-phone market is becoming even more critical. Apple's shares  fell sharply as the company's earnings for the holiday quarter through December disappointed investors.
The sales of the iPhone, which include both the iPhone 5 and older models, came in at the low end of analysts' expectations, while the company's income plan for the second quarter was below analysts' forecasts, though Apple is known to give conservative   forecasts.
Som'6 analysts have said that for Apple to regain its growth, the company.needs a more aggressive strategy for markets, or more specifically for China, where the market for smart phones has been expanding more rapidly than anywhere else. In China, demand is particularly great for inexpensive phones that run on Android  operating system, sold by many Chinese phone makers as well as South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.
But Apple says it's already enjoying strong growth in China. ""We saw big growth in iPhones,""Chief Executive Tim Cook said. He said that the company has been quickly expanding its sales channels in China, including the number of Apple stores. ""This isn't nearly what we need, we're not even close to that, but we're making great progress. "" he said.
In China, a big missing piece for Apple is China Mobile Ltd. , the biggest local telecom carrier that doesn't yet sell the iPhone. Earlier this month, Mr. Cook met China Mobile Chairman Xi Guohua in Beijing and discussed cooperation, stirring hopes that the world's largest mobile carrier may soon start offering the iPhone.
Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is working on a lower-end iPhone that could launch as early as this year. But one possible challenge for Apple in China is that low-pricod Android-based phones are getting better in terms of quality. A report from CLSA in late November showed that many smart-phones sold at about 1,000 yuan ( $160) came with higher-reso-lution screens, better cameras and more powerful processors than phones at that price did a year earlier. 
 Question:What can we learn from the passage? 
A. Apple tends to offer a lower sales forecast. 
B. China Mobile Ltd began to team up with Apple. 
C. Cook is pessimistic about what Apple did in China. 
D. Apple didn't take measures to develop Chinese market.

Context: Salesman Ramesh lived in the southern part of India. He got his first assignment in the month of June, the start of the rainy season in the area. He was given a list of local laundry owners whom he had to approach and sell products to. He was scared and thought he wouldn't be able to fulfill the task, but he accepted the challenge as he had no other choice.
    The next day he started approaching the laundry owners, and within 15 days he got a really nice response. Most of them purchased his products, but they borrowed money from Ramesh to buy the products. Everyone promised to pay him back within the next 15 days.
    During the last week of June amidst heavy showers, he started visiting the laundry owners to collect money. Upon visiting half of them, he realized he hadn't collected a penny.
    After almost 14 days, on a bright sunny Monday morning, he started visiting the laundry owners once again. Suddenly, by noon Ramesh realized that he had collected the payments from almost 50% of the owners.
    He worked hard throughout the day, and by the end of the day he had completed 90% of his target for June and July. At last, he became the ""star performer"" for the months of June and July.
    Why did the laundry owners look at the sky and tell him to come the next day when Ramesh visited them? He went to a laundry owner and asked him the question. The owner said, ""This is the month of the rainy season and we have to wash the clothes, dry them off and iron them before handing them over to customers. If the sun doesn't shine, how can we dry our clothes and earn money to pay you back?"" Ramesh then realized that it was his patience and endurance that kept him going and ultimately helped him achieve success.
    Like Ramesh, each one of us should realize that apart from being honest and hard-working, if we can keep our patience, we are inching up the ladder of success. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE? 
A. June is the start of the rainy season in the southern part of India. 
B. To sell products, Ramesh helped his customers to wash clothes. 
C. Ramesh became the ""star performer"" for the next three months. 
D. A minority of customers paid for the products using the money from Ramesh.

Context: Decreasing grain prices along with growing costs of production means Chinese farmers are unlikely to see a significant rise in income next year. [:ZXXK]
China's economic planning chief Ma Kai expressed the concern as the government undertakes an ambitious program to improve rural people's lives.
Grain prices have been dropping since April; and prices of wheat, corn and rice fell 5 per cent from August to October compared with the same period last year, Ma, minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, told an annual meeting on development and reform held over the weekend.
Meanwhile, prices of production materials rose 9.1 per cent year on year during the first 10 months.
The situation makes it difficult to achieve a ""new socialist countryside,"" which was last week highlighted as a new concept and ""common action"" of the whole Party and nation.
Vice-Minister of Agriculture Yin Chengjie also said China's entry to the World Trade Organization also creates _ for income rises for the country's 780 million farmers.
Farmers' income is expected to increase by 5 per cent this year, hitting the target set by the central government at the beginning of this year.
Last year, per capita net income of Chinese farmers reached 2,936 yuan (US$362), up 6.8 per cent year on year, and the highest increase since 1997.
Ma also said China would continue to seek fast, steady economic growth in 2012 but more efforts will be made to deal with the challenges brought about by overheating in some industrial sectors  .

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT.""

News consumption online increased 17% last year from the year before. Television news, newspapers, radio and magazines all lost audience last year. For the first time, the number of people who get news online at least three times a week is larger than the number of people who get news from the newspapers.

Context: TOKYO-- At first glance, Japanese cellphones are young people's favorites, with elegant design and quick access to the Internet. However, despite years of competition in overseas markets, Japan's cellphone makers have little presence beyond the country's shores.
The only Japanese cellphone maker with any meaningful global share is Sony Ericsson, and that company is a London-based joint venture between a Japanese electronics maker and a Swedish telecommunications firm.
And Sony Ericsson has been hit by big losses. Its market share was just 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009, behind Nokia of Finland, Samsung Electronics and LG of South Korea, and Motorola of Illinois.
This year, Mr Natsuno, who developed a popular wireless Internet service called i-Mode, invited some of the best minds in the field to debate how Japanese cellphones could go global.
""The most amazing thing about Japan is that even the average person out there will have a very advanced phone, ""said Mr Natsuno. Japan has 100 million users of advanced third-generation smart phones, twice the number of the United States, a much larger market. Many Japanese rely on their phones, not a PC, for Internet access.
Indeed, Japanese cellphone makers thought they had positioned themselves to dominate the age of digital data. But they were a little too clever. In the 1990s, they set a standard for the second-generation network that was refused everywhere else. Then Japan quickly adopted a third-generation standard in 2001. However, it made Japanese phones too advanced for most markets.
Several Japanese companies are now considering a push into overseas markets, including NEC. Panasonic, Sharp, Toshiba and Fujitsu are said to be planning similar moves.
""Japanese cellphone makers need to either look overseas, or exit the business"", said Kenshi Tazaki, a managing vice president at the consulting firm Gartner Japan. 
 Question:Which of the following would be the best title for the passage? 
A. Japanese cellphone companies are unsuccessful. 
B. Japan has more cellphone users than the US. 
C. Japanese cellphone industry intends to expand overseas markets. 
D. Going global--a difficult task for Japanese companies. 
 Answer: C
Context: ""Any time! Any where! Decades ago there was no such thing"" - ""Communication"".
Then, September 7th 1987, the global system for mobile communication or GSM was born. And international agreements that laid out the standards, regulations and practices gave rise to a global mobile phone industry.
To be honest, the world's first mobiles were not so attractive and the range of effectiveness wasn't very good. But they became a must-have among those wealthy people who could afford that. However, by advantage of GSM which has many different elements to it, we can all enjoy the ability to go around the world in 217 countries, land in that country and know that a phone would work.
There are other cell phone systems using different technology in the world. The majority of the United States and parts of South America have been using something called CDMA which is very rare in Europe. In some Asian countries like China, GSM and CDMA both exist at the same time. But the GSM Association claims 85% of the global mobile phone market. They estimated there are now about 2.5 billion different users who make more than 7 trillion minutes of calls everyday, and that's not all.
20 years later, the mobile phone is so much more than just a phone. You can use it to send text messages, take pictures, show video, even surf the internet.
""The phone itself is involved from just being a communication tool, to be a tool for round-the-clock connectivity, you can not live without it even in a minute."" Mobile consultant Nick Lane also points out with so many customized styles and features, your mobile phone will become a symbol of you.
Where will the global mobile phone industry be in another 20 years? Certainly, there will be more connections than better coverage. As for where else technology will take us, one can only imagine. 
 Question:From this passage, we can infer that   _  . 
A. as soon as the first mobiles appeared, they became popular and many people have one 
B. with a GSM mobile phone, you can make a phone call in most parts of the USA 
C. there are only two cell phone systems in the whole world: GSM and CDMA 
D. most of the mobile phone users in the world now are using the GSM mobile phone

Context: Decreasing grain prices along with growing costs of production means Chinese farmers are unlikely to see a significant rise in income next year. [:ZXXK]
China's economic planning chief Ma Kai expressed the concern as the government undertakes an ambitious program to improve rural people's lives.
Grain prices have been dropping since April; and prices of wheat, corn and rice fell 5 per cent from August to October compared with the same period last year, Ma, minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, told an annual meeting on development and reform held over the weekend.
Meanwhile, prices of production materials rose 9.1 per cent year on year during the first 10 months.
The situation makes it difficult to achieve a ""new socialist countryside,"" which was last week highlighted as a new concept and ""common action"" of the whole Party and nation.
Vice-Minister of Agriculture Yin Chengjie also said China's entry to the World Trade Organization also creates _ for income rises for the country's 780 million farmers.
Farmers' income is expected to increase by 5 per cent this year, hitting the target set by the central government at the beginning of this year.
Last year, per capita net income of Chinese farmers reached 2,936 yuan (US$362), up 6.8 per cent year on year, and the highest increase since 1997.
Ma also said China would continue to seek fast, steady economic growth in 2012 but more efforts will be made to deal with the challenges brought about by overheating in some industrial sectors  .
(from China Daily, December 5, 2011) 
 Question:From1997 to 2011, the highest increase in farmers' income was achieved in   _  . 
A. 2009 
B. 2010 
C. 2011 
D. 2008 
 Answer: B
Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----. 
A. planted less corn 
B. planted morn crops 
C. planted morn wheat 
D. earned more money

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT."" 
 Question:The price of the knives was cut down by half because   _  . 
A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap 
D. the knives were produced in one factory

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .

A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer

Context: The organization representing British universities has expressed concern about the potential effect of tuition fees after figures showed a drop of more than 6% in student applications with less than a month to go before the deadline for 2013 applications.
Data from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) showed there were 265,784 university applications by UK-based candiates up to 17 Decemeber, 6.3% down on the parallel period in the admissions cycle the year before. While this is less than the 8.4% year-on-uear fall seen in earlier Ucas figures, released in mid-November, the coming January deadline makes it ever more likely that the total 2013 applicant figure will see a second sizeable fall following the introduction of annual fees of up to PS9,000.
Nicola Dandridge, the chairman of Universities UK, said : ""However, we must be concerned about any drops in the numbers applying to university and in particular, we must look closely at how the increase in graduate contributions in England may be affecting the decisions of promising students. However ,the December figures show a drop in numbers across the UK, suggesting that it is not only a question of tuition fees in England putting off from applying.""
A report of the Uncas figures to mid-December shows a 6.5% fall for applicants in England and 11.7% for those in Wales, with smaller drops of 3.9% for Scotland and 0.5% for Nortern Ireland. Scotiish students at home insitiutions pay on fees, while those from Nothern Ireland have fees capped to PS3,575 for Northern Irish universities.
Dandridge added: ""No one should be put off applying to university because of worries about finance.""
""It is important that no one is put off applying to university because they do not have information about the student support available to them. Most new students don't need to pay directly. There will be more financial support for those from poorer families and everyone will make lower loan repayments thatn they do now once they are in well paid jobs."" 
 Question:Compared with the previous year, the fall in student applications is  _  . 
A. 3.9% 
B. 6% 
C. 6.3% 
D. 8.4% 
 Answer: C
Context: It is ""one of the few bright spots in the Chinese economy,"" says Zeng Ming. He is talking about e-commerce. Mr Zeng, the chief strategy officer for Alibaba, a giant Chinese Internet firm, predicts that digital transactions on his firm's platforms will top l trillion yuan ($159 billion) this year-more than Amazon's and eBay's combined. That is a bold claim, but consider what happened on Singles Sunday.
Invented a few years ago by students and seized upon by digital marketers, this festival for lonely hearts falls annually on the  llth day of the llth month (since l is the loneliest number).It is like St Valentine's Day, only worse. Singletons shower each other with tender gifts: a barrage of pearls; a storm of sweets.
This November llth they spent a surprising 19 billion yuan on Alibaba's online platforms-a fourfold increase on a year ago, and more than double what Americans spent online last Cyber Monday (the Monday after Thanksgiving, when retailers urge Americans to shop online). About 100m purchases were logged, accounting for 80% of the packages shipped that day. Couriers  were buried in parcels.
So life is good for China's e-tailers, then? Not exactly. The number of digital marketers is increasing and online sales are booming. Consumers are enjoying lower prices, better service and more variety. The problem? The pressure on profits in Chinese e-commerce is worse than in America, reckons Elinor Leung of CLSA, a broker. ""Almost no one makes money,"" she says.
The fiercest battles are being fought between online retailers and their bricks-and-mortar  rivals.Dangdang, a firm. that resembles Amazon,.and 360buy, another online retailer, have cut prices fiercely. Tencent, a cash-rich online giant known for its instant-messaging software, is splashing out to win market share. 360buy has also just raised $400m from investors to do the same. But it is unclear how much longer such firms can burn through capital. 
 Question:According to Zeng Ming, this year Alibaba will_. 
A. outweigh Amazon and eBay in worldwide influence 
B. rank top among all the Internet firms 
C. have more than 159 billion dollars' sale 
D. create another sales miracle just like the one on Singles Day

Context: On March 5, 2009, Michael Jackson stood in front of crowds of fans. Before screaming fans, he pronounced with pumping arms: ""This is it!""
A few months later, Jackson was dead. With the late pop star's return to radio, television and the cultural events, Forbes judges that Jackson has made $90 million since his death June 25. This figure is based on his royalties  from album sales, radio play, rights to his name and royalties from his stock in the Sony/ATV music catalog  .
Jackson's music was his most easily-seen source in the last months. ""Nothing increases the value of an artist than death ... an untimely death,"" says Barry Massarsky, a music industry economist.
The music's immediate value was clear. Since June, Jackson has sold more than 5.9 million albums in the U.S. and another 4.5 million overseas. In the first weeks after his death, there were 5.6 million single downloads across North America, Europe and Australia. Jackson recently has three of the top 20 best-selling albums of the year in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan. His 2003 hits album Number Ones is the best seller of the year, beating Taylor Swift's Fearless.
More than 500,000 Jackson ringtones and 100,000 music videos were sold. In the week following his death, songs by The Jackson 5, The Jacksons and Michael were played over 100,000 times on the radio, according to Nielsen BDS.
Jackson's estate will likely see more money by the end of this year, as it has rights to some of the profits from This Is It as well as the two-disc album of the same name. The estate will share 90% of the film profits with AEG.
Ticket sales from an exhibit opening in London will also contribute a likely profit. Hundreds of Jackson's personal belongings-his L.A. Rolls Royce etc-will remain on show for three months at the O2 for fans willing to shell out $25 for a view.
The pop singer bought ATV Publishing, for $47.5 million in 1985. Ten years later, he sold the catalog to Sony for $95 million and took a 50% stock in Sony/ATV, which is now worth about $1.7 to $2 billion. So he still owned half the Sony/ATV catalog at his death.
Jackson's future earning potential is based on his stock in valuable music and as well as the value of his image . As many musicians, actors and artists before him, Jackson's fame could have a long tail on the market with allowable products, advertising and entertainment events. 
 Question:All the following is true EXCEPT that   _  . 
A. Rolls Royce is now for show and will finally be sold 
B. Jackson has sold 10.4 million albums since June 
C. Jackson's L. 
D. Jackson's stock in music and his image will keep on earning money in the future

Context: A U.S. dad quit his job, giving up a massive salary, after his 10-year-old daughter gave him a 22-point list outlining all the events he missed so far during the year. As the CEO of the $2 trillion global investment fund PIMCO, Mohamed El-Erian shocked the finance industry when he quit in January.
El-Erian said it was about a year ago when he was repeatedly asking his daughter to brush her teeth, but she wasn't listening. When he asked her why, she responded with a list of 22 milestones he had missed: like the first day of school and the first soccer game of the season.
""And the school year wasn't yet over,"" El-Erian wrote. ""I felt awful and got defensive: I had a good excuse for each missed event! Travel, important meetings, and urgent phone call, sudden to-dos. But it dawned on me that I was missing an infinitely more important point. My work-life balance had gotten out of whack, and the imbalance was hurting my very special relationship with my daughter. I was not making enough time for her."" El-Erian explained he was struggling with the same thing so many parents do--work-life balance.
Dads who are quitting their profit-making jobs to improve work-life balance is a subject that is getting more traction as some high-profile executive have recently written about their experiences.
Last month, former MongoDB CEO Max Schireson wrote a blog post for Time about his decision to step down from the company's top job. He wrote that he struggled to make time for his three children because he was flying around half a million kilometres a year for work.
""I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car, or when my son had an emergency surgery,"" Schireson wrote.
On an overnight flight to Texas he woke up in Arizona to discover the plane made an emergency landing and some traumatized crew members had to be replaced. He decided it was time to address his work-life balance.
Quitting is something El-Erian and Schireson were financially able to do, but El-Erian recognizes most people don't have this luxury. He hopes companies will pay attention to improving work-life balance for their employees.
El-Erian now manages ""a portfolio of part-time jobs"" that don't require as much travel. He alternates mornings with his wife taking their daughter to school and he often picks her up from school.
""So far, it's been the right decision for me,"" he wrote. ""I'm so grateful that this is providing me greater opportunity to experience key moments in my daughter's life before they're all too quickly gone."" 
 Question:El-Erian resigned from PIMCO mainly because   _  . 
A. his daughter has been missing him badly 
B. he was getting bored with the endless flights 
C. he hoped to get his daughter to listen to her 
D. he wanted to experience his daughter's milestones

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.

Context: As Apple tries to maintain its growth and success in China, the world's largest smart-phone market is becoming even more critical. Apple's shares  fell sharply as the company's earnings for the holiday quarter through December disappointed investors.
The sales of the iPhone, which include both the iPhone 5 and older models, came in at the low end of analysts' expectations, while the company's income plan for the second quarter was below analysts' forecasts, though Apple is known to give conservative   forecasts.
Som'6 analysts have said that for Apple to regain its growth, the company.needs a more aggressive strategy for markets, or more specifically for China, where the market for smart phones has been expanding more rapidly than anywhere else. In China, demand is particularly great for inexpensive phones that run on Android  operating system, sold by many Chinese phone makers as well as South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.
But Apple says it's already enjoying strong growth in China. ""We saw big growth in iPhones,""Chief Executive Tim Cook said. He said that the company has been quickly expanding its sales channels in China, including the number of Apple stores. ""This isn't nearly what we need, we're not even close to that, but we're making great progress. "" he said.
In China, a big missing piece for Apple is China Mobile Ltd. , the biggest local telecom carrier that doesn't yet sell the iPhone. Earlier this month, Mr. Cook met China Mobile Chairman Xi Guohua in Beijing and discussed cooperation, stirring hopes that the world's largest mobile carrier may soon start offering the iPhone.
Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is working on a lower-end iPhone that could launch as early as this year. But one possible challenge for Apple in China is that low-pricod Android-based phones are getting better in terms of quality. A report from CLSA in late November showed that many smart-phones sold at about 1,000 yuan ( $160) came with higher-reso-lution screens, better cameras and more powerful processors than phones at that price did a year earlier. 
 Question:What can we learn from the passage? 
A. Apple tends to offer a lower sales forecast. 
B. China Mobile Ltd began to team up with Apple. 
C. Cook is pessimistic about what Apple did in China. 
D. Apple didn't take measures to develop Chinese market.

Context: Decreasing grain prices along with growing costs of production means Chinese farmers are unlikely to see a significant rise in income next year. [:ZXXK]
China's economic planning chief Ma Kai expressed the concern as the government undertakes an ambitious program to improve rural people's lives.
Grain prices have been dropping since April; and prices of wheat, corn and rice fell 5 per cent from August to October compared with the same period last year, Ma, minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, told an annual meeting on development and reform held over the weekend.
Meanwhile, prices of production materials rose 9.1 per cent year on year during the first 10 months.
The situation makes it difficult to achieve a ""new socialist countryside,"" which was last week highlighted as a new concept and ""common action"" of the whole Party and nation.
Vice-Minister of Agriculture Yin Chengjie also said China's entry to the World Trade Organization also creates _ for income rises for the country's 780 million farmers.
Farmers' income is expected to increase by 5 per cent this year, hitting the target set by the central government at the beginning of this year.
Last year, per capita net income of Chinese farmers reached 2,936 yuan (US$362), up 6.8 per cent year on year, and the highest increase since 1997.
Ma also said China would continue to seek fast, steady economic growth in 2012 but more efforts will be made to deal with the challenges brought about by overheating in some industrial sectors  .
(from China Daily, December 5, 2011) 
 Question:From1997 to 2011, the highest increase in farmers' income was achieved in   _  .

Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption 
 Answer: D
Context: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the eleventh largest nation in Europe. England, Wales and Scotland make up the island of Great Britain, which takes up most of the Britain Isles. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are mountainous. The highest mountain is Ben Nevis in Scotland. Plains and valleys cover much of England. The British climate is mild.
About 58 million people live in the United Kingdom. Few other countries are so crowded. Four out of five people live in cities such as Belfast, Glasgow, and London. London is the capital. Great Britain grows half of the food it needs. Its industries help to pay for the food that is bought from abroad. The United Kingdom manufactures a wide range of goods. Service industries, such as tourism, that provide services rather than producing goods, are increasing. Traditional industries, such as coal mining, are declining. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the statements is true? 
A. Great Britain grows all of the food it needs. 
B. The United Kingdom manufactures a narrow range of goods. 
C. The speed of tourism in UK is increasing faster than producing goods. 
D. The coal mining is also increasing fast. 
 Answer: C
Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: On March 5, 2009, Michael Jackson stood in front of crowds of fans. Before screaming fans, he pronounced with pumping arms: ""This is it!""
A few months later, Jackson was dead. With the late pop star's return to radio, television and the cultural events, Forbes judges that Jackson has made $90 million since his death June 25. This figure is based on his royalties  from album sales, radio play, rights to his name and royalties from his stock in the Sony/ATV music catalog  .
Jackson's music was his most easily-seen source in the last months. ""Nothing increases the value of an artist than death ... an untimely death,"" says Barry Massarsky, a music industry economist.
The music's immediate value was clear. Since June, Jackson has sold more than 5.9 million albums in the U.S. and another 4.5 million overseas. In the first weeks after his death, there were 5.6 million single downloads across North America, Europe and Australia. Jackson recently has three of the top 20 best-selling albums of the year in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan. His 2003 hits album Number Ones is the best seller of the year, beating Taylor Swift's Fearless.
More than 500,000 Jackson ringtones and 100,000 music videos were sold. In the week following his death, songs by The Jackson 5, The Jacksons and Michael were played over 100,000 times on the radio, according to Nielsen BDS.
Jackson's estate will likely see more money by the end of this year, as it has rights to some of the profits from This Is It as well as the two-disc album of the same name. The estate will share 90% of the film profits with AEG.
Ticket sales from an exhibit opening in London will also contribute a likely profit. Hundreds of Jackson's personal belongings-his L.A. Rolls Royce etc-will remain on show for three months at the O2 for fans willing to shell out $25 for a view.
The pop singer bought ATV Publishing, for $47.5 million in 1985. Ten years later, he sold the catalog to Sony for $95 million and took a 50% stock in Sony/ATV, which is now worth about $1.7 to $2 billion. So he still owned half the Sony/ATV catalog at his death.
Jackson's future earning potential is based on his stock in valuable music and as well as the value of his image . As many musicians, actors and artists before him, Jackson's fame could have a long tail on the market with allowable products, advertising and entertainment events. 
 Question:All the following is true EXCEPT that   _  . 
A. Rolls Royce is now for show and will finally be sold 
B. Jackson has sold 10.4 million albums since June 
C. Jackson's L. 
D. Jackson's stock in music and his image will keep on earning money in the future

Context: An environment group called the Food Commission is unhappy and disappointed because of the sales of bottled water from Japan. The water, it angrily argues in public, has traveled 10,000 "" _ "" before it reaches Western customers. ""Transporting water half-way across the world is surely the extremely stupid use of fuel when there is plenty of water in the UK."" It is also worried that we are wasting our fuel by buying prawns from Indonesia (7,000 food miles) and carrots from South Africa (5,900 food miles).
Counting the number of miles traveled by a product is a strange way of trying to tell the true situation of the environmental damage done by an industry. Most food is transported around the world on container ships that are extremely energy-efficient. It should be noted that a ton of butter transported 25 miles in a truck to a farmers' market does not necessarily use less fuel on its journey than a similar product transported hundreds of miles by sea, Besides, the idea of ""food miles"" ignores the amount of fuel used in the production. It is possible to cut down your food miles by buying tomatoes grown in Britain rather than those grown in Ghana; the difference is that the British ones will have been raised in heated greenhouses and the Ghanaian ones in the open sun.
What is the idea of ""food miles"" does provide, however, is the chance to cut out Third World countries from First World food markets. The number of miles traveled by our food should, as I see it, be regarded as a sign of the success of the global trade system, not a sign of damage to the environment. 
 Question:From the passage we know that the author is most probably  _  . 
A. a supporter of free global trade 
B. a member of the Food Commission 
C. a supporter of First World food markets 
D. a member of an energy development group

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: The rapid growth of Smartphones and electronic tablets is making the Internet favourite for Americans reading news, a report said.
News consumption online increased 17% last year from the year before. Television news, newspapers, radio and magazines all lost audience last year. For the first time, the number of people who get news online at least three times a week is larger than the number of people who get news from the newspapers. TV news has been the most popular since the 1960s. It has replaced the afternoon newspapers. But now the online news seems to be more popular than the TV news.
People are used to having the Internet available on phones or small tablets. In December, 2010, 41% of Americans said they got most of their news on the Internet, more than double the 17% who said that a year earlier, the report said. In January, 2011, 7% of Americans owned electronic tablets, nearly double what it was three months earlier. It was the fastest-growing new digital technology, ahead of mobile phones when they were introduced. The online ad income was expected to surpass print newspaper ad income for the first time in 2010.
The news business used to be the intermediary . You needed newspapers and TV stations to reach your customers. In this age of the computer, it's the software developers that you need.

 Answer: B
Context: As Apple tries to maintain its growth and success in China, the world's largest smart-phone market is becoming even more critical. Apple's shares  fell sharply as the company's earnings for the holiday quarter through December disappointed investors.
The sales of the iPhone, which include both the iPhone 5 and older models, came in at the low end of analysts' expectations, while the company's income plan for the second quarter was below analysts' forecasts, though Apple is known to give conservative   forecasts.
Som'6 analysts have said that for Apple to regain its growth, the company.needs a more aggressive strategy for markets, or more specifically for China, where the market for smart phones has been expanding more rapidly than anywhere else. In China, demand is particularly great for inexpensive phones that run on Android  operating system, sold by many Chinese phone makers as well as South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.
But Apple says it's already enjoying strong growth in China. ""We saw big growth in iPhones,""Chief Executive Tim Cook said. He said that the company has been quickly expanding its sales channels in China, including the number of Apple stores. ""This isn't nearly what we need, we're not even close to that, but we're making great progress. "" he said.
In China, a big missing piece for Apple is China Mobile Ltd. , the biggest local telecom carrier that doesn't yet sell the iPhone. Earlier this month, Mr. Cook met China Mobile Chairman Xi Guohua in Beijing and discussed cooperation, stirring hopes that the world's largest mobile carrier may soon start offering the iPhone.
Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is working on a lower-end iPhone that could launch as early as this year. But one possible challenge for Apple in China is that low-pricod Android-based phones are getting better in terms of quality. A report from CLSA in late November showed that many smart-phones sold at about 1,000 yuan ( $160) came with higher-reso-lution screens, better cameras and more powerful processors than phones at that price did a year earlier. 
 Question:What can we learn from the passage? 
A. Apple tends to offer a lower sales forecast. 
B. China Mobile Ltd began to team up with Apple. 
C. Cook is pessimistic about what Apple did in China. 
D. Apple didn't take measures to develop Chinese market.

Context: Doubt usually comes along when companies talk very proudly how socially responsible they are, but Nike's decision to publish its entire list of contract suppliers on the Internet is harder to ignore. Nike's move opens a new front in companies' efforts to face their critics.
As Nike states in its latest corporate responsibility report, it is often hard to confirm exactly what is happening at about 800 factories that make its footwear and clothing under contract, many of which are remote.
Nike is hoping other companies will publish their factory lists, too. Hannah Jones, Nike's vice - president for corporate responsibility, says Nike would like to see the best - run contract factories using their social position as suppliers to the big brands to try to get more work.
Nike's approach moves corporate responsibility into its third age. The first age was corporate philanthropy - companies donating money to various community projects. The $170,   000,000 that Wal - Mart gave in charitable donations last year is a good example. Of course, some critics oppose even this form of corporate generosity , arguing that companies should concentrate on making profits, leaving it to shareholders to decide what charitable donations to make.
Corporate responsibility's second age was reputation management and risk avoidance. Second - age corporate responsibility supporters believe agreement with the wider community can warn a company of future risks in advance.
Nike is now trying to go a stage further. The company says it sees corporate responsibility as a way of improving its performance rather than just protecting its reputation. Factories which ensure that workers are registered  for social - security benefits often become more productive as a result. Attention to one aspect of staff management often leads to improvement in others.
If other companies publish supplier lists, they can together work out common standards, Nike says. At present, different companies have different standards, which make life difficult for the many factories that produce for more than one brand. If other companies published suppliers' locations, they could work out common standards and save money by relying on one another's checks. 
 Question:What effect could Nike's action have on its contract suppliers? 
A. Their managers will win promotion they desire. 
B. They will get donations from big brands easily. 
C. There's no need for their factories to be checked. 
D. They may have more opportunities to make money.

In this way David saved a few cents here and a few cents there, and by the end of the year he had saved several hundred dollars.

""About two minutes,"" the dentist answered. ""Forty dollars for two minutes' work!"" he shouted, ""That's robbery  ."" The dentist smiled. ""You're right,"" she said. ""Thank you for telling me. I'll pull your tooth out very slowly. How about if I take half an hour?""

Context: News that Microsoft was making a $44.6 billion bid to buy Yahoo was greeted with heated discussion by many Internet users on Friday. Here are some responses:
Mark Galeassi of Kansas City, Missouri
This is the best move for both parties. Yahoo has the ideas and Microsoft has the money to finally market these ideas correctly. Microsoft and Yahoo are a perfect fit and the deal will be good for consumers.
Scott G of New Jersey
I was a Yahoo user for years along with Hotmail from Microsoft. Then Google came along: Google Earth, Google Toolbar and Gmail. Google is so innovative   with everything they do. Yahoo and Microsoft... same old story... I don't think the merger   will do anything for either company except improve the Yahoo shareholders' bank accounts.
Michael Glosser of Estero, Florida
Right now, Yahoo offers a lot of features and tools at no cost for all different levels of Internet users. Microsoft seeks nothing but profit. Undoubtedly, they'll do nothing other than find ways to start removing Yahoo's formerly non-priced features. Microsoft's greed will ruin the great thing that Yahoo currently is.
Toni Suarez of Hacienda Heights, California
Perhaps it would bring better high technology innovations to e-mail and help in researching and developing a better Internet!
Antonio Simmons of Parkville, Maryland
Microsoft purchasing Yahoo would be nothing more than an attempt from Microsoft to further impose upon the users their poor-quality software and obtain more wealth for the company. In my opinion, they will never be able to compete with Google because Yahoo and Microsoft's current search engines are too inferior   to compete. Even if combined, they still lack. 
 Question:In the opinion of Scott G ,   _  . 
A. the merger will contribute to Microsoft 
B. Yahoo and Microsoft are lacking in innovation 
C. Google is getting short of management experience 
D. the merger will allow Microsoft to overtake Google

Context: There is no doubt that Apple is well aware of the increased competition in the market and could be in a hurry to put another device out there, said Ramon Llamas, senior research analyst at IDC Mobile Devices Technology and Trends. Given its history with product launches and business policy, though, Apple probably isn't going to rush an iPhone release simply to put it on shelves, he said.
""If you're Tim Cook (CEO of Apple), you're thinking if you want to pay more attention to how to keep growing that bottom line and keep investors happy, or continue with the same approach from Apple, which is do what we can do and manage products and releases in the best way they can work for us. Apple usually does things in their own time ,and I'm having a hard time buying this May or June timeline."" Llamas told Mac News World.
While it,s probable that Apple is definitely in a testing stage for its next smartphone , consumers likely have a standard wait for the finished product, said Colin Gibbs, analyst at GigaOm Pro.
""It typically takes a year or longer to create a state-of-the-art smartphone, so no one should be surprised Apple is in the testing stages with the next iPhone. And while it's possible that Apple could launch the next iPhone this spring or summer, I'm not expecting to see it until a little later in the year,"" he told Mac News World.
When it does launch, though, it could be in a variety of colors, said Gibbs. ""Apple has already tested the waters with releasing colored devices when it revamped(,)its iPod line last fall, so it's not too much of a stretch to believe it would want the new twist with its smartphone, as well"".
""I wouldn't be surprised if the new iPhone becomes available in some new colors,'' he said. ""That could be done pretty cheaply ,and it would give Apple a new marketing angle."" 
 Question:As for the next iPhone, Colin Gibbs didn't mention  _ 
A. the stage of its being tested 
B. the rough time of its being released 
C. the wide variety of its color 
D. the function to be improved

Context: Scientist Florence Wambugu works with farmers in Kenya, a country in East Africa. She helps them grow bigger and better crops. Wambugu is especially interested in finding simple ways to produce more food.
In the past ten years, Wambugu has spent much of her time studying sweet potatoes, which are an important food in her part of Kenya. A virus   kept attacking the plants. It stopped the sweet potatoes from growing well. Because of the virus, some farmers lost three quarters of their crops.
Wambugu went to war against the virus. Her research for a way to save the sweet potatoes led to a lab in St. Louis, Missouri.
The lab mainly works on genes  , the chemical ""computer programs"" found in the cells of living things. Genes tell a plant to produce pink flowers or an animal to grow black hair. Now scientists have found ways to move genes from one living thing to another. That process is called genetic engineering.
Wambugu spent three years in the lab. As a result, she created a sweet potato plant that could fight off the virus. Wambugu tested her research in Kenya, and her plants produced wonderful sweet potatoes.
That's just the beginning, Wambugu believes. Genetically modified   foods, she thinks, could help farmers in poor countries grow badly needed crops, thus, fewer people will go hungry. 
 Question:What caused Wambugu to set up a lab in St. Louis, Missouri? 
A. Her wish to save sweet potatoes in Kenya. 
B. Her great interest in genetic engineering. 
C. Her love for sweet potatoes. 
D. Her interest in plant life. 
 Answer: A
Context: The Future of Technology
William, a businessman, arrives in a foreign airport. He doesn't show his passport. Instead, a machine in the wall reads the computer chip in his arm. This contains information about him: his name, age, and I.D number. He exits the airport, and a car door opens when it ""sees"" him. The car takes him to his hotel. His room ""knows"" he has entered the building and it ""reads"" his body. He is cold, so the room becomes warmer. William then watches a business presentation on a video wall. When he takes a bath, the presentation ""follows him and continues on the bathroom wall. Finally, the room plays music to help him sleep. It turns off the music when it ""sees"" him sleeping.
William doesn't exist, and none of this is real. But it might be soon. ""In five to ten years, computing and communications are going to be free and everywhere, in your walls, in your car, on your body,' says Victor Zue, leader of Project Oxygen.
Project Oxygen has one big idea: to create better relationships between machines and people. The dream is that computer will learn to understand what people want.
So, what changes will there be at work? Firstly, the building will know where everyone is, all the time. You want to talk to someone? Type the person's name on the nearest computer. It will show you a map of the building and exactly where this person is. You then call this person, who picks up the nearest telephone, also shown on the computer. If he or she is busy with a client or in a meeting, the computer will tell you.
Is all this really possible? Visit the Siebel Center, Illinois and see for yourself: computers in the doors and walls, cameras everywhere, the technology of the future, but here today. 
 Question:The computer chip in William's arm contains his information except  _  . 
A. his name 
B. his age 
C. his I. 
D. his job

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

Context: Is it time to kick Russia out of the BRICs  ? If so, it may end up sounding like a famous ball-point pen maker-BIC. An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device ,the BRICs, should really be the BICs.
""Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?"" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreigh Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of ""The Russian Balance Sheet"", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes:
""The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas. ""
Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing
far better than Russia.
But the BRICs are not just about economy. As is mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while around 80 percent is for the other three.
At very least, however, Russia's economic underperformance and stock market outperfoumance does suggest it is indeed one of the group. 
 Question:According to Aslund, Russia shouldn't be a BRIC partly because  _  . 
A. Russia's economic performance is far worse than the other three 
B. Russia's leaders are not good at managing economy 
C. Russia has taken effective measures to improve its economy 
D. Russia will no longer attract investors from other countries

Context: There are stock markets   in large cities in many countries. Stock markets in Paris,
London, Tokyo, Shanghai and New York are among the largest and most well-known. The stock, also called stock exchange,  is a place where people can buy or sell shares of a factory or  company. And each share means certain ownership  of a factory or company.
Different people go to stock markets. Some are rich, who want to get more money than they
have. Others are not very rich, who buy stocks to try to become rich. Still others buy stocks as

do badly. Then the stocks will go down, and the investors will lose money. The stock may go up or down for a number of untold reasons. Everyone wants the stock to go up, but sometimes even if a factory or company does a good job, the stock may still go down.
Going to the stock market is often like gambling  . All want to make money by
""gambling' in the stock market. Factories and companies that need money are pleased that so many people are ready to ""gamble"". Indeed, the stock market is an attractive  but
part of the business world.

Context: Many American women are earning money outside their homes today. Among women who are eighteen to sixty-four years old, more than fifty per cent have jobs.
    In general, working women have had more education then those who stay at home. Of those who work, thirty-two per cent have attended college, compared with twenty per cent of those who do not have jobs.
    Among women with jobs, eight out of ten drive a car to work, and eight per cent took a vacation a way from home during the past year. Much of their traveling was by air.
    These figures come from a report which was written for advertisers. The report gives advertisers a new picture of women today. For instance, it tells advertisers that fifty-one per cent of all American women have traveled by air--along with fifty-nine per cent of all American men.
    The lesson for American business is that many women now have other interests in addition to their homes. They like advertisements which show women in office, planes, and cars.

A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B
Context: In recent years, the price of gas has been rising sharply, and people have made many adjustments.
There was, for a time, considerable unemployment in the auto industry, and three quarters of the garages and service stations have gone out of business. However; the bicycle and motor-scooter business has flourished ; and many people have found employment there: Now that Federal Motors has brought out its new Lilliput, which travels forty miles on a gallon, the auto business is picking up again. The factories that haven't switched over to two-wheel transportation are working on their new smaller models. There is talk, too, about bringing out new steam and electric automobiles that will be just as economical as the old cars.
In the meantime, streetcars are gradually replacing buses all over the country because of the greater economy of electric power. And many people who have seldom used public transportation are now riding the streetcars while their automobiles rust in their garages. There's no market at all for their big, luxurious cars, for only the wealthy can now afford to operate them. Many people are now shopping in their own neighborhood, and small businesses are thriving.
Ministers, educators, and editorial writers are pointing out that there has been a great improvement in family life. Families now stay at home more for their fun, and children and parents are becoming better acquainted. The stores report a booming business in parlor games, hobby materials, books, musical instruments and albums.
People have lost their pale indoor look. The revival of the lost art of walking has brought a healthy pink back to many a cheek. This return to the heels has revolutionized the clothing styles; people now need to be ready for all kinds of weather:
These conditions, however, may not last. Already our clever chemists are at work on new synthetic fuels which, they say, will put us right back where we wereon wheels. Shall we wish them success or not? 
 Question:The following sentences are the results of the gas price rising EXCEPT  _  . 
A. More people prefer to travel on public transportation which costs less than driving cars. 
B. People return to the traditional exercise of walking, which helps them to look healthier. 
C. People shop in nearby stores without having to drive, so small businesses are increasing. 
D. The auto industry has been forced to develop new models which are more expensive. 
 Answer: D

Context: Liz Parle can't drive. ""I did try to learn,"" says the 24-year-old, Birmingham-born cafe owner, ""but I failed my test a few times."" Then she moved to London, where running a car can be a nightmare. Instead she cycles everywhere. ""It's cheap, keeps me fit, and is of course better for the environment.""
   _ In Britain, the percentage of 17- to 20-year-olds with driving licences fell from 48% in the early 1990s to 35% last year. The number of miles travelled by all forms of domestic transport has remained unchanged for years. Meanwhile, road traffic figures for cars and taxis, having risen more or less every year since 1949, have continued to fall since 2007. Motoring groups put it down to oil prices and the economy. Others offer a more fundamental explanation: the golden age of motoring is over.
""The way we run cars is changing fast,"" says Tim Pollard, associate editor at CAR magazine, ""Car manufacturers are worried that younger people in particular don't like to own cars like we used to in the 70s, 80s, or even the 90s, they were owning things for shorter periods. As hi-tech research and development budgets try to keep pace with the iPhone generation, Pollard says carmakers are also coming to terms with less possessive buyers. 
This has led to a different ownership and rental  schemes such as Streetcar, Zipcar and Whipcar. In response, the latest deals from the big carmakers are very unlike your usual deals. ""Peugeot , for instance, has launched a European project called Mu,"" says Pollard. ""You become a member and can then rent whichever Peugeot best suits your mobility needs that day. So you can borrow a truck to move house at the weekend.' Other car manufacturers are studying similar ideas. 
 Question:Less younger people are having driving licences because   _  . 
A. they are not allowed by their parents 
B. they are concerned about the expense on the car 
C. they have no time to prepare for the driving test 
D. they are unwilling to obey the strict traffic rules

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair.

 Answer: C
Context: Eighth-grader Victoria Bills is talking about money with her classmates. She is worried that a company's stock   price could fall. It may be an unusual topic of conversation for a 13-year-old. But at Bills' school in Chicago, US, you hear it all the time.
The Chicago school's 420 students learn about economic . They also get a chance to make money. Each 1stgrade and 5thgrade, students learn the basics of economics and investing .
Then in 6thgrade, they put what they've learned to work. Students join a junior group that manages the $20,000. The group, made up of 12 to 14 students, decides which stocks to buy.
After graduating, students pass on $20,000 to the next 1stgrade class. They keep half of the rest of the money; the other half goes toward improving the school. They can choose to put their money in a college-savings program or take the cash.
In 2007, Bills suggested that her class buy the stock of the Apple computer company. This was just before the iPhone came out. ""We bought stock just at the right time,"" she says. The kids bought Google stock as it reached $400 a share. It is now worth over $500. ""It was a good buy,"" says Myles Gate, 13. He hopes to be a banker one day.
The school's two graduating classes of 2005 and 2006 have each earned about $10,000 in profits . 
 Question:Who manages the $20,000 in the class? 
A. The teachers. 
B. The school. 
C. The students. 
D. The parents. 
 Answer: C
Context: ""We don't necessarily believe that new advertising, which might make consumers feel better about the Coke brand or better about the ads themselves , will actually result in consumers consuming more of the product,"" Morgan Stanley's Bill Pecoriello wrote in a research note the days after the investor   meeting . But Coke is optimistic it can regain its old magic, and is banking on a new slogan: ""Welcome to the Coke side of life.""
BREAK THROUGH HIT? 
With PepsiCo about to surpass  Coke as the beverage king on Wall Street--Pepsi's market capitalization has  _ in recent years to $97.9 billion, putting it less than a billion dollars behind its rival--the heat is on Coke . It's set to launch a new marketing campaign in March, 2006. And having taken a quick look at Coke's investor presentation on Dec. 7 in New York, my sense is that Coke may be moving in the right direction .
Given the continued shift by consumers away from soda--Coke's stronghold --and into alternative beverages like juice, tea, and water, Coke badly needs a breakthrough hit. And given that shift away from soda, some analyists wonder whether even the catchiest new ads will be enough to put the fizz back into Coke.
SAME OLD, UPDATED?
    The new flavors of PowerAde sports drink will probably enable Coke to continue stealing market share from PepsiCo's Gatorade brand. And Coke is getting a little more creative with packaging, including new, aluminum bottles of Coke that will be sold in nightclubs, and an 8.4-ounce ""100 calorie"" version of its flagship Coke that will appeal to women who want fewer calories and will like the fact that the small can will fit in their purse. I doubt whether other new products will be successful, including a new coffee-flavored soda called Coke-Cola Black that I tried. Think carbonated coffee. But I'm not sure if the product, which Coke is pitching as an afternoon pick-me-up for the 35-and-over set, is going to pull people away from their afternoon Frappucino fix. And my opinion is that Vault, an orange-flavored energy drink, will have just as much trouble unseating Mountain Dew among teens as did Coke's last attempt, a product called Surge.
If there is one concern I have about the fresh offerings Coke plans to launch this year, it appears that many of them are simply new brands, not new products. 
 Question:According to the passage, we can know that   _  . 
A. Coke mainly depends on new products recently 
B. Nowadays Coke is comparatively less popular 
C. PepsiCo has taken the place of Coke 
D. Coke has few new brands

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----. 
A. planted less corn

Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption

Context: Alex Taw,a 21yearold student from Wiltshire,England.He spent last summer like any other high school graduate--hanging out with friends,preparing for college,worrying about his university fees.While most of his peers gave up on their pipe dreams,he sat down with a notebook at home,and jotted down   the question:How can I become a millionaire?
The result was the MillionDollarHomepage.com.Alex's initial investment was 50 pounds to buy web space and a domain   name.He divided the blank homepage into one million pixels  ,10,000 blocks of 100 pixels each.Each pixel was worth $1 with minimum purchase 100 pixels.Within a month Alex had earned some $37,000,enough for him to cover the entire cost of his forthcoming three years at university.In just a few months,he became a real millionaire.
How did he come up with the idea of the Million Dollar Homepage?
""Well,I was trying to think of a way to make some money before I started university,as I was about to take on a huge debt and I was already overdrawn  .Swift action was necessary!""He said.
He also added,""The important thing is that anything is possible--we are only limited by our imagination.I always had this belief that a good idea can be successful on its own.I think I've learnt that if we think deeper there are magical solutions hiding away for us to find.""
His personal philosophy around money is:Money is not everything,but it's an essential part of the way we live. _ 
He also said,""I still want to go to university.Aside from gaining knowledge about business,there are other reasons--exploring your interests,meeting new people,and being in a creative environment.""
Besides making contributions to society,he would try to encourage and inspire people to think of creative solutions to problems,whatever they are.

Context: Today, I will tell you a story about AbdulRahman, a friend of mine, who was the victim of the big name DHL. I am sure that 90% of you have at least heard of it. It is known for being the best company when it comes to shipping. It is thought to be fast ,reliable and safe. 
AbdulRahman's brother bought him a mobile phone while he was in the United Kingdom. He wanted to send it to him here in Kuwait .  AbdulRahman specifically asked him to send it through DHL. He trusted the company that much, as most people do.
But in the end, even though the company told him that it would take up to 5 days for the phone to arrive at AbdulRahman's door, he never received it. And after two weeks of him calling them and hearing the same response ""We will investigate the matter, and let you know of our decision by next week. We might pay you back up to 50% of the item's cost.""
So they are not paying him the full price of the thing they have lost, or as we think, they have stolen. We have reason to think that way, because according to the records, the mobile phone went ""missing"" while it was in a ""sorting facility"" of the company.
Last Tuesday, they stopped telling him ""We are investigating the matter"" and officially said, ""We ended the investigation. Your shipment is missing."" We are still waiting to hear their ""decision"" about whether they will try to make it up to him, by ""maybe"" paying him up to 50% , and nothing more. 
 Question:What does the writer think of DHL's response to the case? 
A. It is quick and in time. 
B. It is not bad. 
C. It is disappointing 
D. It is late but satisfying

Context: TOKYO-- At first glance, Japanese cellphones are young people's favorites, with elegant design and quick access to the Internet. However, despite years of competition in overseas markets, Japan's cellphone makers have little presence beyond the country's shores.
The only Japanese cellphone maker with any meaningful global share is Sony Ericsson, and that company is a London-based joint venture between a Japanese electronics maker and a Swedish telecommunications firm.
And Sony Ericsson has been hit by big losses. Its market share was just 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009, behind Nokia of Finland, Samsung Electronics and LG of South Korea, and Motorola of Illinois.
This year, Mr Natsuno, who developed a popular wireless Internet service called i-Mode, invited some of the best minds in the field to debate how Japanese cellphones could go global.
""The most amazing thing about Japan is that even the average person out there will have a very advanced phone, ""said Mr Natsuno. Japan has 100 million users of advanced third-generation smart phones, twice the number of the United States, a much larger market. Many Japanese rely on their phones, not a PC, for Internet access.
Indeed, Japanese cellphone makers thought they had positioned themselves to dominate the age of digital data. But they were a little too clever. In the 1990s, they set a standard for the second-generation network that was refused everywhere else. Then Japan quickly adopted a third-generation standard in 2001. However, it made Japanese phones too advanced for most markets.
Several Japanese companies are now considering a push into overseas markets, including NEC. Panasonic, Sharp, Toshiba and Fujitsu are said to be planning similar moves.
""Japanese cellphone makers need to either look overseas, or exit the business"", said Kenshi Tazaki, a managing vice president at the consulting firm Gartner Japan. 
 Question:Which of the following would be the best title for the passage? 
A. Japanese cellphone companies are unsuccessful. 
B. Japan has more cellphone users than the US. 
C. Japanese cellphone industry intends to expand overseas markets. 
D. Going global--a difficult task for Japanese companies.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer

Context: More and more Americans are showing an interest in healthy and locally-produced food. As the interest increases, raising chickens has been gaining popularity in some American cities.
""Look, we get three eggs this time.""
Collecting eggs is a daily pleasure for the Hurst family. Naomi Hurst says her family started to raise chickens in back of their home in Maryland a month ago.
""We have wanted to try having backyard chickens for a couple years now. And really just didn't have the time to build my own coop(;) and look out where to buy chickens. And then we met Rent a Coop,"" said Naomi Hurst.
Rent a Coop is a chicken rental business. Tyler Phillips launched the company with a partner 18 months ago. It comes with a mobile coop on wheels, two egg-laying hens, feed, bedding, water bowl, feed bowl, and our 24-hour chicken hotline. You can call with any questions. The price is 185 dollars for four weeks.
After the four weeks passed, individuals can extend the rental agreement, return everything or purchase the animals and supplies.
Tyler Phillips designs and makes the coops. He says he wants to do as little damage as possible to the environment.
""We always try to have as many recycled materials as possible. And I want the coops to be safe for kids. I want the chickens to be comfortable and they have access to the grass while being inside the coop. I want it to be easily movable, light weight,"" he said.
Some cities require people have large pieces of land, if they want to raise farm animals. Others require an agreement with neighbors, limit the number of chickens, or, even ban the birds.
Tyler Phillips expects that would change as interest in small poultry   coops grows.
""I see cities around the D. C. area changing laws almost monthly and different cities will change the law to being prochicken . That is happening all around the United States,"" he said, He believes that there will be chicken rental businesses in most American cities within five years.

Context: India is traditionally a tea-drinking country. But, it is now gaining a new taste for coffee. This has led international coffee companies to consider opening businesses in the huge market. Local business people are also hoping to profit from the country's tea-drinking habits. They want to open new stores that offer tea.
It is ten thirty in the morning in India. Two cafes are within meters of each other, near a college in New Delhi. And they are selling a lot of tea. Their main customers are undergraduate students.
""We have a lot of break between classes, so whenever we get time, we just go and we enjoy ourselves. It's a lot of fun , especially when you are with people you enjoy spending time with.""

Context: As a result of British colonial                rule, English language is the second most widely spoken language in India after the Hindi. Though it appears to be a second language, there is no question about its immense growth over the years in Indian history. It is the main language accepted and spoken in the fields of business and education across all places in India. India is ranked the third largest English-speaking population in the world besides the US and the UK.
English writing has blossomed   in India and has reached a peak where Indian writers like Arundhati Roy, Vikram Seth and Salman Rushdie were able to distinguish themselves in the whole world. Many Indian authors bring out books on Indian culture and literature. Shobha De, a famous fashion and lifestyle columnist   is one of the important writers to be mentioned who have paved the way for others to follow suit.
Quite a few newspapers like The Hindu, Times of India and Indian Express have increased the popularity and acceptance of English in India greatly. They have played an important role in spreading English in all comers of the country.
One of the major contributors in promoting English language development in India is the education system. Private schools and colleges play a major role in preparing students with spoken and written skills in English. The standard is so high that we can see young students actively taking part in group discussions and quiz competitions to show their talents all over the world. 
Indian movies don't lag behind  . There are so many English movies that come out of India every year. The world's movie capital is not Hollywood but Bollywood, which is the nickname              for the Indian film industry located in Mumbai. Movies like Bend It Like Beckham and Monsoon Wedding have great international influence. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE according to the text? 
A. Most of Indians speak English rather than Hindi. 
B. India has the largest English-speaking population in the world. 
C. Indian movie industry lags far behind compared with other fields. 
D. The education system helps to develop English language. 
 Answer: D
Context: For most of the 20th century, Asia asked itself what it could learn from the modern, innovating West. Now the question must be reversed. What can the West's overly indebted and sluggish   nations learn from a flourishing Asia?
Just a few decades ago, Asia's two giants were stagnating  under faulty economic ideologies. However, once China began embracing free-market reforms in the 1980s, followed by India in the 1990s, both countries achieved rapid growth. Crucially, as they opened up their markets, they balanced market economy with sensible government direction. As the Indian economist Amartya Sen has wisely said, ""The invisible hand of the market has often relied heavily on the visible hand of government.""
Contrast this middle path with America and Europe, which have each gone ideologically over-board in their own ways. Since the 1980s, America has been increasingly clinging to the ideology of uncontrolled free markets and dismissing the role of government---following Ronald Regan's idea that ""government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem. ""Of course, when the markets came crashing down in 2007, it was decisive government intervention that saved the day. Despite this fact, many Americans are still strongly opposed to ""big government.""
If Americans could only free themselves from their antigovernment doctrine(,), they would begin to see that the America's problems are not insoluble. A few sensible federal measures could put the country back on the right path. A simple consumption tax of, say, 5% would significantly reduce the country's huge government deficit  without damaging productivity. A small gasoline tax would help free America from its dependence on oil imports and create motivations for green energy development. In the same way, a significant reduction of wasteful agricultural subsidies could also lower the deficit. But in order to take advantage of these common-sense solutions, Americans will have to put aside their own attachment to the idea of smaller government and less regulation. American politicians will have to develop the courage to follow what is taught in all American public-policy schools: that there are good taxes and bad taxes. Asian countries have embraced this wisdom, and have built sound long-term fiscal   policies as a result.
Meanwhile, Europe has fallen prey  to a different ideological trap: the belief that European governments would always have infinite resources and could continue borrowing as if there were no tomorrow. Unlike the Americans, who felt that the markets knew best, the Europeans failed to expect how the markets would react to their endless borrowing. Today, the European Union is creating a $580 billion fund to prevent sovereign collapse. This will buy the EU time, but it will not solve the bloc's larger problem. 
 Question:What's the problem with the European Union? 
A. Lack of resources 
B. Excessive borrowing. 
C. Conservative ideology. 
D. Shrinking market.

Context: Since I started working part-time at a grocery store, I have learned that a customer is more than someone who buys things. To me, a customer is a person whose memory fails entirely once he or she starts to push a shopping cart. One of the first things customers forget is how to count. There is no other way to explain how so many people get in their express line, which is clearly marked 15 items  or less, with 20, 25 or even a cart load of items.
Customers also forget why they came to the store in the first place. Just as I finish ringing up an order, a customer will say, ""Oops, I forgot to pick up a fresh loaf of bread. I hope you don't mind waiting, while I go to get it.""Five minutes later, he's back with the bread, a bottle of milk, and three rolls of paper towels. What is strange is that customers also seem to forget that they have to pay for their groceries. Instead of writing a check or looking for a credit card while I am ringing up the groceries, a customer will wait until I announce the total. Then, in surprise, she says, "" Oh no, what did I do with my check book?"" After 5 minutes of digging through her purse, she borrows my pen because she has forgotten hers. But I have to tolerate customers because they pay my salary, and that's something I can't afford to forget. 
 Question:When customers arrive at the check-out counter, they  _ 
A. find their pens lost 
B. go back and get more items 
C. cannot wait to pay for their groceries. 
D. prefer paying by check to paying with a credit card.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B
Context: China and Japan are respectively the world's secondandthirdlargest economies. In 2008, China-Japan trade grew to $266.4 billion, a rise of 12.5 percent on 2007, making China and Japan the top two-way trading partners. China was also the biggest destination for Japanese exports in 2009.
The relationship between China and Japan has been  _ at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge itswartimepast to the satisfaction of China. China joined other Asian countries, such asSouth Korea,North KoreaandSingapore, in criticizing Japanese history textbooks that whitenJapanese war crimesinWorld War II. They claimed that the rise ofmilitarismbecame evident in Japanese politics. Muchanti-Japanese emotion has risen, because of the increasing feelings ofChinese nationalismand former Prime MinisterJunichiro Koizumi's visits to theYasukuni Shrine . Although Koizumi openly declared---in a statement made on April 22, 2005 in Jakarta--- ""deep regret"" overJapan's wartime crimes, many Chinese observers regard the apology as insufficient and not consistent with the action.
Sino-Japan relations changed slightly after Shinzo Abebecame thePrime Minister of Japanin September 2006, and a joint historical study conducted by China and Japan released a report in 2010 which pointed toward new agreement on the issue ofWorld War II-era violent action.
However, there also remains the dispute  over the Diaoyu Islands, which resulted in clashes between Taiwanese (Chinese) protesters and the Japanese government in April 2005. The incident led to anti-Japanese protests and violence across Mainland China, from BeijingtoShanghai, laterGuangzhou,ShenzhenandShenyang. In August 2012, Hong Kong activists landed on one of the disputed Diaoyu Islands, and Japanese nationalists responded by landing on the island the following week. The incidents set off the largest-scale anti-Japanese protests in China for decades in which protesters vandalized Japanese shops and cars. On the 14th of September relations worsened even further in response to Japan's announcement of plans to buy the island from its private owners. The news resulted in the Chinese government sending six surveillance  ships to the islands and further anti-Japanese protests in which protesters attacked the Japanese embassies in Shanghai and Beijing. 
 Question:Which of the following can improve the Sino-Japan relations? 
A. Strengthening their economic tie. 
B. Reaching an agreement on their disputes. 
C. Stopping vandalizing Japanese shops and cars. 
D. Shinzo Abe becoming Japanese prime minister.

Context: When Denis Hennequin took over as the European boss of McDonald's in January 2004, the world's biggest restaurant chain was showing signs of recovery in America and Australia, but sales in Europe were sluggish or declining.One exception was France, where Mr.Hennequin had done a reliable job as head on the group's French subsidiary  to sell more Big Macs to his relatives, His task was to copy this success in all 41 of the European countries where anti-globalisers' favourite enemy operates.
So far Mr.Henncquin is doing well.Last year European sales increased by 5.8% and the number of customers by 3.4%, the best annual results in nearly 15 years.Europe accounted for 36% of the group's profits and for 28 of its sales.December was an especially good month as customers took to seasonal menu offerings in France and Britain, and to a promotion in Germany based on the game of Monopoly .
Mr.Hennequin's recipe for revival  is to be more open about his company's operations, to be ""locally relevant"", and to improve the experience of visiting his 6.400 restaurants. McDonaId's is blamed for making people fat, exploiting workers, treating animals cruelly, polluting the environment and simply for being American.Mr.Hennequin says he wants to engage in a dialogue with the public to address these concerns.
He introduced ""open door"" visitor days in each country which became hugely popular.In Poland alone some 50,000 visitors came to McDonaId's through the visitors' program last year.The Nutrition Information Initiative launched last year, put detailed Sables on McDonaId's packaging with data on calories, protein, fat, carbohy drates and salt content, ""the details are also printed on tray-liners. 
 Question:What did Denis Hennequin do to increase the sales of McDonald in Europe? 
A. He visited all the McDonaId's branches in Europe. 
B. He introduced ""open door"" visitor's days in each country. 
C. He had done a reliable job as head of the group's French subsidiary.

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government.

Context: The dollar is becoming weaker and weaker. What effects will it have?
Look at the recordhigh price of oil. Even if the same amount of oil is being pumped out of the ground,since it is traded in dollars and the dollar has weakened,the price of oil has increased to make up for the lost value of the dollar,creating a sort of vicious cycle .
Oilproducing countries don't want to keep all the dollars they are getting for their oil,since it's declining in value,so they exchange their dollars for euros or other currencies. That pushes more dollars back out into currency markets,which in turn pushes down the dollar's value.
One expert told ABC News that Russia used to have 90 percent of its financial reserves in dollars. It now has 45 percent in dollars,45 percent in euros and 10 percent in British pounds.
In the US itself,the news is mixed. It's good,because it makes what we produce here cheaper to sell in foreign markets,and that in turn spurs  exports of our products around the world. That translates into more manufacturing and more jobs.
But a weak dollar is bad,because it leads to inflation   in this country. Imports from foreign countries will become more expensive,and in particular,oil will be more expensive. That puts pressure on businesses to increase prices for anything that uses oil or products that come from overseas. One benefit for American shoppers is that China has largely pegged its currency to ours,so that keeps the price of Chinesemade goods low and therefore,keeps a check on inflation. 
 Question:Which of the following would be the best title for this passage? 
A. Why is the dollar losing value? 
B. What caused the weak dollar? 
C. What to do with the weak dollar? 
D. What effects will the weak dollar have?

Context: prefix = st1 /China's economic growth 'hard to predict'
The worsening global economic situation makes it difficult for Chinato predict its growth for next year, a senior official said on Friday.
""How fast China's economy will grow next year is uncertain,"" Liu He, deputy director of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Finance and Economy Work, told China Daily.
""To a large  _ , the rate will be decided by the external situation,"" Liu said during a discussion with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and other economists in Beijing.
This year, GDP is estimated to grow at 9.4 or 9.5 percent, down from 10.6 percent last year, he said. However, the impact of the current financial turbulence ""on our economy is much less than on the rest of the world"", he said.
Nicholas Stern, a former UK government advisor, also told China Daily it will take at least one or two years for the world to recover from the recession, which is now spreading from the US and the UK to the rest of the world.
""We don't know how long the recession will last, but it is unlikely to be short,"" he said.
Liu said China can use the downturn as an opportunity to restructure its economy, which has relied heavily on government investment, foreign trade and low-cost technology over the past years.
""When the economy is experiencing fast growth, companies are unwilling to upgrade their technologies,"" Liu said.
""The slowdown gives such firms the opportunity to enhance their competitive edge through better technologies.""

Context: A U.S. dad quit his job, giving up a massive salary, after his 10-year-old daughter gave him a 22-point list outlining all the events he missed so far during the year. As the CEO of the $2 trillion global investment fund PIMCO, Mohamed El-Erian shocked the finance industry when he quit in January.
El-Erian said it was about a year ago when he was repeatedly asking his daughter to brush her teeth, but she wasn't listening. When he asked her why, she responded with a list of 22 milestones he had missed: like the first day of school and the first soccer game of the season.
""And the school year wasn't yet over,"" El-Erian wrote. ""I felt awful and got defensive: I had a good excuse for each missed event! Travel, important meetings, and urgent phone call, sudden to-dos. But it dawned on me that I was missing an infinitely more important point. My work-life balance had gotten out of whack, and the imbalance was hurting my very special relationship with my daughter. I was not making enough time for her."" El-Erian explained he was struggling with the same thing so many parents do--work-life balance.
Dads who are quitting their profit-making jobs to improve work-life balance is a subject that is getting more traction as some high-profile executive have recently written about their experiences.
Last month, former MongoDB CEO Max Schireson wrote a blog post for Time about his decision to step down from the company's top job. He wrote that he struggled to make time for his three children because he was flying around half a million kilometres a year for work.
""I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car, or when my son had an emergency surgery,"" Schireson wrote.
On an overnight flight to Texas he woke up in Arizona to discover the plane made an emergency landing and some traumatized crew members had to be replaced. He decided it was time to address his work-life balance.
Quitting is something El-Erian and Schireson were financially able to do, but El-Erian recognizes most people don't have this luxury. He hopes companies will pay attention to improving work-life balance for their employees.
El-Erian now manages ""a portfolio of part-time jobs"" that don't require as much travel. He alternates mornings with his wife taking their daughter to school and he often picks her up from school.
""So far, it's been the right decision for me,"" he wrote. ""I'm so grateful that this is providing me greater opportunity to experience key moments in my daughter's life before they're all too quickly gone."" 
 Question:El-Erian resigned from PIMCO mainly because   _  . 
A. his daughter has been missing him badly 
B. he was getting bored with the endless flights 
C. he hoped to get his daughter to listen to her 
D. he wanted to experience his daughter's milestones

Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption 
 Answer: D
Context: In recent years, the price of gas has been rising sharply, and people have made many adjustments.
There was, for a time, considerable unemployment in the auto industry, and three quarters of the garages and service stations have gone out of business. However; the bicycle and motor-scooter business has flourished ; and many people have found employment there: Now that Federal Motors has brought out its new Lilliput, which travels forty miles on a gallon, the auto business is picking up again. The factories that haven't switched over to two-wheel transportation are working on their new smaller models. There is talk, too, about bringing out new steam and electric automobiles that will be just as economical as the old cars.
In the meantime, streetcars are gradually replacing buses all over the country because of the greater economy of electric power. And many people who have seldom used public transportation are now riding the streetcars while their automobiles rust in their garages. There's no market at all for their big, luxurious cars, for only the wealthy can now afford to operate them. Many people are now shopping in their own neighborhood, and small businesses are thriving.
Ministers, educators, and editorial writers are pointing out that there has been a great improvement in family life. Families now stay at home more for their fun, and children and parents are becoming better acquainted. The stores report a booming business in parlor games, hobby materials, books, musical instruments and albums.
People have lost their pale indoor look. The revival of the lost art of walking has brought a healthy pink back to many a cheek. This return to the heels has revolutionized the clothing styles; people now need to be ready for all kinds of weather:
These conditions, however, may not last. Already our clever chemists are at work on new synthetic fuels which, they say, will put us right back where we wereon wheels. Shall we wish them success or not? 
 Question:The following sentences are the results of the gas price rising EXCEPT  _  . 
A. More people prefer to travel on public transportation which costs less than driving cars. 
B. People return to the traditional exercise of walking, which helps them to look healthier. 
C. People shop in nearby stores without having to drive, so small businesses are increasing. 
D. The auto industry has been forced to develop new models which are more expensive.

Context: My summer hols wr CWOT. B4, we usd 2 go 2 NY 2C my bro, his CF & thr 3:-@ kids FTF ILNY, its gr8.
Can you understand this sentence? If you can't, don't feel too bad: neither could the middle school teacher in England who received this as homework. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cellphones. To newcomers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the ""translation"" of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York; it's great.
Schoolteachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes cxan be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted .
Everyone should just relax, say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nunberg, from Stanford University, agrees. ""People get better at writing by writing,"" he says, ""Kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mail, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than, their parents.""
Linguist James Millroy says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can bet your bottom dollar that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents, they too will think this way. Milroy argues that languages do not and cannot become ""corrupted""; they simply change to meet the new needs.
However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write Standard English. Cynthia McVey says, ""I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but that learning to write proper English is a must for their future.""
Perhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway. Erin, age 12, says, ""I wouldn't use text language in my homework. Texting is just for fun"" 
 Question:Which of the following is true according to the passage? 
A. Cynthia McVey points out teenagers can deal with Netspeak properly. 
B. Geoffrey Nunberg believes Netspeakers can write Standard English. 
C. David Crystal thinks Netspeak helps develop the habit of writing. 
D. James Milroy says that language is changing and improving.

Context: 2009 is the year of what? Yes, it's the year of the Ox. But do you know that 2009 is also the year of the telescope? This year the world celebrates the 400thanniversary of Galileo's observations of the universe through an astronomical telescope  . In 1609, the Italian scientist first pointed a ""Dutch perspective glass"" at the night sky and made discoveries that changed mankind's conceptions of the universe. 
In honor of Galileo's discoveries, the United Nations and the International Astronomical Union have declared 2009 to be the International Year of Astronomy (IYA 2009).
IYA 2009 is a yearlong celebration of astronomy. Its goal is to spread knowledge of astronomy's contributions to society and culture and to inspire more interest in astronomy and science, especially among young people. The theme of the celebration is ""The Universe, Yours to Discover.""
One interesting aim of the IYA is to encourage more diversity   in the field of astronomy and physics. IYA organizers hope that the yearlong celebration of astronomy will inspire more females and underrepresented minorities to pursue   careers in science. An event that will help further that goal is 100 Hours of Astronomy (100 HA) that will fall on April. This event aims to have as many people as possible look through a telescope. From April 2ndto 5th, millions of people worldwide will peer through telescopes to catch their first glimpse   of the universe, just as Galileo's did 400 years ago. Sidewalk astronomy events will give city-dwellers   an excellent opportunity to see the moon, the planet Saturn, and other objects in position for early evening observations. 
Organizers hope that the activities of IYA will ""promote   a greater appreciation of the astronomy."" So join the fun. Look through a telescope this year!

Context: China and Japan are respectively the world's secondandthirdlargest economies. In 2008, China-Japan trade grew to $266.4 billion, a rise of 12.5 percent on 2007, making China and Japan the top two-way trading partners. China was also the biggest destination for Japanese exports in 2009.
The relationship between China and Japan has been  _ at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge itswartimepast to the satisfaction of China. China joined other Asian countries, such asSouth Korea,North KoreaandSingapore, in criticizing Japanese history textbooks that whitenJapanese war crimesinWorld War II. They claimed that the rise ofmilitarismbecame evident in Japanese politics. Muchanti-Japanese emotion has risen, because of the increasing feelings ofChinese nationalismand former Prime MinisterJunichiro Koizumi's visits to theYasukuni Shrine . Although Koizumi openly declared---in a statement made on April 22, 2005 in Jakarta--- ""deep regret"" overJapan's wartime crimes, many Chinese observers regard the apology as insufficient and not consistent with the action.
Sino-Japan relations changed slightly after Shinzo Abebecame thePrime Minister of Japanin September 2006, and a joint historical study conducted by China and Japan released a report in 2010 which pointed toward new agreement on the issue ofWorld War II-era violent action.
However, there also remains the dispute  over the Diaoyu Islands, which resulted in clashes between Taiwanese (Chinese) protesters and the Japanese government in April 2005. The incident led to anti-Japanese protests and violence across Mainland China, from BeijingtoShanghai, laterGuangzhou,ShenzhenandShenyang. In August 2012, Hong Kong activists landed on one of the disputed Diaoyu Islands, and Japanese nationalists responded by landing on the island the following week. The incidents set off the largest-scale anti-Japanese protests in China for decades in which protesters vandalized Japanese shops and cars. On the 14th of September relations worsened even further in response to Japan's announcement of plans to buy the island from its private owners. The news resulted in the Chinese government sending six surveillance  ships to the islands and further anti-Japanese protests in which protesters attacked the Japanese embassies in Shanghai and Beijing. 
 Question:Which of the following can improve the Sino-Japan relations? 
A. Strengthening their economic tie. 
B. Reaching an agreement on their disputes. 
C. Stopping vandalizing Japanese shops and cars. 
D. Shinzo Abe becoming Japanese prime minister.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.

Context: Joker found one of the biggest diamonds in the world right in his own back yard. He sold the stone to a diamond dealer for over three hundred thousand dollars. In New York, the diamond was resold---this time for almost eight hundred thousand dollars. The true value of a diamond is never known until it has been cut. Once cut successfully, its value can increase a thousand times. It's easy to understand why the owner of Joker's diamond went to the best diamond cutter he knew, Kaplan.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.

Context: Eighth-grader Victoria Bills is talking about money with her classmates. She is worried that a company's stock   price could fall. It may be an unusual topic of conversation for a 13-year-old. But at Bills' school in Chicago, US, you hear it all the time.
The Chicago school's 420 students learn about economic . They also get a chance to make money. Each 1stgrade and 5thgrade, students learn the basics of economics and investing .
Then in 6thgrade, they put what they've learned to work. Students join a junior group that manages the $20,000. The group, made up of 12 to 14 students, decides which stocks to buy.
After graduating, students pass on $20,000 to the next 1stgrade class. They keep half of the rest of the money; the other half goes toward improving the school. They can choose to put their money in a college-savings program or take the cash.
In 2007, Bills suggested that her class buy the stock of the Apple computer company. This was just before the iPhone came out. ""We bought stock just at the right time,"" she says. The kids bought Google stock as it reached $400 a share. It is now worth over $500. ""It was a good buy,"" says Myles Gate, 13. He hopes to be a banker one day.
The school's two graduating classes of 2005 and 2006 have each earned about $10,000 in profits . 
 Question:Who manages the $20,000 in the class? 
A. The teachers. 
B. The school. 
C. The students. 
D. The parents. 
 Answer: C
Context: A U.S. dad quit his job, giving up a massive salary, after his 10-year-old daughter gave him a 22-point list outlining all the events he missed so far during the year. As the CEO of the $2 trillion global investment fund PIMCO, Mohamed El-Erian shocked the finance industry when he quit in January.
El-Erian said it was about a year ago when he was repeatedly asking his daughter to brush her teeth, but she wasn't listening. When he asked her why, she responded with a list of 22 milestones he had missed: like the first day of school and the first soccer game of the season.
""And the school year wasn't yet over,"" El-Erian wrote. ""I felt awful and got defensive: I had a good excuse for each missed event! Travel, important meetings, and urgent phone call, sudden to-dos. But it dawned on me that I was missing an infinitely more important point. My work-life balance had gotten out of whack, and the imbalance was hurting my very special relationship with my daughter. I was not making enough time for her."" El-Erian explained he was struggling with the same thing so many parents do--work-life balance.
Dads who are quitting their profit-making jobs to improve work-life balance is a subject that is getting more traction as some high-profile executive have recently written about their experiences.
Last month, former MongoDB CEO Max Schireson wrote a blog post for Time about his decision to step down from the company's top job. He wrote that he struggled to make time for his three children because he was flying around half a million kilometres a year for work.
""I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car, or when my son had an emergency surgery,"" Schireson wrote.
On an overnight flight to Texas he woke up in Arizona to discover the plane made an emergency landing and some traumatized crew members had to be replaced. He decided it was time to address his work-life balance.
Quitting is something El-Erian and Schireson were financially able to do, but El-Erian recognizes most people don't have this luxury. He hopes companies will pay attention to improving work-life balance for their employees.
El-Erian now manages ""a portfolio of part-time jobs"" that don't require as much travel. He alternates mornings with his wife taking their daughter to school and he often picks her up from school.
""So far, it's been the right decision for me,"" he wrote. ""I'm so grateful that this is providing me greater opportunity to experience key moments in my daughter's life before they're all too quickly gone."" 
 Question:El-Erian resigned from PIMCO mainly because   _  . 
A. his daughter has been missing him badly 
B. he was getting bored with the endless flights 
C. he hoped to get his daughter to listen to her 
D. he wanted to experience his daughter's milestones

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT.""

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT.""

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption

Context: Decreasing grain prices along with growing costs of production means Chinese farmers are unlikely to see a significant rise in income next year. [:ZXXK]
China's economic planning chief Ma Kai expressed the concern as the government undertakes an ambitious program to improve rural people's lives.
Grain prices have been dropping since April; and prices of wheat, corn and rice fell 5 per cent from August to October compared with the same period last year, Ma, minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, told an annual meeting on development and reform held over the weekend.
Meanwhile, prices of production materials rose 9.1 per cent year on year during the first 10 months.
The situation makes it difficult to achieve a ""new socialist countryside,"" which was last week highlighted as a new concept and ""common action"" of the whole Party and nation.
Vice-Minister of Agriculture Yin Chengjie also said China's entry to the World Trade Organization also creates _ for income rises for the country's 780 million farmers.
Farmers' income is expected to increase by 5 per cent this year, hitting the target set by the central government at the beginning of this year.
Last year, per capita net income of Chinese farmers reached 2,936 yuan (US$362), up 6.8 per cent year on year, and the highest increase since 1997.
Ma also said China would continue to seek fast, steady economic growth in 2012 but more efforts will be made to deal with the challenges brought about by overheating in some industrial sectors  .
(from China Daily, December 5, 2011) 
 Question:From1997 to 2011, the highest increase in farmers' income was achieved in   _  . 
A. 2009 
B. 2010 
C. 2011 
D. 2008 
 Answer: B
Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government.

Context: A U.S. dad quit his job, giving up a massive salary, after his 10-year-old daughter gave him a 22-point list outlining all the events he missed so far during the year. As the CEO of the $2 trillion global investment fund PIMCO, Mohamed El-Erian shocked the finance industry when he quit in January.
El-Erian said it was about a year ago when he was repeatedly asking his daughter to brush her teeth, but she wasn't listening. When he asked her why, she responded with a list of 22 milestones he had missed: like the first day of school and the first soccer game of the season.
""And the school year wasn't yet over,"" El-Erian wrote. ""I felt awful and got defensive: I had a good excuse for each missed event! Travel, important meetings, and urgent phone call, sudden to-dos. But it dawned on me that I was missing an infinitely more important point. My work-life balance had gotten out of whack, and the imbalance was hurting my very special relationship with my daughter. I was not making enough time for her."" El-Erian explained he was struggling with the same thing so many parents do--work-life balance.
Dads who are quitting their profit-making jobs to improve work-life balance is a subject that is getting more traction as some high-profile executive have recently written about their experiences.
Last month, former MongoDB CEO Max Schireson wrote a blog post for Time about his decision to step down from the company's top job. He wrote that he struggled to make time for his three children because he was flying around half a million kilometres a year for work.
""I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car, or when my son had an emergency surgery,"" Schireson wrote.
On an overnight flight to Texas he woke up in Arizona to discover the plane made an emergency landing and some traumatized crew members had to be replaced. He decided it was time to address his work-life balance.
Quitting is something El-Erian and Schireson were financially able to do, but El-Erian recognizes most people don't have this luxury. He hopes companies will pay attention to improving work-life balance for their employees.
El-Erian now manages ""a portfolio of part-time jobs"" that don't require as much travel. He alternates mornings with his wife taking their daughter to school and he often picks her up from school.
""So far, it's been the right decision for me,"" he wrote. ""I'm so grateful that this is providing me greater opportunity to experience key moments in my daughter's life before they're all too quickly gone."" 
 Question:El-Erian resigned from PIMCO mainly because   _  . 
A. his daughter has been missing him badly 
B. he was getting bored with the endless flights 
C. he hoped to get his daughter to listen to her 
D. he wanted to experience his daughter's milestones

Context: prefix = st1 /China's economic growth 'hard to predict'
The worsening global economic situation makes it difficult for Chinato predict its growth for next year, a senior official said on Friday.
""How fast China's economy will grow next year is uncertain,"" Liu He, deputy director of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Finance and Economy Work, told China Daily.
""To a large  _ , the rate will be decided by the external situation,"" Liu said during a discussion with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and other economists in Beijing.
This year, GDP is estimated to grow at 9.4 or 9.5 percent, down from 10.6 percent last year, he said. However, the impact of the current financial turbulence ""on our economy is much less than on the rest of the world"", he said.
Nicholas Stern, a former UK government advisor, also told China Daily it will take at least one or two years for the world to recover from the recession, which is now spreading from the US and the UK to the rest of the world.
""We don't know how long the recession will last, but it is unlikely to be short,"" he said.
Liu said China can use the downturn as an opportunity to restructure its economy, which has relied heavily on government investment, foreign trade and low-cost technology over the past years.
""When the economy is experiencing fast growth, companies are unwilling to upgrade their technologies,"" Liu said.
""The slowdown gives such firms the opportunity to enhance their competitive edge through better technologies.""

He came downstairs, where his mother and his two sisters were washing up tea things in the kitchen. ""These new trousers are too long."" He said. "" They need shortening  by about two inches. Would one of you mind doing this for me, please?"" His mother and sisters were busy and they said nothing.
But as soon as his mother had finished washing up, she went quietly upstairs to her son's bedroom and shortened the trousers by two inches. She came downstairs without saying anything to her daughters.
Later on, after supper, the elder sister remembered her brother's trousers. She was a kind-hearted girl, so she went quietly upstairs without saying anything to anyone and shortened the trousers by two inches.
The younger sister went to the cinema, but when she came back, she, too, remembered what her brother had said. So she ran upstairs and took two inches off the legs of the new trousers.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .

 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: When Denis Hennequin took over as the European boss of McDonald's in January 2004, the world's biggest restaurant chain was showing signs of recovery in America and Australia, but sales in Europe were sluggish or declining.One exception was France, where Mr.Hennequin had done a reliable job as head on the group's French subsidiary  to sell more Big Macs to his relatives, His task was to copy this success in all 41 of the European countries where anti-globalisers' favourite enemy operates.
So far Mr.Henncquin is doing well.Last year European sales increased by 5.8% and the number of customers by 3.4%, the best annual results in nearly 15 years.Europe accounted for 36% of the group's profits and for 28 of its sales.December was an especially good month as customers took to seasonal menu offerings in France and Britain, and to a promotion in Germany based on the game of Monopoly .
Mr.Hennequin's recipe for revival  is to be more open about his company's operations, to be ""locally relevant"", and to improve the experience of visiting his 6.400 restaurants. McDonaId's is blamed for making people fat, exploiting workers, treating animals cruelly, polluting the environment and simply for being American.Mr.Hennequin says he wants to engage in a dialogue with the public to address these concerns.
He introduced ""open door"" visitor days in each country which became hugely popular.In Poland alone some 50,000 visitors came to McDonaId's through the visitors' program last year.The Nutrition Information Initiative launched last year, put detailed Sables on McDonaId's packaging with data on calories, protein, fat, carbohy drates and salt content, ""the details are also printed on tray-liners. 
 Question:What did Denis Hennequin do to increase the sales of McDonald in Europe? 
A. He visited all the McDonaId's branches in Europe. 
B. He introduced ""open door"" visitor's days in each country. 
C. He had done a reliable job as head of the group's French subsidiary. 
D. He engaged in a dialogue with the public.

Context: The dollar is becoming weaker and weaker. What effects will it have?
Look at the recordhigh price of oil. Even if the same amount of oil is being pumped out of the ground,since it is traded in dollars and the dollar has weakened,the price of oil has increased to make up for the lost value of the dollar,creating a sort of vicious cycle .
Oilproducing countries don't want to keep all the dollars they are getting for their oil,since it's declining in value,so they exchange their dollars for euros or other currencies. That pushes more dollars back out into currency markets,which in turn pushes down the dollar's value.
One expert told ABC News that Russia used to have 90 percent of its financial reserves in dollars. It now has 45 percent in dollars,45 percent in euros and 10 percent in British pounds.
In the US itself,the news is mixed. It's good,because it makes what we produce here cheaper to sell in foreign markets,and that in turn spurs  exports of our products around the world. That translates into more manufacturing and more jobs.
But a weak dollar is bad,because it leads to inflation   in this country. Imports from foreign countries will become more expensive,and in particular,oil will be more expensive. That puts pressure on businesses to increase prices for anything that uses oil or products that come from overseas. One benefit for American shoppers is that China has largely pegged its currency to ours,so that keeps the price of Chinesemade goods low and therefore,keeps a check on inflation. 
 Question:It can be inferred that   _  . 
A. the American economy is having a hard time 
B. Russia is making the situation worse on purpose 
C. American export businesses would like a stronger dollar 
D. Chinesemade goods remain as competitive as before in the USA

Context: New rules will let millions of Americans know where more of their food comes from. The law is known as COOL -- Country of Origin Labeling .
American congress first passed the law in 2002. Stores have had to label seafood by country of origin since 2005. But industry pressure delayed other requirements until last week.
Products that must now be labeled include fresh fruits and vegetables, muscle meats and some kinds of nuts. But the rules are complex, and many foods are not included. For example, organ meats are free to be labeled. So are processed foods, including cooked or smoked foods.
The same food may sometimes have to be labeled and other times not. Fresh or frozen peas, for example, have to be labeled but not canned peas. Foods that are mixed with other foods are also excluded. Mixed nuts, for example, do not need to be labeled. The same is true of a salad mix that contains different things like lettuce and carrots. Or a fruit cup that combines different fruits. Also, the law doesn't include restaurants and other food service organizations. Department of Agriculture officials say the law is really meant for larger grocery stores.
The United States has imported more and more food in recent years to save money and expand choices. Country-of-origin labeling has become more common lately but has still been limited in many stores.
Food safety is one reason why some shoppers pay close attention to where foods came from. For example, when a large number of people recently got sick from salmonella , officials blamed peppers from Mexico. Yet the last big food scare involved spinach grown in California. But labeling is also a way for people to know they are getting what they want. Some want to buy local foods or foods from a particular country.
The country-of-origin labeling law gives stores 30 days to correct any violations  that are found. Stores and suppliers that are found to be deliberately violating the law could be fined 1,000 dollars per violation. Federal inspectors are not to take action to enforce the law for six months to give time for an education campaign.
Some food safety activists say they are generally pleased with the law. They call it a good step that will give people more useful information. 
 Question:The new rules of the country-of-origin labeling law will come into effect  _  . 
A. right now 
B. in a month 
C. in three months 
D. in half a year

The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.

Context: Tobacco companies are fighting efforts in the United States and Australia to make their products less appealing. In Washington, a federal judge last week blocked the Food and Drug Administration from requiring new warning labels on cigarette packs. Judge Richard Leon ruled in a case brought by five tobacco companies. The judge temporarily stopped a new federal rule which requires large new warnings starting next September. These include color1 images such as a dead body or diseased lungs. And simple text warnings now appear.
Congress called for color1 images showing the dangers of smoking, similar to what Canada does. But the tobacco companies say the new requirements approved in June violate   their free speech rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Judge Leon said the FDA could not require the new labels before a lawsuit  against the government is decided. Some experts say the process could take years. The judge said he believed the cigarette makers were highly likely to win their case.
He said the images should be designed to appeal to emotions, rejecting government arguments that they should be purely factual. He accused the government of trying to use the labels to promote an ""obvious anti-smoking agenda?""
The head of an anti-smoking group, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the decision ""wrong on the science and wrong on the law"".
About one-fifth of American adults smoke. The World Health Organization says tobacco kills nearly six mil-lion people worldwide each year. More than six hundred thousand of them are non-smokers who breathe other people's tobacco smoke.
In Australia, tobacco companies want to stop what would be the world's most restrictive laws on cigarette advertising. Cigarettes could be sold only in plain olive-green packages. Only the brand name and health warnings could appear. The Senate passed the bill last week and sent it back to the Lower House to approve minor amendments  . The law is to go into effect in December of next year.
Tobacco companies Say the legislation   violates the Australian constitution. They say it would unjustly reduce the value of their brand names and trademarks. Health Minister Nicola Roxon says the government is ready for a legal fight. 
 Question:What are the tobacco companies ii1 the United States and Australia fighting against? 
A. The requirements to sell fewer products to the public. 
B. The requirements to print new warning labels on their products. 
C. The measures to make their products more attractive. 
D. The ways to make the companies close their business.

Context: A U.S. dad quit his job, giving up a massive salary, after his 10-year-old daughter gave him a 22-point list outlining all the events he missed so far during the year. As the CEO of the $2 trillion global investment fund PIMCO, Mohamed El-Erian shocked the finance industry when he quit in January.
El-Erian said it was about a year ago when he was repeatedly asking his daughter to brush her teeth, but she wasn't listening. When he asked her why, she responded with a list of 22 milestones he had missed: like the first day of school and the first soccer game of the season.
""And the school year wasn't yet over,"" El-Erian wrote. ""I felt awful and got defensive: I had a good excuse for each missed event! Travel, important meetings, and urgent phone call, sudden to-dos. But it dawned on me that I was missing an infinitely more important point. My work-life balance had gotten out of whack, and the imbalance was hurting my very special relationship with my daughter. I was not making enough time for her."" El-Erian explained he was struggling with the same thing so many parents do--work-life balance.
Dads who are quitting their profit-making jobs to improve work-life balance is a subject that is getting more traction as some high-profile executive have recently written about their experiences.
Last month, former MongoDB CEO Max Schireson wrote a blog post for Time about his decision to step down from the company's top job. He wrote that he struggled to make time for his three children because he was flying around half a million kilometres a year for work.
""I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car, or when my son had an emergency surgery,"" Schireson wrote.
On an overnight flight to Texas he woke up in Arizona to discover the plane made an emergency landing and some traumatized crew members had to be replaced. He decided it was time to address his work-life balance.
Quitting is something El-Erian and Schireson were financially able to do, but El-Erian recognizes most people don't have this luxury. He hopes companies will pay attention to improving work-life balance for their employees.
El-Erian now manages ""a portfolio of part-time jobs"" that don't require as much travel. He alternates mornings with his wife taking their daughter to school and he often picks her up from school.
""So far, it's been the right decision for me,"" he wrote. ""I'm so grateful that this is providing me greater opportunity to experience key moments in my daughter's life before they're all too quickly gone."" 
 Question:El-Erian resigned from PIMCO mainly because   _  . 
A. his daughter has been missing him badly 
B. he was getting bored with the endless flights 
C. he hoped to get his daughter to listen to her 
D. he wanted to experience his daughter's milestones

Context: More than a third of the babies born this year could receive a 100th birthday message from whoever happens to be on the throne in the second decade of the 22nd century, according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It forecasts that 35% of the 826,000 people born in 2012 will live to become _ .
But a long life is not unalloyed good news. David Sinclair, head of policy and research at the International Longevity Centre UK, warned that for many the future may mean social isolation as they live longer than friends and members of their families.
""It is of course good news that so many more people are living longer,"" he said, ""but there is a big 'but1. We will be older, but in worse health, and at high risk of living alone. The other problem is that we are very poor at forward planning. We deal with the problems that are under our noses, but even problems two or three years away seem quite distant enough to put off.When you're talking about forecasts for a time half a century away and more, I see no evidence that we are putting in place the measures to deal with it.""
This year there will be 14,500 centenarians in the UK, a number which is expected to increase to 110,000 in 2035.
Women have higher life expectancies than men at every age: the likelihood of a girl born this year reaching her century is estimated to be 39%; for boys the figure is 32%.
The estimated number of female centenarians has risen from 500 in 1961 to more than 10,000 in 2010,a figure which is projected to reach 71,000 by 2035 and 276,000 by 2060.
Men are also living far longer, although their numbers are far fewer. There were an estimated 92 male centenarians in 1961 and just below 2,000 in 2010. 
 Question:What does this passage mainly talk about? 
A. A long life is not always good news. 
B. A long life also means social and physical isolation 
C. In the future, more people will live to 100 in the UK. 
D. It is good to live to 100.

Context: It is ""one of the few bright spots in the Chinese economy,"" says Zeng Ming. He is talking about e-commerce. Mr Zeng, the chief strategy officer for Alibaba, a giant Chinese Internet firm, predicts that digital transactions on his firm's platforms will top l trillion yuan ($159 billion) this year-more than Amazon's and eBay's combined. That is a bold claim, but consider what happened on Singles Sunday.
Invented a few years ago by students and seized upon by digital marketers, this festival for lonely hearts falls annually on the  llth day of the llth month (since l is the loneliest number).It is like St Valentine's Day, only worse. Singletons shower each other with tender gifts: a barrage of pearls; a storm of sweets.
This November llth they spent a surprising 19 billion yuan on Alibaba's online platforms-a fourfold increase on a year ago, and more than double what Americans spent online last Cyber Monday (the Monday after Thanksgiving, when retailers urge Americans to shop online). About 100m purchases were logged, accounting for 80% of the packages shipped that day. Couriers  were buried in parcels.
So life is good for China's e-tailers, then? Not exactly. The number of digital marketers is increasing and online sales are booming. Consumers are enjoying lower prices, better service and more variety. The problem? The pressure on profits in Chinese e-commerce is worse than in America, reckons Elinor Leung of CLSA, a broker. ""Almost no one makes money,"" she says.
The fiercest battles are being fought between online retailers and their bricks-and-mortar  rivals.Dangdang, a firm. that resembles Amazon,.and 360buy, another online retailer, have cut prices fiercely. Tencent, a cash-rich online giant known for its instant-messaging software, is splashing out to win market share. 360buy has also just raised $400m from investors to do the same. But it is unclear how much longer such firms can burn through capital. 
 Question:How many packages were shipped on November ll th from Alibaba's online platforms? 
A. About 80 million. 
B. About 100 million. 
C. About 125 million. 
D. About 180 million.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture

Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption

Context: Food prices have risen sharply over the past few years. The good news is that the rate of increase has slowed. The bad news is that prices will not go down anytime soon.
Also,the rate of global agricultural production is slowing. Yet it needs to increase 60% over the next 40 years to feed a growing world population.
These are among the findings from the OECDFAO(the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development & the Food and Agriculture Organization)Agricultural Outlook 2012-2021.
FAO DirectorGeneral Jose Graziano da Silva spoke at a news conference in Rome when the report was released. Mr.Da Silva said that,not surprisingly,the world's poorest people will feel the greatest effects of higher prices.
""For the millions and millions of extremely poor people, the effects of high food prices are clear--they might have to change their diets,usually to ones with poorer nutrition quality, ""he said.
In middleincome countries, people are gaining weight as they eat fewer fruits and vegetables and more of the cheaper but less nutritious foods.
The report also shows that farmers in poorer countries will be leading efforts to feed an expected 9,000,000,000 people by 2050.The outlook predicts that farmers in Latin America,the Caribbean and subSaharan Africa will drive agricultural production in the future.
Angel Gurria,SecretaryGeneral of the OECD,said:""We can feed 9,000,000,000 people by 2050 on this planet. But we have to organize ourselves better."" But there are plenty of challenges.Onefourth of all agricultural land is damaged. Many countries face water shortages .And experts believe climate change is driving increasingly unusual weather patterns.
The report says farmers need to use more growing methods that can't cause damage to the environment.At the same time,it says governments should end economically harmful supports and spend more money to increase agricultural production.Mr.Gurria says rich and poor nations need to treat agriculture more like a business.
""In many cases,agriculture is related in people's minds to the poorest. It's related to aid. It's related to very poor living conditions,etc. We have got to shake that image away,""he said. 
 Question:What can be done to deal with the slow agricultural production? 
A. Improving the growing methods. 
B. Finding more agricultural land. 
C. Preventing governments' involvement. 
D. Improving farmers' living conditions.

Context: China and Japan are respectively the world's secondandthirdlargest economies. In 2008, China-Japan trade grew to $266.4 billion, a rise of 12.5 percent on 2007, making China and Japan the top two-way trading partners. China was also the biggest destination for Japanese exports in 2009.
The relationship between China and Japan has been  _ at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge itswartimepast to the satisfaction of China. China joined other Asian countries, such asSouth Korea,North KoreaandSingapore, in criticizing Japanese history textbooks that whitenJapanese war crimesinWorld War II. They claimed that the rise ofmilitarismbecame evident in Japanese politics. Muchanti-Japanese emotion has risen, because of the increasing feelings ofChinese nationalismand former Prime MinisterJunichiro Koizumi's visits to theYasukuni Shrine . Although Koizumi openly declared---in a statement made on April 22, 2005 in Jakarta--- ""deep regret"" overJapan's wartime crimes, many Chinese observers regard the apology as insufficient and not consistent with the action.
Sino-Japan relations changed slightly after Shinzo Abebecame thePrime Minister of Japanin September 2006, and a joint historical study conducted by China and Japan released a report in 2010 which pointed toward new agreement on the issue ofWorld War II-era violent action.
However, there also remains the dispute  over the Diaoyu Islands, which resulted in clashes between Taiwanese (Chinese) protesters and the Japanese government in April 2005. The incident led to anti-Japanese protests and violence across Mainland China, from BeijingtoShanghai, laterGuangzhou,ShenzhenandShenyang. In August 2012, Hong Kong activists landed on one of the disputed Diaoyu Islands, and Japanese nationalists responded by landing on the island the following week. The incidents set off the largest-scale anti-Japanese protests in China for decades in which protesters vandalized Japanese shops and cars. On the 14th of September relations worsened even further in response to Japan's announcement of plans to buy the island from its private owners. The news resulted in the Chinese government sending six surveillance  ships to the islands and further anti-Japanese protests in which protesters attacked the Japanese embassies in Shanghai and Beijing. 
 Question:Which of the following can improve the Sino-Japan relations? 
A. Strengthening their economic tie. 
B. Reaching an agreement on their disputes. 
C. Stopping vandalizing Japanese shops and cars. 
D. Shinzo Abe becoming Japanese prime minister. 
 Answer: B
Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair.

A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.

 Answer: C
Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B
Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""

What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT."" 
 Question:The price of the knives was cut down by half because   _  . 
A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap 
D. the knives were produced in one factory

Context: Advertising can be a service to the customer. This is true when advertisements give reliable information about the goods advertised. Such information is needed if the customer is to make a sensible choice when he buys. It is useful in that it lets him know of the kinds of goods in the shops. Printed advertisements do this job best. Customers can collect them and compare them. They can be taken along to shops and their claims can be checked against the actual goods in the shops.
however, some advertisements are not very useful to the customer. Instead of helping him to satisfy his real needs, they set out to make him want things. They set out to create a need. These advertisements are cleverly done. The people who produce them understand our weaknesses. They set out to make us believe that what they advertise will make us cleverer, prettier and more handsome, if only we use it. Actually, it is our money they are after and we should be on guard.
Some advertisements mislead customers by using part of the truth to suggest something false, and it is skillfully made to give that idea to the careless reader, listener or viewer.
At its best advertising can be useful to the customer. At its worst it can mislead him. Many newspapers check on the goods for which the advertisements made claims. Most newspapers are very careful about the small advertisements, which try to sell goods directly to the readers by post. Many newspapers print information about this on their small advertisement pages. Advertising has become a very big business, and good firms in it do all they can to make sure it is conducted with some attention to truth. This is a help to the customer. But the best way is for customers to be on the lookout. 
 Question:Advertisements that play on our weaknesses make us   _  . 
A. desire things we do not need 
B. purchase the goods we need 
C. attracted by them 
D. become loyal reader, listener or viewer 
 Answer: A

Context: A few years ago, a company called Space Marketing came up with a plan to send a mile-long advertisement into space. To advertising agencies  , it would have been ""a dream come true"". However, advertising standards agencies finally decided not to allow Space Marketing to go ahead with their plans and they were forced to give them up.
Space may indeed be the final place for advertisers, because on Earth we are already surrounded by advertising wherever we are and whatever we are doing. Apart from the obvious adverts that we see every day on TV, and in newspapers and magazines, there is a whole ' _ ' of advertising messages for our attention. There are ads that we see on the side of the bus we catch to work, for example. And what about the logos   we see on the clothing of the people we walk past in the streets?
Most of the time, we are probably not even aware of   these less obvious advertising methods, but that doesn't mean that they don't work. Take 'product placement', for example. You are in a cinema, watching the latest Hollywood movie. Look carefully at the make of car your favorite actor is driving. And what about his watch? Can you see what brand it is? Chances are, you can, and the company that owns the brand is likely to have paid thousands for it to appear in the film.
So, whether Space Marketing finally succeeds in sending ads into space or not is perhaps less important than it might seem. This would not change a thing. Our everyday lives are already strongly influenced by advertising whether we realize it or not. 
 Question:What does the author suggest at the end of the text? 
A. We live in a world of advertising. 
B. We've changed a lot because of advertising. 
C. Space Marketing leads in the advertising industry. 
D. Space ads will mark the beginning of a new world.

Context: News that Microsoft made a $44.6 billion bid to buy Yahoo resulted in heated discussions made by many Internet users. Here are some responses:
Diane Burke of Weeks bury, Kentucky
I think it would definitely be an interesting combination. Everyone recognizes the names Yahoo and Microsoft, but everyone also says, ""Did you Google it?"" Such a catchphrase   is going to be hard to beat.
Shaun Carney of Laurelville, Ohio
I think the merger   will provide more competitions for Google. I don't think the merger will allow Microsoft to develop faster than Google, though. I believe the increased competition this merger brings will force Google to stay on top of its game by offering more fresh and original Internet tools and expanding on the tools it already offers.
Toni Suarez of Hacienda Heights, California
I view the merger as a necessary element in preventing a monopolization  . Perhaps it would bring better high technology innovations to e-mail and help in researching and developing a better Internet!
Rick R. of Edgewater, Florida
It sounds like a disaster to me. If this were to happen, I would stop using my Yahoo e-mail account because I don't like the feeling of Microsoft spying upon my business. I will sign up for Google.
Antonio Glosser of Kansas City, Missouri
Right now, Yahoo offers a lot of features and tools at no cost for all different levels of Internet users. Microsoft seeks nothing but profit. Undoubtedly, they'll do nothing other than find ways to start removing Yahoo's formerly non-priced features. Microsoft's greed will ruin the great thing that Yahoo currently is. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage? 
A. Shaun's attitude towards Google is passive. 
B. Toni believes the Internet will have a promising future. 
C. Rick will support Google after the merger. 
D. Antonio is afraid that the merger will cost Yahoo's free features.

Context: Dear Mr. Smith,
I am seeking an opportunity to work with World Destiny as a Computer Systems Manager. My professional experience and my awareness of your high reputation and great achievements have led me to want to work for World Destiny.
Since 1998 I have focused on computer-system design and training. As Systems Administrator for Newport Museum for the past two years, I have directed accounting, capital campaign and publication production. We designed the system from scratch, developing all applications, policies, procedures, and training programs. I was well prepared for such a challenge by my previous positions as a Systems Support Specialist and MicroComputer Assistant for the Imperial Corporation of America.
Over the years, I have worked with Novell, using programs including dBase, Wordstar and Microsoft Word. This familiarity with a variety of hardware and software has helped me to get up to speed on nearly any computer with a minimum training period.
Additional experience in other fields also adds my value to World Destiny. As a Market Research Coordinator for Cushman & Wakefield of California, I not only researched and maintained  a comprehensive database of Silicon Valley, but also produced statistical and written reports that support Cushman & Wakefield's reputation. Previously, I organized companywide annual sales meetings for Qualogy, Inc.
Mr. Smith, while this experience more than qualifies me to join any number of successful companies, it is my personal goals that lead to my interest in being part of the World Destiny team. I believe my computer, promotional, and organizational skills, fueled by my beliefs, make World Destiny and me right for each other. Can we arrange an interview at your earliest convenience? I will call within the next week to arrange a meeting.
Sincerely, Beth Henning

""Parent meetings form a clear monthly pattern,"" says Mildred Foreman, Guidance Director. ""This pattern stays much the same from year to year. The busy months are October, March and May."" 
September starts rather slowly. Few parents come in. Most of them want to discuss the schedules. October brings many behaviour problems. Some parents are called in. Others come by themselves.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle.

A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT."" 
 Question:The price of the knives was cut down by half because   _  . 
A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap

Context: Special trees that grow faster, fight pollution, produce better wood, and even sense chemical attacks are being planted by scientists in the US.
When 40 per cent of Hawaii's US$14 million-a-year papaya  industry was destroyed by a virus five years ago, work began on creating genetically engineered trees.
Researchers successfully introduced seeds that were designed to resist the virus.Since then, more and more people have been testing genetically engineered trees.Some researchers put special bacteria into trees to help them grow faster and produce better wood.Others are trying to create trees that can clean polluted soil.Meanwhile fruit farmers are looking for trees that are strong enough to resist worms, and paper companies want trees that produce more wood and therefore more paper.
The Pentagon   even gave the researchers US$500,000 this year after they developed a pine tree that changes its colours if it senses a chemical attack.So far, the poplar, eucalyptus  , apple and coffee trees are among those being engineered.All this can be done today because we have a better understanding of tree genomes  .
However, some people fear that the genetically engineered trees will cause dangerous results.They are worried that the new trees will breed with natural species and change the balance of the forest environment.
""It could be destructive,"" said Jim Diamond, an environmentalist. ""Trees are what is left of our natural environment and home to many endangered species.""
But researchers insist that science could give nature a fighting chance against both natural and man-made dangers.They hope to answer the critics by stopping the new trees from breeding, so their effect on the environment can be controlled. 
 Question:Which of the following was probably the first kind of trees being engineered? 
A. Papaya. 
B. Pine. 
C. Apple. 
D. Poplar.

""It could be destructive,"" said Jim Diamond, an environmentalist. ""Trees are what is left of our natural environment and home to many endangered species.""
But researchers insist that science could give nature a fighting chance against both natural and man-made dangers.They hope to answer the critics by stopping the new trees from breeding, so their effect on the environment can be controlled. 
 Question:Which kind of tree is not the ones that scientists are planting in the US? 
A. Trees that worms can't hurt. 
B. Genetically engineered trees. 
C. Trees that can resist wind better. 
D. Trees that can protect themselves at a chemical attack. 
 Answer: C
Context: Special trees that grow faster, fight pollution, produce better wood, and even sense chemical attacks are being planted by scientists in the US.
When 40 per cent of Hawaii's US$14 million-a-year papaya  industry was destroyed by a virus five years ago, work began on creating genetically engineered trees.
Researchers successfully introduced seeds that were designed to resist the virus.Since then, more and more people have been testing genetically engineered trees.Some researchers put special bacteria into trees to help them grow faster and produce better wood.Others are trying to create trees that can clean polluted soil.Meanwhile fruit farmers are looking for trees that are strong enough to resist worms, and paper companies want trees that produce more wood and therefore more paper.

Context: By 2050, half of the world's population will live in the tropics--the  ly warm belt that circles the globe--according to State of the Tropics, a report released today. Rapid population growth, along with economic growth, means that the region's influence will grow in coming decades, the authors of the 500-page work predict.
The project, first launched in 2011, aimed to answer one significant question: Is life in the tropics improving? To find out, the researchers analyzed environmental, social, and economic indicators collected over 6 decades. It finds that the region has made ""extraordinary progress"" in many areas. For example, more people have access to safe drinking water, and the number of protected areas is increasing. The tropics also have outperformed the rest of the world in economic growth over the past 30 years.
However, some challenges remain. Investment in research and development, for example, has increased cautiously, but tropical nations still invest less than the rest of the world. ""As a proportion of GDP the Rest of the World invests almost four times as much in research and development than the Tropics."" concludes the report.
The report also includes a new analysis of how climate change will affect the region. Many plant and animal species are moving poleward in an attempt to stay within their preferred environmental conditions in the tropics, the authors write. However, some organisms may not be able to keep pace with the changing conditions, they predict. As a result, they can experience population declines or go extinct.
In addition, an expanded tropical zone also threatens health and safety issues, the authors warn. As regions become more suitable to insects such as mosquitoes and ticks, the spread of insect-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, and Lyme disease could rise, causing a burden to human health and the economy. 
Bruna, a researcher, says he sees a lot to be concerned about in the report. ""While we've made incredible advances in some areas, I think the risks for the tropics that are highlighted in this report are things that we really need to be concerned about.""

Context: London, April 28---The Man Group, a British hedge fund, is betting that investors will want to read more than the latest how-to- get -rich-quick business book.
In a five-year deal worth roughly $3.6 million announced last week, Man has agreed to sponsor the Booker Prize for Fiction, which will be renamed the Man Booker Prize. Since creating the award in 1969, Booker P.L.G., a British food group, in June 2000, executives began considering attracting outside sponsors. Man will be the first of these. Bill Grimsey, the chief of the Big Food Group, saw little business sense in a link between a food supplier and a literary prize, explained Dotti Irving, a spokeswoman for the Booker Prize foundation.
Such dissimilarities   have not reduced Man's enthusiasm for the prize which is expected to be open for the first time to American authors. David Browne, a spokesman for Man, said most of the firm's investors are high-net-worth individuals who appreciate literature. ""The people who buy hedge funds,"" Mr. Browne said, ""also read.""
Under the new agreement, authors will get more money. The winner of the annual prize, to be awarded in October, will receive $73,000 , up from $30,000 the Australian writer Peter Carey won last year for his novel ""True History of the Kelley Gang.""
The six short-listed authors will each receive $3,600, up from $1,500. Having a hedge fund as a backer apparently has its perks. . 
 Question:What can be inferred from the article? 
A. Bill Grimsey decided to open the prize for American authors 
B. ""How-to-get-rich-quick"" business was written by Peter Carey. 
C. Under the agreement, the Booker Prize will be sponsored only by Man. 
D. If you win the prize, you will get $73,000 next October

 Answer: A
Context: You and your friends are settling into your seats. The new Spider- Man movie is about to start and you've got the snacks: soda and popcorn. Food is part of what makes the movie fun.
     Just as the lights go out, you catch a slight smell of ...tuna fish?! You turn your head, searching for the source. Then you spot him: A couple rows back, some guy is enjoying a tuna fish sandwich. How's he get that in here? You wonder. Then you remember how much you paid for your snacks.
     What invites the unwelcome outside food is probably the price. Why pay $5 for a bag of M&Ms when you can get them for a dollar at the corner store?
     Earlier this year, a Michigan man decided to fight for his right to snack. Joshua Thompson is suing  his local theatre after it banned outside food. He argues the ban breaks a Michigan law that prevents business from charging extremely high prices. However, most legal  experts believe Thompson has little chance of winning his case though he does have a point: 85 percents out of every dollar of treats a movie theatre sells is pure profit  . 
     The truth is that movie theatres are more in the snack business than the movie business. A huge part of the ticket income goes to the Hollywood studio. This makes sense, since the studio have to pay the costs of movie production and advertising. But that often doesn't leave much cash for the theater, which also has its own running costs. If customers stopped buying food, owners would have to raise ticket prices even higher. 
     Of course, there's another reason to think twice before bringing food into the movies: It's against the rules. Breaking those rules can be unpleasant consequences, too. Some theatres will kick you out if they catch you. Even without the threat of punishment, we should follow rules all the time-----out of respect. 
     Here's a good idea: Eat before the movie. 
 Question:Hoe does the author feel about bringing outside food? 
A. It is unacceptable 
B. It is convenient 
C. It is great fun 
D. It is lawful.

Context: A company advertised in the newspaper for a sales position. Details of the prerequisite  , salary and benefits were given. It was also clearly stated that applicants needed to take an aptitude test   and an interview. However, looking at the whole advertisement, one could not find any contact information of the company.
Most interested applicants thought that it was the company's HR department's carelessness or a printing error. They therefore waited patiently for the newspaper to publish an amendment. But instead of waiting for the newspaper to publish the company details, another three applicants took the initiative to find out the company's contact information themselves.
Tim did a search on the Internet. By typing the company's name, he easily obtained all the information including its contact number. Lisa called up the local telephone number search service and found out the company's office number. She called up the office and got the required contact information. Donna put in a greater effort in her search. She remembered seeing a poster by the same company in the city so she drove all the way down and made a few rounds to search for it. She finally found it together with the company's contact information.
Three days after that advertisement was published in the newspaper, most interested applicants were still waiting eagerly for an amendment. On the other hand, the application letters and resumes of Tim, Lisa and Donna had already reached the hands of the company's HR manager. They were then called up for an interview. During the interview, all went well and immediately they were hired. The three of them were a little surprised at how fast things went on. They were expecting for an aptitude test as stated in the advertisement. The HR director answered them, smiling, ""Our test is hidden in the advertisement itself. To be a good salesperson in this age, he or she has to be broad-minded and very importantly, does not follow rigid   steps or rules. You are all clever and agile. In a short time, you've managed to find ways of contacting us. It shows clearly that you have passed the test with flying colors!""
The fools sit around waiting for their chances whereas the wise actively take actions with great initiative   . 
 Question:The writer wants to tell us through this passage that   _  . 
A. no contact information seen in an advertisement might not be the company's mistake 
B. applicants should be careful not to be fooled by the company's advertisement

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""

Context: TOKYO-- At first glance, Japanese cellphones are young people's favorites, with elegant design and quick access to the Internet. However, despite years of competition in overseas markets, Japan's cellphone makers have little presence beyond the country's shores.
The only Japanese cellphone maker with any meaningful global share is Sony Ericsson, and that company is a London-based joint venture between a Japanese electronics maker and a Swedish telecommunications firm.
And Sony Ericsson has been hit by big losses. Its market share was just 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009, behind Nokia of Finland, Samsung Electronics and LG of South Korea, and Motorola of Illinois.
This year, Mr Natsuno, who developed a popular wireless Internet service called i-Mode, invited some of the best minds in the field to debate how Japanese cellphones could go global.
""The most amazing thing about Japan is that even the average person out there will have a very advanced phone, ""said Mr Natsuno. Japan has 100 million users of advanced third-generation smart phones, twice the number of the United States, a much larger market. Many Japanese rely on their phones, not a PC, for Internet access.
Indeed, Japanese cellphone makers thought they had positioned themselves to dominate the age of digital data. But they were a little too clever. In the 1990s, they set a standard for the second-generation network that was refused everywhere else. Then Japan quickly adopted a third-generation standard in 2001. However, it made Japanese phones too advanced for most markets.
Several Japanese companies are now considering a push into overseas markets, including NEC. Panasonic, Sharp, Toshiba and Fujitsu are said to be planning similar moves.
""Japanese cellphone makers need to either look overseas, or exit the business"", said Kenshi Tazaki, a managing vice president at the consulting firm Gartner Japan. 
 Question:Which of the following would be the best title for the passage? 
A. Japanese cellphone companies are unsuccessful. 
B. Japan has more cellphone users than the US. 
C. Japanese cellphone industry intends to expand overseas markets. 
D. Going global--a difficult task for Japanese companies.

The Q80 Inspiration here in Paris is an excellent piece of work, perhaps a concept elegant enough to make us forget that Infiniti's former Hong Kong-based president, Johan de Nysschen, moved to take over General Motors' Cadillac car brand in July and Infiniti chairman Andy Palmer is the new CEO at Aston Martin, the British luxury car brand.
The Q80, if it becomes reality, will be brought to market by Infiniti's new boss, former BMW (another famous car brand )executive Roland Kruger. He should focus on this, at least until he is head-hunted to another company.
The Q80 Inspiration is a low and sexy four-door fastback, and it is also a showcase for technology - from autonomous driving to eco-friendly power trains. Here in Paris, the Infiniti people say the hybrid drive in this concept suggest exactly where the brand is going in the future.
The company says the Q80 speaks to how Infiniti plans to pull people into more expensive cars - cars that compete with the Porsche Panamera, for instance.
Alfonso Albaisa, Infiniti Executive Design Director, said the car ""delivers feminine elegance and muscular menace in equal measure and strikes big in terms of styling, craftsmanship, choice of materials and attention to detail.""
Most importantly, for luxury cars buyers who are increasingly puzzled by all the technology, the designers focused on making things simple.
""There is a tendency with modern design that every time you add interior features and technology you add complexity,"" said Albaisa, pointing to the concept's easy-to -understand -and -operate infotainment interface.
As for power, the Q80 Inspiration gets 550 horsepower from a twin turbocharged 3.0-litre V-6 combined with a hybrid electric power train. Fuel economy could be as good as 5.5 litres/100 km. 
 Question:In the future Infiniti will pay more attention to   _  . 
A. details 
B. craftsmanship 
C. energy conservation 
D. materials

Context: ""What is success""? Mr. Black asked his 6th grade business class. It was his opening conversation for the first class of the term.
""Success is riding in a sweet car, watching an 80-inch(  TV, and living in a place with at least twelve rooms."" One student answered, earning laughs from all the students.
Mr. Black smiled, but shook his head. ""Tom, that is excess . That is not success.""
""How about being able to provide for your family?"" A blonde girl named Sandy in the front suggested as an answer.
""Now we're getting closer,"" Mr. Black smiled, ""but try thinking about what you need and what you want.""
""Getting everything you want."" Tom shouted out an answer again, trying for more laughs.
Mr. Black sighed ."" I believe we've already talked about excess versus(...) success.""
""Getting everything you need, but some of what you want?"" James, sitting in the back wondered aloud.
""Quite right!"" Mr. Black clapped. ""Success is getting everything you need and some of what you want. The more you get that you want, the more successful you are. You do reach a point where you are living in excess, though.""
""What does this have to do with business?"" Tom asked. It seemed if it wasn't funny, he wasn't happy.
""Well, Tom, think of it this way: the point of business is to make a living to support your family. Once you have properly seen to   their needs, you can then seen to getting the extras that you want.""
""What if I don't have a family?"" he continued to be difficult.
""Then you have to provide for yourself, a family of one.""
""He has goldfish to think about!"" Peter, Tom's friend, shouted out.
""Then he needs to provide for a family of one with a fishbowl."" Mr. Black corrected himself.
Tom nodded, satisfied with that answer.
""So in the next nine weeks, we're going to study basic business situations, like having a checking account and understanding credit cards .""

 Answer: A
Context: A U.S. dad quit his job, giving up a massive salary, after his 10-year-old daughter gave him a 22-point list outlining all the events he missed so far during the year. As the CEO of the $2 trillion global investment fund PIMCO, Mohamed El-Erian shocked the finance industry when he quit in January.
El-Erian said it was about a year ago when he was repeatedly asking his daughter to brush her teeth, but she wasn't listening. When he asked her why, she responded with a list of 22 milestones he had missed: like the first day of school and the first soccer game of the season.
""And the school year wasn't yet over,"" El-Erian wrote. ""I felt awful and got defensive: I had a good excuse for each missed event! Travel, important meetings, and urgent phone call, sudden to-dos. But it dawned on me that I was missing an infinitely more important point. My work-life balance had gotten out of whack, and the imbalance was hurting my very special relationship with my daughter. I was not making enough time for her."" El-Erian explained he was struggling with the same thing so many parents do--work-life balance.
Dads who are quitting their profit-making jobs to improve work-life balance is a subject that is getting more traction as some high-profile executive have recently written about their experiences.
Last month, former MongoDB CEO Max Schireson wrote a blog post for Time about his decision to step down from the company's top job. He wrote that he struggled to make time for his three children because he was flying around half a million kilometres a year for work.
""I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car, or when my son had an emergency surgery,"" Schireson wrote.
On an overnight flight to Texas he woke up in Arizona to discover the plane made an emergency landing and some traumatized crew members had to be replaced. He decided it was time to address his work-life balance.
Quitting is something El-Erian and Schireson were financially able to do, but El-Erian recognizes most people don't have this luxury. He hopes companies will pay attention to improving work-life balance for their employees.
El-Erian now manages ""a portfolio of part-time jobs"" that don't require as much travel. He alternates mornings with his wife taking their daughter to school and he often picks her up from school.
""So far, it's been the right decision for me,"" he wrote. ""I'm so grateful that this is providing me greater opportunity to experience key moments in my daughter's life before they're all too quickly gone."" 
 Question:El-Erian resigned from PIMCO mainly because   _  . 
A. his daughter has been missing him badly 
B. he was getting bored with the endless flights 
C. he hoped to get his daughter to listen to her 
D. he wanted to experience his daughter's milestones 
 Answer: D
Context: Salesman Ramesh lived in the southern part of India. He got his first assignment in the month of June, the start of the rainy season in the area. He was given a list of local laundry owners whom he had to approach and sell products to. He was scared and thought he wouldn't be able to fulfill the task, but he accepted the challenge as he had no other choice.
    The next day he started approaching the laundry owners, and within 15 days he got a really nice response. Most of them purchased his products, but they borrowed money from Ramesh to buy the products. Everyone promised to pay him back within the next 15 days.
    During the last week of June amidst heavy showers, he started visiting the laundry owners to collect money. Upon visiting half of them, he realized he hadn't collected a penny.
    After almost 14 days, on a bright sunny Monday morning, he started visiting the laundry owners once again. Suddenly, by noon Ramesh realized that he had collected the payments from almost 50% of the owners.
    He worked hard throughout the day, and by the end of the day he had completed 90% of his target for June and July. At last, he became the ""star performer"" for the months of June and July.
    Why did the laundry owners look at the sky and tell him to come the next day when Ramesh visited them? He went to a laundry owner and asked him the question. The owner said, ""This is the month of the rainy season and we have to wash the clothes, dry them off and iron them before handing them over to customers. If the sun doesn't shine, how can we dry our clothes and earn money to pay you back?"" Ramesh then realized that it was his patience and endurance that kept him going and ultimately helped him achieve success.
    Like Ramesh, each one of us should realize that apart from being honest and hard-working, if we can keep our patience, we are inching up the ladder of success. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE? 
A. June is the start of the rainy season in the southern part of India. 
B. To sell products, Ramesh helped his customers to wash clothes. 
C. Ramesh became the ""star performer"" for the next three months. 
D. A minority of customers paid for the products using the money from Ramesh.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees 
 Answer: C
Context: Consumers are being confused and misled by the hodge-podge  of environmental claims made by household products, according to a ""green labeling"" study published by Consumers International Friday.
Among the report's more unacceptalbe findings - a German fertilizer described itself as ""earthworm friendly""; a brand of flour said it was ""non-polluting"" and a British toilet paper claimed to be ""environmentally friendlier"".
The study was written and researched by Britain's National Consumer Council (NCC) for lobby group Consumers International. It was funded by the German and Dutch governments and the European Commission.
""While many good and useful claims are being made, it is clear that there is a long way to go in ensuring shoppers are adequately informed about the environmental impacts they buy,"" said Consumers International director, Anna Fielder.
The 10-country study surveyed product packaging in Britain, Western Europe, Scandinavia and the United States. It found that products sold in Germany and the United Kingdom made the most environmental claims on average.
The report focused on claims made by specific products, such as detergent  , insect sprays and some garden products. It did not test claims, but compared them to labeling guidelines set by the International Standards Organization (ISO) in September, 1999. Researchers documented claims of environmental friendliness made by about 2,000 products and found many too vague or too misleading to meet ISO standards.
""Many products had specially designed labels to make them seem environmentally friendly, but in fact many of these symbols mean nothing,"" said report researcher Philip Page.
""Laundry detergents made the most number of claims with 158. Household cleaners were second with 145 separate claims, while paints were third on our list with 73. The high numbers show how confusing it must be for consumers to sort the true from the misleading,"" he said.
The ISO labeling standards ban vague or misleading claims on product packaging, because terms such as ""environmentally friendly"" and ""non-polluting"" cannot be verified. ""What we are now pushing for is to have multinational corporations meet the standards set by the ISO,"" said Page. 
 Question:According to the passage, the NCC found it unacceptable that   _  . 
A. all the products surveyed claim to meet ISO standards 
B. the claims made by products are often unclear and deceiving 
C. consumers would believe many of the manufacturers' claims 
D. few products actually prove to be environment friendly

Context: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the eleventh largest nation in Europe. England, Wales and Scotland make up the island of Great Britain, which takes up most of the Britain Isles. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are mountainous. The highest mountain is Ben Nevis in Scotland. Plains and valleys cover much of England. The British climate is mild.
About 58 million people live in the United Kingdom. Few other countries are so crowded. Four out of five people live in cities such as Belfast, Glasgow, and London. London is the capital. Great Britain grows half of the food it needs. Its industries help to pay for the food that is bought from abroad. The United Kingdom manufactures a wide range of goods. Service industries, such as tourism, that provide services rather than producing goods, are increasing. Traditional industries, such as coal mining, are declining. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the statements is true? 
A. Great Britain grows all of the food it needs. 
B. The United Kingdom manufactures a narrow range of goods. 
C. The speed of tourism in UK is increasing faster than producing goods. 
D. The coal mining is also increasing fast. 
 Answer: C
Context: When you buy a T-shirt, or a fur coat in a store, it often carries a label telling who made it or from what store it was bought. Instead, some labels show the dress is famous and it is very expensive, so buyers secretly wish they could be carried forever. On the other hand, buyers who deal with the cheapest products would be pleased to be away with labels  _ .
However, there is another label more important than the one showing from which store the dress was bought. When a person buys a fur coat, or a jacket from a store, a label telling what the product is made of should be carried to it.
The label is required by law. Besides telling what the product on show is made of, the label should be in clear English and be where one can find it easily. The information on the label must be true.
The reason for this is that most buyers today aren't expert enough to know exactly what kind of fur or material they are buying. The buyers must believe in the store that sells the products or in what the label says. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE? 
A. A T-shirt seldom carries a label. 
B. A fur coat with a high price often carries a false label. 
C. A label only says what material the product is made of. 
D. Not all buyers know the materials they are buying.

Context: If you go to Finland, you'll be surprised to find how ""foolish"" the Finnish people are.
Take the taxi drivers for example. Taxis in Finland are mostly high class Benz with a fare   of two US dollars a kilometer. You can go anywhere in one, tell the driver to drop you at any place, say that you have some business to attend to, and then get off without paying your fare. And the driver would not show the least sign of worry.
The dining rooms in all big hotels not only serve their guests, but also outside diners. Hotel guests have their meals free, so their good faith is to wave their registration card to the waiter. With such a loose check, you can easily use any old registration card to take a couple of friends and dine free of charge.
With so many loopholes   in everyday life, surely Finland must be a heaven to those who love to take ""pretty advantages"". But the strange things is, all the taxi-passengers would always come back to pay their fare after they have attended to their business; not a single outsider has ever been found in the free hotel dining rooms. As the Finns always act on good faith and always show an attitude of ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" in everything they do, so to live in such a society has turned everyone into a real ""gentleman"". In a society of such high moral practice, what need is there for people to take precautions   against others? 
 Question:The sentences ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" show that   _  . 
A. the Finns are foolish 
B. the Finns take things seriously 
C. the Finns are busy making money for the family 
D. the Finns never take precaution against others 
 Answer: B
Context: The Government should raise taxes on air travel and high-polluting cars in order to help the environment, an important committee of MPs  has said. It also said that the 70 mph speed limit on motorways should be reduced or enforced to bring down the amount of carbon dioxide given off by cars The House of Common Enviromental Audit committee's latest report said that transport was the only sector of the UK where carbon  _ have continued to rise since 1990.
It said it was time for the Government to make demand for cheap air impossible by raising air passenger tax. Emissions from air traffic have risen by 5 times as much since 1900 and are continuing to rise.
The committee welcomed the recent introduction of changed car tax, which means that the lowest-carbon cars pay no road tax, while gas-guzzling 4x4s pay an increased rate of PS210. However, the MPs say it doesn't go far enough and are calling for a top limit of PS1,800 with lower limit of PS200.
Committee chairman Tim Yeo said : ""Air travel in particular is the fastest growing source of CO2, with emissions more than five times since 1900. The Government should take much more decisive action to reduce the difference of income favor of trains, buses, and lower carbon cars and lorries.""
Friends of the Earth's senior organizer Tony Bosworth said: ""Emissions from transport are still rising and forecasts suggest they will carry on rising for years to come.""
""Tinkering around the edges is no longer enough to deal with the greatest threat the world faces."" A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""Dealing with carbon emissions in transport is a key problem."" 
 Question:Which of the following is the best title for the passage? 
A. Transport is the biggest polluter 
B. Raise taxes on air travel and high-polluting cars 
C. Deal with greatest threat the world faces 
D. Air travel in particular is the fastest growing sources of CO2

Context: Who are the top students in the world, do you know? Last week the Organization for Economic Co-operation Development   picked the best students in the world. They are Finnish  . The OECD gave a test to 280 000 15-year-old students from more than 40 countries and regions   last year. The OECD wanted to know how well students were doing at school.
Finnish students were No. 1 in the reading test and second in maths after Hong Kong students. Those from Japan and Finland were top in science. In the problem solving, Finnish students came second to those from South Korea. The test also showed Finland had more top students than the other countries.
Finns   of your age have done a really good job but don't have a sense of envy. You can learn from them. Most Finnish students make good use of the Internet. Of course not for computer games, but for doing more exercises and finding out more information.
Libraries are also important. Finland spends a lot of money on them. Many students have a free card. They read for at least one or two hours a day.
What do you usually do on the Internet? How often do you go to libraries?

A. South Korea. 
B. Hong Kong.

 Answer: C
Context: A Samoan airline says that it is the world's first carrier to charge passengers by their weight. Samoa Air, which opened in 2012, asks passengers to give their personal weight during booking, which is then charged according to the length of a flight. The customers will also be weighed just before they board the plane.
""It is believed that all people throughout the world are the same size,"" Samoa Air CEO Chris Langton said. ""Airplanes always run on weight, not seats.""
""There is no doubt in my mind that this is the concept of the future. This is the fairest way of your travelling with your family or yourself.""
Though the airline introduced the plan last November, it caught people's attention last week when the carrier began international flights to neighboring American Samoa.
Almost at the same time, a Norwegian economist, Bharat Bhatta, published a report suggesting that airlines should charge obese passengers more.
The Pacific Islands contain some of the world's most common countries for obesity, many ranking in the top 10, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Samoa is ranked number four, with 59.6 percent of the population considered obese, said the most recent WHO report.
According to Samoa Air's latest schedule, the airline charges up to $0.57 per kg for flights in Samoa and $1.03 per kg for its only international flight to American Samoa, around 250 miles.
Children under 12 are charged 75 percent of the adult rate, with fares also based on weight. Any overweight baggage is calculated at the same rate as the passenger's personal weight.
The plan could actually prove cheaper in some cases, such as for families travelling with small children, and Langton said customer reaction has mainly been ""amazingly positive"".
The idea of charging passengers by weight has been hotly discussed before, and in the US some airlines require those who do not fit into a seat comfortably to buy a second seat. 
 Question:What does the text mainly tell us? 
A. 59.6% of Samoans are considered obese. 
B. Samoa Air introduces pay-by-weight pricing. 
C. Airlines should charge obese passengers more. 
D. Baggage must be calculated as passengers' weight.

The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth.
An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, ""the worst came to the worst"". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door.
The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced.
Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank. He says the plant seeds would only be used when all other seeds are gone for some reason. Norwayfirst proposed the idea in the 1980s. But security concerns delayed the plan. At that time, the Soviet Union was meeting inRomeof the Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the above passage? 
A. The government of Norwaywill perform the project alone. 
B. Seeds to be collected there were produced ten thousands years ago. 
C. Spitsbergen is chosen because it is free of the threat unclear war forever. 
D. Temperature is a major consideration when choosing the storage place.

Context: Early in the 16thcentury men were trying to reach Asia by travelling west from Europe. In order to find Asia they had to find a way past South Africa. The man who finally found the way from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific was Ferdinand Magellan.
Magellan sailed from Seville in August 1519 with five ships and about 280 men. Fourteen months later, after spending the severe   winter on the coast of Patagonia, he discovered the channel   which is now called Magellan Straits. In November 1520, after many months of dangers from rocks and storms, the three remaining ships entered the ocean on the other side of South America.
They then continued, hoping to reach Asia. But they didn't see any land until they reached the islands off the coast of Asia. Before they arrived at these islands, later known as Philippines, men were dying of starvation. While they were in the Philippines., Magellan was killed in battle.
The remaining officers then had to get back to Spain. They decided to sail around Africa. After many difficulties, one ship with eighteen men sailed into Seville after leaving. They were all that remained of Magellan's expedition  . 
 Question:The number of the ships lost on the whole expedition was   _  . 
A. two 
B. three 
C. four 
D. five 
 Answer: C
Context: I will never forget the tenth summer of childhood with my grandfather in western Norway at the mountain farm where my mother was born. As a boy ,I always thought people simply bought whatever they need. Whether Grandfather knew this, I don't know. One day he said, ""Come, I have something for you.""
I followed him to a workroom. ""You should have a toy boat. You can sail it at Storvassdal."" He said. Great, I thought,looking around for the boat. But there was none.
Grandfather pointed to a block of wood. ""The boat is in there,"" he said. Then he handed me some tools and showed me how to use them properly. ""It'll be a fine boat,and you'll make it with your own hands,"" he said,""No one can give you what you do for yourself."" The words rang in my head as I worked. Finished the boat. It wasn't much to look at ,but I was poud. Then I sailed it at Storvassdal.
We had to return to America. ""You cannot bring that boat home with you,"" my mother said. We already had too much baggage. Feeling sad, I hid my boat under a big rock at Storvassdal.
I said good-bye to Grandfather, not knowing I would never see him again.
In 1964, I went to Storvassdal with my parents and my wife and children. To my surprise,for 34 years my treasure stayed here,waiting for my return. I felt _ were togethet again although my grandfather had died 22 years before.
I carved""1930""and""1964"" on its side and put it back.
I returned to the lake in 1968,1971,1977 and 1988. Each time I had the boat and carved the year,my grandfather seemed near.
My last trip to Storvassdal was in 1991. I brought my granddaughters: Catherine,13; Claire,12. I hoped they would understand the importance of the little boat and its simple message. At Storvassdal, Claire said softly, 'Grandpa,someday I'll come back.' She added,""And I'll bring my children."" 
 Question:What lesson did the writer's grandfather probably teach him? 
A. Boys should have a toy boat at childhood. 
B. People can simply buy whatever they need. 
C. Boys should learn to make a boat out of wood. 
D. No one can give you what you do for yourself.

Context: Dear Mr. Smith,
I am seeking an opportunity to work with World Destiny as a Computer Systems Manager. My professional experience and my awareness of your high reputation and great achievements have led me to want to work for World Destiny.
Since 1998 I have focused on computer-system design and training. As Systems Administrator for Newport Museum for the past two years, I have directed accounting, capital campaign and publication production. We designed the system from scratch, developing all applications, policies, procedures, and training programs. I was well prepared for such a challenge by my previous positions as a Systems Support Specialist and MicroComputer Assistant for the Imperial Corporation of America.
Over the years, I have worked with Novell, using programs including dBase, Wordstar and Microsoft Word. This familiarity with a variety of hardware and software has helped me to get up to speed on nearly any computer with a minimum training period.
Additional experience in other fields also adds my value to World Destiny. As a Market Research Coordinator for Cushman & Wakefield of California, I not only researched and maintained  a comprehensive database of Silicon Valley, but also produced statistical and written reports that support Cushman & Wakefield's reputation. Previously, I organized companywide annual sales meetings for Qualogy, Inc.
Mr. Smith, while this experience more than qualifies me to join any number of successful companies, it is my personal goals that lead to my interest in being part of the World Destiny team. I believe my computer, promotional, and organizational skills, fueled by my beliefs, make World Destiny and me right for each other. Can we arrange an interview at your earliest convenience? I will call within the next week to arrange a meeting.
Sincerely, Beth Henning

Context: According to the Small Business Association, more than 50 percent of all small businesses fail within the first five years. This is not the case for Apiary Fund CEO, Shawn Lucas. Shawn has grown a very successful business focusing on teaching people how to trade foreign currencies. The Apiary Fund not only gives their traders some of the best Forex   education possible but also gives their traders money to trade with. The Apiary Fund had a slow start but has now become a company that recently hit $1 billion in trader volume  . The Apiary Fund's success has come from the great business concept, and work ethic  .
* Business Concept
The Apiary Fund has a very special but effective business concept, which Shawn Lucas discovered many years ago. You are probably wondering, where did this business concept come from? Shawn, while working as a Financial Advisor, received a phone call one day from a man he hadn't ever spoken to before. The man asked Shawn to go with him to China to do an analysis of a Chinese company's trading systems. The company at the time was under investigation for a possible violation   of intellectual property rights. He agreed to go and before he knew it he was on a plane to China.
During the analysis of this Chinese company Shawn noticed the company had a very effective business method. He noticed that the risk manager had created a system that protected the company from rarely posting a losing day. The risk manager made this all possible by putting restrictions on the amount a trader could lose. If one of the traders lost even a small amount the risk manager would then be notified  .
Shawn left China with a business concept that would later consume much of his life. After returning home, Shawn was devoted to creating a similar risk management system as the Chinese company had created. That risk management system turned into a successful business called the Apiary Fund.
* Work Ethic
The business concept alone didn't magically make the Apiary Fund into a booming business. The Apiary Fund became successful from hard work and devotion. This hard work and devotion has recently brought the Apiary Fund to hit a trading volume high of $1 billion. Shawn Lucas believes that by the end of this year the Apiary Fund can expect to see double or triple that volume. The company has experienced immense growth by making a few changes to their program structure, which has since increased growth by about five times within the last year.
Successful businesses are hard to start, but with a good business concept and great work ethic anything is possible. Shawn and the Apiary Fund are a great example of both. 
 Question:What does Shawn's business do? 
A. Trading with foreigners. 
B. Lend money to those who need it. 
C. Help people to found their own business. 
D. Teach people how to trade foreign currencies. 
 Answer: D
Context: Why are we addicted to upgrades? According to Donald Norman, American author of the book The Design of Everyday Things, ""planned obsolescence""  is the trick behind the upgrading culture of today's consumer electronics industry.
The New York Times cited Norman last month, saying that electronics manufactures strategically release new upgrades periodically, both for hardware and software, so that customers on every level feel the need to buy the newest version.
""This is an old-time trick- they're not inventing anything new,"" he said.
Thomas Wensma, a Dutch designer, despises the ""planned obsolescence"" of companies, as recently reported by UK-based The Guardian.
Wensma said this is a wasteful system through which companies - many of them producing personal electronics - release shoddy products simply because ""they know that, in six months or a year, they'll put out a new one"".
But the new psychology of consumers is part of this system, as Wensma said to the newspaper: ""We now want something new, something pretty, the next shiny thing.""
 _ 
""It's to the damage of the consumer and the environment,"" as the New York Times quoted Norman. ""But perhaps to the betterment of the stockholder.""
In its most recent fiscal  year, Apple's profit margin was more than 21 percent, reported the Los Angeles Times. At Hewlett-Packard, the world's biggest PC manufacturer, it was only 7 percent.
""Steven Jobs pushed the principle of 'planned obsolescence' to new heights,"" the newspaper commented on the company's profits and marketing strategy. ""Apple's annual upgrades of its products generate sales of millions of units as owners of one year's MacBook or iPhone line up to buy the newest version, even when the changes are incremental.""
Peer pressure
As to Li Jijia, the need for upgrading his smart phone comes mainly from friends and classmates. When the majority of friends are switching to the latest devices, he worries about feeling left out.
""Some apps and games require better hardware to run,"" said Li. ""If you don't join in, you lose part of the connection to your friends."" 
 Question:Thomas Wensma's attitude to the ""planned obsolescence"" is   _  . 
A. positive 
B. negative 
C. indifferent 
D. neutral 
 Answer: B

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

Context: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth.
An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, ""the worst came to the worst"". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door.
The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced.
Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank. He says the plant seeds would only be used when all other seeds are gone for some reason. Norwayfirst proposed the idea in the 1980s. But security concerns delayed the plan. At that time, the Soviet Union was meeting inRomeof the Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the above passage? 
A. The government of Norwaywill perform the project alone. 
B. Seeds to be collected there were produced ten thousands years ago. 
C. Spitsbergen is chosen because it is free of the threat unclear war forever. 
D. Temperature is a major consideration when choosing the storage place.

Context: Zambia is a country in southern Africa. More than half of the population is very poor, and companies pay people very little money for their work. One woman named Sylvia Banda had a dream to become a successful businesswoman and build her own brand  . So, after finishing high school, Banda went to college to learn how to start a food company. She studied hard and spent her free time coming up with ways to make money, including making food and selling it to friends.
In 1987, when Banda was 24 years old, she decided to start her own restaurant. She borrowed a room and used food, and pans from her own kitchen. The first day, her restaurant did not have any chairs or tables, but she was able to sell all of the food that she had made. After counting the money, she was surprised that she had made more in one day than most people make in one month.
From that small restaurant, Banda built a large company called the Sylva Group. It now has hundreds of people working for it and is worth over a million dollars. Besides restaurants, the company has now built hotels and a college in Zambia, and it also sells many kinds of packaged   foods. After reaching her goal   of starting her own business and becoming rich, Banda decided to work to improve the lives of other Zambians.
She does this in a number of ways. For one, her restaurants use vegetables and other products   made in Zambia, and by doing so, Banda can support the farmers. Her college also teaches farmers ways to make their farms better, which helps them make more money. The college also helps young Zambians get skills to start their own businesses. Through hard work, Banda has been able to improve both her life and her country.

Context: Once there was an 11-year-old boy who went fishing with his father in the middle of a New Hampshire lake. On the day before bass   season opened, they were fishing early in the evening, catching other fish with worms. Then the boy tied on a small silver lure   and put it into the lake. Suddenly he felt that something very big pulling on the lure. His father watched with admiration as the boy skillfully brought the fish beside the bank. Finally he lifted the tired fish from the water. It was the largest one he had ever seen, but it was a bass.
The boy and his father looked at the big fish. The father lit a match and looked at his watch. It was 10 p.m.--two hours before the season opened. He looked at the fish, then at the boy. ""You'll have to put it back, son,"" he said.
""Dad!"" cried the boy. ""There will be other fish,"" said his father. ""Not as big as this one,"" cried the boy. He looked around the lake. No other fishermen or boats were in sight in the moonlight. He looked again at his father.
Even though no one had seen them, nor could anyone ever know what time he had caught the fish, the boy could tell from his father's voice that the decision couldn't be changed. He threw the huge bass into the black water. The big fish disappeared. The boy thought that he would never again see such a big fish.
That was 34 years ago. Today the boy is a successful architect in New York City. He often takes his own son and daughters to fish at the same place.
And he was right. He has never again caught such a large fish as the one he got that night long ago. But he does see that same fish ... again and again ... every time he has an ethical   decision to make. For, as his father had taught him, ethics are simple matters of right and wrong. It is only the practice of ethics that is difficult. 
 Question:From the text we know that the father   _  . 
A. didn't love his son 
B. always disagreed with his son 
C. disliked the huge fish 
D. was firm and stubborn

Context: People diet to look more attractive.Fish diet to avoid being beaten up,thrown out of their social group,and getting eaten as a result.That is the fascinating conclusion of the latest research into fish behavior by a team of Australian scientists.
The research team have discovered that subordinate  fish voluntarily diet to avoid challenging their larger competitors.""In studying gobies we noticed that only the largest two individuals,a male and female,had breeding rights within the group,"" explains Marian Wong.""All other group members are nonbreeding females,each being 5-10% smaller than its next largest competitor.We wanted to find out how they maintain this precise size separation.""
The reason for the size difference was easy to see.Once a subordinate fish grows to within 5-10% of the size of its larger competitor,it causes a fight which usually ends in the smaller goby being driven away from the group.More often than not, _ is then eaten up.
It appeared that the smaller fish were keeping themselves small in order to avoid challenging the boss fish.Whether they did so voluntarily,by restraining how much they ate,was not clear.The research team decided to do an experiment.They tried to fatten up some of the subordinate gobies to see what happened.To their surprise,the gobies simply refused the extra food they were offered,clearly preferring to remain small and avoid fights,over having a feast.
The discovery challenges the traditional scientific view of how boss individuals keep their position in a group.Previously it was thought that large individuals simply used their weight and size to threaten their subordinates and take more of the food for themselves,so keeping their competitors small.
While the habits of gobies may seem a little mysterious,Dr.Wong explains that understanding the relationships between boss and subordinate animals is important to understand how hierarchical societies remain stable.
The research has proved the fact that voluntary dieting is a habit far from exclusive to humans.""As yet,we lack a complete understanding of how widespread the voluntary reduction of food intake is in nature,"" the researchers comment.""Data on human dieting suggests that,while humans generally diet to improve health or increase attractiveness,rarely does it improve long-term health and males regularly prefer females that are fatter than the females' own ideal."" 
 Question:When a goby grows to within 5-10% of the size of its larger competitor,it   _  . 
A. leaves the group itself 
B. has breeding rights 
C. eats its competitor 
D. faces danger

Context: Infiniti, Nissan's luxury brand, continues to show off ideas for the future.
The Q80 Inspiration here in Paris is an excellent piece of work, perhaps a concept elegant enough to make us forget that Infiniti's former Hong Kong-based president, Johan de Nysschen, moved to take over General Motors' Cadillac car brand in July and Infiniti chairman Andy Palmer is the new CEO at Aston Martin, the British luxury car brand.
The Q80, if it becomes reality, will be brought to market by Infiniti's new boss, former BMW (another famous car brand )executive Roland Kruger. He should focus on this, at least until he is head-hunted to another company.
The Q80 Inspiration is a low and sexy four-door fastback, and it is also a showcase for technology - from autonomous driving to eco-friendly power trains. Here in Paris, the Infiniti people say the hybrid drive in this concept suggest exactly where the brand is going in the future.
The company says the Q80 speaks to how Infiniti plans to pull people into more expensive cars - cars that compete with the Porsche Panamera, for instance.
Alfonso Albaisa, Infiniti Executive Design Director, said the car ""delivers feminine elegance and muscular menace in equal measure and strikes big in terms of styling, craftsmanship, choice of materials and attention to detail.""
Most importantly, for luxury cars buyers who are increasingly puzzled by all the technology, the designers focused on making things simple.
""There is a tendency with modern design that every time you add interior features and technology you add complexity,"" said Albaisa, pointing to the concept's easy-to -understand -and -operate infotainment interface.
As for power, the Q80 Inspiration gets 550 horsepower from a twin turbocharged 3.0-litre V-6 combined with a hybrid electric power train. Fuel economy could be as good as 5.5 litres/100 km. 
 Question:In the future Infiniti will pay more attention to   _  . 
A. details 
B. craftsmanship 
C. energy conservation 
D. materials

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees 
 Answer: C
Context: TOKYO-- At first glance, Japanese cellphones are young people's favorites, with elegant design and quick access to the Internet. However, despite years of competition in overseas markets, Japan's cellphone makers have little presence beyond the country's shores.
The only Japanese cellphone maker with any meaningful global share is Sony Ericsson, and that company is a London-based joint venture between a Japanese electronics maker and a Swedish telecommunications firm.
And Sony Ericsson has been hit by big losses. Its market share was just 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009, behind Nokia of Finland, Samsung Electronics and LG of South Korea, and Motorola of Illinois.
This year, Mr Natsuno, who developed a popular wireless Internet service called i-Mode, invited some of the best minds in the field to debate how Japanese cellphones could go global.
""The most amazing thing about Japan is that even the average person out there will have a very advanced phone, ""said Mr Natsuno. Japan has 100 million users of advanced third-generation smart phones, twice the number of the United States, a much larger market. Many Japanese rely on their phones, not a PC, for Internet access.
Indeed, Japanese cellphone makers thought they had positioned themselves to dominate the age of digital data. But they were a little too clever. In the 1990s, they set a standard for the second-generation network that was refused everywhere else. Then Japan quickly adopted a third-generation standard in 2001. However, it made Japanese phones too advanced for most markets.
Several Japanese companies are now considering a push into overseas markets, including NEC. Panasonic, Sharp, Toshiba and Fujitsu are said to be planning similar moves.
""Japanese cellphone makers need to either look overseas, or exit the business"", said Kenshi Tazaki, a managing vice president at the consulting firm Gartner Japan. 
 Question:Which of the following would be the best title for the passage? 
A. Japanese cellphone companies are unsuccessful. 
B. Japan has more cellphone users than the US. 
C. Japanese cellphone industry intends to expand overseas markets. 
D. Going global--a difficult task for Japanese companies.

Context: Does technology pose a threat to the purity of Chinese language?
Many Chinese use instant messenger tools such as MSN or QQ, listen to music on MP3 players and log on the Internet using ADSL--most without knowing the literal Chinese translation of the abbreviations . But they don't have to, as many English letters have become part of the local vocabulary.
A dozen abbreviations including GDP, NBA, IT, MP3, QQ, DVD and CEO are among the 5,000 most-frequently used words in the Chinese media last year, according to a report on the 2006 Language Situation in China.
The report said some parents are so keen on English letters that a couple tried to name their baby ""@"", claiming the character used in email addresses reflects their love for the child. While the ""@""is obviously familiar to Chinese e-mail users, they often use the English word ""at"" to pronounce it ""ai ta"",or ""love him"".
The study collected more than 1 billion language samples from newspapers, magazines, TV, radio and websites. The annual report is jointly compiled by the Ministry of Education and the State Language Commission.
""Nowadays, more and more English abbreviations are being used in Chinese, making them an important part of modern language,"" said Hou Min, a professor at Communication University of China.
""The abbreviations have gained popularity because of the ease of usage,"" Hou said. For example, DNA is much simpler to use than its Chinese version. ""As more Chinese people learn foreign languages, especially English, in recent years, using abbreviations has become a trend among educated people,"" she added.
Some language scholars fear such usage will contaminate the purity of Chinese and cause confusion in communication. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE about the report on the 2006 Language Situation in China? 
A. The report is compiled by the Ministry of Education alone. 
B. The report is compiled every year. 
C. The report is compiled every two years. 
D. The report is based on over 1 billion language samples from websites.

Context: BEIJING -- Rising smartphone star Xiaomi is moving upmarket and taking aim at Apple's iPhone. The Chinese maker known for low-priced phones on Thursday unveiled   a new model that Chairman J un Lei said is comparable to Apple's iPhone 6 but thinner, lighter and much cheaper. The phone starts at 2, 299 yuan ($375), less than half the 5,288 yuan ($ 865) price of an iPhone 6 in China.
Xiaomi, founded in 2010, passed South Korea's SaM:ung Electronics Co. in the second quarter of last year as the best-selling smartphone brand in China by number of phones sold. The company is expanding into India and other developing markets but has yet to announce plans to enter the United States or Europe.
Xiaomi ""is a respected brand that already has an Apple-like following"" in China, said analyst Brian Blair, who tracks mobile device makers at Rosenblatt Securities. Apple is still a relatively small player in China, selling about 45 million iPhones there last year, Blair estimates, but will continue to grow.
""Apple is very much a premium   brand,"" said Blair. ""The company that's more at risk is SaM:ung, which has been losing share in that market.""
Privately held   Xiaomi said last year's sales tripled to 61. 1 million phones and revenue   more than doubled to 74. 3 billion yuan ($12.2 billion). The company, based in Beijing, recently completed a round of fundraising from investors that it said valued Xiaomi at $ 45 billion, making it one of the world's most valuable technology brands.
Xiaomi ran into legal trouble in India in December after a court blocked sales while it hears a complaint by Sweden's LM Ericcson that the Chinese company violated its patents.
In a blog post earlier this month, Lei called the case a ""rite of passage""   for a young company. 
 Question:What's the attitude of Jun Lei towards the case of Xiaomi in India? 
A. Negative. 
B. Satisfied. 
C. Positive. 
D. Doubtful. 
 Answer: C
Context: As Apple tries to maintain its growth and success in China, the world's largest smart-phone market is becoming even more critical. Apple's shares  fell sharply as the company's earnings for the holiday quarter through December disappointed investors.
The sales of the iPhone, which include both the iPhone 5 and older models, came in at the low end of analysts' expectations, while the company's income plan for the second quarter was below analysts' forecasts, though Apple is known to give conservative   forecasts.
Som'6 analysts have said that for Apple to regain its growth, the company.needs a more aggressive strategy for markets, or more specifically for China, where the market for smart phones has been expanding more rapidly than anywhere else. In China, demand is particularly great for inexpensive phones that run on Android  operating system, sold by many Chinese phone makers as well as South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.
But Apple says it's already enjoying strong growth in China. ""We saw big growth in iPhones,""Chief Executive Tim Cook said. He said that the company has been quickly expanding its sales channels in China, including the number of Apple stores. ""This isn't nearly what we need, we're not even close to that, but we're making great progress. "" he said.
In China, a big missing piece for Apple is China Mobile Ltd. , the biggest local telecom carrier that doesn't yet sell the iPhone. Earlier this month, Mr. Cook met China Mobile Chairman Xi Guohua in Beijing and discussed cooperation, stirring hopes that the world's largest mobile carrier may soon start offering the iPhone.
Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is working on a lower-end iPhone that could launch as early as this year. But one possible challenge for Apple in China is that low-pricod Android-based phones are getting better in terms of quality. A report from CLSA in late November showed that many smart-phones sold at about 1,000 yuan ( $160) came with higher-reso-lution screens, better cameras and more powerful processors than phones at that price did a year earlier. 
 Question:What can we learn from the passage? 
A. Apple tends to offer a lower sales forecast. 
B. China Mobile Ltd began to team up with Apple. 
C. Cook is pessimistic about what Apple did in China. 
D. Apple didn't take measures to develop Chinese market.

Context: Eighth-grader Victoria Bills is talking about money with her classmates. She is worried that a company's stock   price could fall. It may be an unusual topic of conversation for a 13-year-old. But at Bills' school in Chicago, US, you hear it all the time.
The Chicago school's 420 students learn about economic . They also get a chance to make money. Each 1stgrade and 5thgrade, students learn the basics of economics and investing .
Then in 6thgrade, they put what they've learned to work. Students join a junior group that manages the $20,000. The group, made up of 12 to 14 students, decides which stocks to buy.
After graduating, students pass on $20,000 to the next 1stgrade class. They keep half of the rest of the money; the other half goes toward improving the school. They can choose to put their money in a college-savings program or take the cash.
In 2007, Bills suggested that her class buy the stock of the Apple computer company. This was just before the iPhone came out. ""We bought stock just at the right time,"" she says. The kids bought Google stock as it reached $400 a share. It is now worth over $500. ""It was a good buy,"" says Myles Gate, 13. He hopes to be a banker one day.

Context: ""We don't necessarily believe that new advertising, which might make consumers feel better about the Coke brand or better about the ads themselves , will actually result in consumers consuming more of the product,"" Morgan Stanley's Bill Pecoriello wrote in a research note the days after the investor   meeting . But Coke is optimistic it can regain its old magic, and is banking on a new slogan: ""Welcome to the Coke side of life.""
BREAK THROUGH HIT? 
With PepsiCo about to surpass  Coke as the beverage king on Wall Street--Pepsi's market capitalization has  _ in recent years to $97.9 billion, putting it less than a billion dollars behind its rival--the heat is on Coke . It's set to launch a new marketing campaign in March, 2006. And having taken a quick look at Coke's investor presentation on Dec. 7 in New York, my sense is that Coke may be moving in the right direction .
Given the continued shift by consumers away from soda--Coke's stronghold --and into alternative beverages like juice, tea, and water, Coke badly needs a breakthrough hit. And given that shift away from soda, some analyists wonder whether even the catchiest new ads will be enough to put the fizz back into Coke.
SAME OLD, UPDATED?
    The new flavors of PowerAde sports drink will probably enable Coke to continue stealing market share from PepsiCo's Gatorade brand. And Coke is getting a little more creative with packaging, including new, aluminum bottles of Coke that will be sold in nightclubs, and an 8.4-ounce ""100 calorie"" version of its flagship Coke that will appeal to women who want fewer calories and will like the fact that the small can will fit in their purse. I doubt whether other new products will be successful, including a new coffee-flavored soda called Coke-Cola Black that I tried. Think carbonated coffee. But I'm not sure if the product, which Coke is pitching as an afternoon pick-me-up for the 35-and-over set, is going to pull people away from their afternoon Frappucino fix. And my opinion is that Vault, an orange-flavored energy drink, will have just as much trouble unseating Mountain Dew among teens as did Coke's last attempt, a product called Surge.
If there is one concern I have about the fresh offerings Coke plans to launch this year, it appears that many of them are simply new brands, not new products. 
 Question:According to the passage, we can know that   _  . 
A. Coke mainly depends on new products recently 
B. Nowadays Coke is comparatively less popular 
C. PepsiCo has taken the place of Coke 
D. Coke has few new brands

Context: Since around the later part of the 1950s, society started to realize that tobacco cigarettes caused health problems. As research progressed along with increasing numbers of people that developed lung cancer, emphysema, and other smoking related illnesses, cigarette smoking has become less accepted and popular. Unfortunately, the nicotine contained in cigarettes is one of the most addictive substances on the planet and makes quitting smoking one of the hardest things to do. In 2003, Chinese pharmacist, Hon Lik invented the electronic cigarette as a safer, and cleaner way to breathe in nicotine after his father, a heavy smoker, passed away from lung cancer attributed to smoking tobacco cigarettes.
Hon Lik applied for his first patent on the electronic cigarette in 2003 and afterwards introduced e-cigs to the Chinese market in the following year through his employer, Golden Dragon Holdings. Golden Dragon Holdings later changed the company's name to ""Ruyan"" in order to better match the company's name(Ruyan means ""almost like smoke"")to the new product. Since the renaming, the Ruyan company has continued e-cigarette development and grown to be one of the largest global e-cig manufactures.
Dr.Sam Han, CEO of Cixi E-CIG Technology, Inc, Ltd. also has a number of e-cig related inventions, including four patents in the United States and two in China that are electronic cigarette and e-liquid technology related. Similar to Hon Lik's father. Dr. Han was a heavy smoker for more than 40 years before beginning to work on electronic cigarette technologies in order to help himself and others make the shift to vapor smoking. Dr.Han continues to market and conduct R&D in e-cig related techonologies to this date.
After the successful deployment of Ruyan and Cixi E-CIG electronic cigarettes in China and Asia, the products started to be sold in significant quantities on the Internet. 
 Question:Since when have Chinese smokers have been able to buy Hon Lik's electronic cigarettes according to the passage? 
A. 2000. 
B. 2003. 
C. 2004. 
D. 2005.

Context: Dear Mr. Smith,
I am seeking an opportunity to work with World Destiny as a Computer Systems Manager. My professional experience and my awareness of your high reputation and great achievements have led me to want to work for World Destiny.
Since 1998 I have focused on computer-system design and training. As Systems Administrator for Newport Museum for the past two years, I have directed accounting, capital campaign and publication production. We designed the system from scratch, developing all applications, policies, procedures, and training programs. I was well prepared for such a challenge by my previous positions as a Systems Support Specialist and MicroComputer Assistant for the Imperial Corporation of America.
Over the years, I have worked with Novell, using programs including dBase, Wordstar and Microsoft Word. This familiarity with a variety of hardware and software has helped me to get up to speed on nearly any computer with a minimum training period.
Additional experience in other fields also adds my value to World Destiny. As a Market Research Coordinator for Cushman & Wakefield of California, I not only researched and maintained  a comprehensive database of Silicon Valley, but also produced statistical and written reports that support Cushman & Wakefield's reputation. Previously, I organized companywide annual sales meetings for Qualogy, Inc.
Mr. Smith, while this experience more than qualifies me to join any number of successful companies, it is my personal goals that lead to my interest in being part of the World Destiny team. I believe my computer, promotional, and organizational skills, fueled by my beliefs, make World Destiny and me right for each other. Can we arrange an interview at your earliest convenience? I will call within the next week to arrange a meeting.
Sincerely, Beth Henning

Context: The Norwegian Government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down (though these have already been raised); and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the Government will be able to hold things back for long. As one Norwegian politician said last week: "" We will soon be changed beyond all recognition.""
Ever since the war, the Government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. During the past few years this program has had a great deal of success. Tromso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern policy could be in ruins.
The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 percent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad.
The real argument over oil is its threat to the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it, because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as essentially Norwegian. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most critical of the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the countryside and to the sea. 
 Question:According to the passage, the oil industry might lead northern Norway to   _  . 
A. the development of industry 
B. a growth in population 
C. the failure of the development program 
D. the development of new towns 
 Answer: C
Context: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth.
An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, ""the worst came to the worst"". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door.
The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced.
Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank. He says the plant seeds would only be used when all other seeds are gone for some reason. Norwayfirst proposed the idea in the 1980s. But security concerns delayed the plan. At that time, the Soviet Union was meeting inRomeof the Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the above passage? 
A. The government of Norwaywill perform the project alone. 
B. Seeds to be collected there were produced ten thousands years ago. 
C. Spitsbergen is chosen because it is free of the threat unclear war forever. 
D. Temperature is a major consideration when choosing the storage place. 
 Answer: D
Context: By 2050, half of the world's population will live in the tropics--the  ly warm belt that circles the globe--according to State of the Tropics, a report released today. Rapid population growth, along with economic growth, means that the region's influence will grow in coming decades, the authors of the 500-page work predict.
The project, first launched in 2011, aimed to answer one significant question: Is life in the tropics improving? To find out, the researchers analyzed environmental, social, and economic indicators collected over 6 decades. It finds that the region has made ""extraordinary progress"" in many areas. For example, more people have access to safe drinking water, and the number of protected areas is increasing. The tropics also have outperformed the rest of the world in economic growth over the past 30 years.
However, some challenges remain. Investment in research and development, for example, has increased cautiously, but tropical nations still invest less than the rest of the world. ""As a proportion of GDP the Rest of the World invests almost four times as much in research and development than the Tropics."" concludes the report.
The report also includes a new analysis of how climate change will affect the region. Many plant and animal species are moving poleward in an attempt to stay within their preferred environmental conditions in the tropics, the authors write. However, some organisms may not be able to keep pace with the changing conditions, they predict. As a result, they can experience population declines or go extinct.
In addition, an expanded tropical zone also threatens health and safety issues, the authors warn. As regions become more suitable to insects such as mosquitoes and ticks, the spread of insect-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, and Lyme disease could rise, causing a burden to human health and the economy. 
Bruna, a researcher, says he sees a lot to be concerned about in the report. ""While we've made incredible advances in some areas, I think the risks for the tropics that are highlighted in this report are things that we really need to be concerned about."" 
 Question:Which of the following best describes the writer's attitude?

Context: When Denis Hennequin took over as the European boss of McDonald's in January 2004, the world's biggest restaurant chain was showing signs of recovery in America and Australia, but sales in Europe were sluggish or declining.One exception was France, where Mr.Hennequin had done a reliable job as head on the group's French subsidiary  to sell more Big Macs to his relatives, His task was to copy this success in all 41 of the European countries where anti-globalisers' favourite enemy operates.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT."" 
 Question:The price of the knives was cut down by half because   _  . 
A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap 
D. the knives were produced in one factory 
 Answer: B
Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption

Context: A brand is a name, word, sign, symbol, design, or a combination of these, intended to identify the goods or services of a company or a group of companies. Another purpose of a brand is to contrast one company from another. The most important skill of professional marketers is the ability to create, maintain, protect, and enhance the brands of their products and services. Branding has become so important that today hardly any company or product is without one. Therefore, brand management is an increasingly important element in marketing.
Brand power refers to the relative strength of a company's brand in the minds of consumers, and can influence consumers' choice of products. Brands are powerful to the extent that they give high brand loyalty and strong brand associations, name recognition, perceived quality and other assets to a company. A strong brand can be one of a company's most important assets.
High brand power provides a company with many competitive advantages. A powerful brand enjoys a high level of consumer brand awareness and loyalty. Because consumers expect stores to carry the brand, the company has more bargaining power when negotiating with retailers  . And because the brand name brings high credibility, a company with a strong brand can more easily launch new products with the same brand name.
Many companies use the advantage of a strong brand power strategically to expand their business. When a company introduces an additional item with a new flavour, form, colour or package size in a given product category and under the same brand name, it is called a line extension. Another strategy is called brand extension. This involves the use of a successful brand name to launch new or modified products in a new category, thereby employing brand recognition in order to increase sales of new products.
Brand recognition is certainly important. Because consumers often hold long-standing perceptions about brands, high brand power ensure a company continued sales of its products. 
 Question:What might be the best title of this passage? 
A. Brand Power 
B. Famous Brands 
C. Company Brands 
D. Brand Products

Context: On hearing the words ""Just do it!"", you will know there is a Nike product nearby. If it's ""Always Coca-Cola"", you can be sure someone wants to sell you a refreshing drink.

Context: When you buy a T-shirt, or a fur coat in a store, it often carries a label telling who made it or from what store it was bought. Instead, some labels show the dress is famous and it is very expensive, so buyers secretly wish they could be carried forever. On the other hand, buyers who deal with the cheapest products would be pleased to be away with labels  _ .
However, there is another label more important than the one showing from which store the dress was bought. When a person buys a fur coat, or a jacket from a store, a label telling what the product is made of should be carried to it.
The label is required by law. Besides telling what the product on show is made of, the label should be in clear English and be where one can find it easily. The information on the label must be true.
The reason for this is that most buyers today aren't expert enough to know exactly what kind of fur or material they are buying. The buyers must believe in the store that sells the products or in what the label says. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE? 
A. A T-shirt seldom carries a label. 
B. A fur coat with a high price often carries a false label. 
C. A label only says what material the product is made of. 
D. Not all buyers know the materials they are buying.

Context: Millions of British people have _ the traditional ""thank you"" and took the place of it with the less formal ""cheers"", according to a survey.
Although the common person will say ""thank you"" nearly 5,000 times a year, one in three are more likely to add a ""cheers"" or ""ta"" where it's needed to show they are fashionable.
One in twenty now say ""nice one"" instead, while the younger are more likely to offer a ""cool"" than a ""thank you"". ""Merci"", ""fab"" and even ""gracias"" were also listed as common phrases to use, as ""much appreciated "".
One in twenty who took part in the survey of 2,000 people by the Food Network UK for Thank You Day, which is marked on November 24, 2011, said a formal ""thank you"" was now not often needed in everyday conversation. More than one in ten adults said they regularly won't say thank you if they are in a bad mood. Most people stated that saying thank you was something that their parents trained them. A huge 70 percent of those questioned will say thank you to a person's face without even meaning it, while one fifth avoid saying it when they know they should.
It seems our friends and family get the stress of our bad manners. Half of them admit   they're not good at thanking those closest to them. Many of them explain that they don't say thank you because their family ""already know I'm grateful"".
When spoken words won't do, it falls to a nice text to do the job for most people.
One third will still send a handwritten thank-you note---but 45 percent admit it's been more than six months since they tried to send one.
A quarter of British people say ""thank you"" with food, with 23 percent cooking a meal to show their appreciation to someone. Another 15 percent bake a cake.
It follows that 85 percent of people will be angry because of not getting the gratitude  they feel they should receive. 
 Question:Most of the people who took part in the survey say that they say ""thank you""   _  . 
A. when they are in good mood 
B. completely out of habit 
C. when they feel truly grateful 
D. purely out of politeness

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

Context: Future historians will be in a particular position when they come to record the history of our own times. They will hardly know which facts to select from the great mass of evidence that's always increasing. What is more, they will not have to rely only oh the written word. Films, videos, CDs and CD-ROMs are just some of the huge amount of information they will have. They will be able, as it were, to see and hear us in action. But the historian attempting to show the distant past again is always faced with a difficult task. He has to make proper use of evidence available to draw reasonable conclusions. Good news is that even evidence that may appear unimportant can shed light on the history of early man.
Up to now, historians have assumed that calendars came into being with the appearance of agriculture, for man of that time was faced with a real need to understand something about the seasons. Recent scientific evidence seems to suggest that this assumption is incorrect
Historians have long been puzzled by dots, lines and symbols which have been carved on walls, bones and so on. The nomads   who made these markings lived by hunting and fishing during the last Ice Age which began about 35,000 B.C. and ended about 10,000 B.C. By comparing and analyzing markings made in various parts of the world, historians have been able to read this difficult ""language"". They have found that it is connected with the passing of days and the stages of the moon. It is, in fact, a primitive type of calendar. It has long been known that the hunting scenes drawn on walls were not simply a form of expression of art. They had a certain meaning, for they were as near as early man could get to writing. It is possible that there is a certain relation between these, paintings and the markings that sometimes accompany them. It seems that man was making a real effort to understand the seasons 20,000 years earlier than has been supposed. 
 Question:What can we infer from this passage? 
A. Agriculture existed thanks to calendars. 
B. Calendars appeared thanks to Agriculture. 
C. Agriculture started long before calendars appeared 
D. Calendars appeared long before agriculture started

Context: If sustainable competitive advantage depends on workforce skills, American firms have a problem. Human-resource management is not traditionally seen as central to the competitive survival of the firm in the United States. Skill acquisition is considered an individual responsibility. Labour is simply another factor of production to be hired--rented at the lowest possible cost--much as one buys materials or equipment.
The lack of importance attached to human-resource management can be seen in the corporate management. In an American firm the chief financial officer is almost always second in command. The post of head of human-resource management is usually a specialized job, off at the edge of the corporate hierarchy. The executive who holds it is never consulted on major strategic decisions and has no chance to move up to Chief Executive Officer(CEO). By way of contrast, in Japan the head of human-resource management is central--usually the second most important executive, after the CEO, in the firm's hierarchy.
While American firms often talk about the vast amounts spent on training their work force, in fact they invest less in the skills of their employees than do either Japanese or German firms. The money they do invest is also more highly concentrated on professional and managerial employees. And the limited investments that are made in training workers are also much more narrowly focused on the specific skills necessary to do the next job rather than on the basic background skills that make it possible to absorb new technologies.
As a result, problems arise when new breakthrough technologies arrive. If American workers, for example, take much longer to learn how to operate new flexible manufacturing stations than workers on Germany (as they do), the effective cost of those stations is lower in Germany than it is in the United States. More time is required before equipment is up and running in production, and the need for extensive retraining generates costs and creates bottlenecks that limit the speed with which new equipment can be used. The result is a slower pace of technological change, and in the end the skills of the bottom half of the population affect the wages of the top half. If the bottom half can't effectively make the processes that have to be operated, the management and professional jobs that go with these processes will disappear. 
 Question:Which of the following applies to the management of human resources in American companies? 
A. They hire people at the lowest cost with  ly best skills. 
B. They see the gaining of skills as their employees' own business. 
C. They attach more importance to workers than to equipment. 
D. They only hire skilled workers because of keen competition.

Context: In its latest step to attract Chinese smartphone users, e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. said it is planning to launch a mobile gaming service soon. 
Alibaba is considering integrating  its new mobile gaming service into its messaging app, Laiwang, as well as its Mobile Taobao app for online shopping, a person familiar with the matter said. It is also planning to launch the gaming service as a standalone app, the person said. 
In the world of gaming and other mobile-based services, Alibaba faces powerful competitor Tencent Holdings Ltd., a giant in online gaming and social networking services. Many analysts view Tencent as a leader in mobile-based businesses in China because of its popular WeChat instant-messaging app, which has over 272 million monthly active users worldwide according to the company. Tencent could use WeChat's massive user base to offer additional mobile services such as gaming or e-commerce, analysts say. 
Alibaba's push into mobile-based services hasn't always been smooth. It launched Laiwang more than a year ago, but the app, which competes against WeChat, struggled to gain popularity. In September, a person familiar with the situation said Alibaba was in talks with China Telecom Corp., to have the app preinstalled in smartphones sold by the country's third-largest mobile carrier. According to Alibaba, Laiwang had more than 10 million registered users as of November. 
Alibaba dominates China's e-commerce market with its Taobao and Tmall shopping sites, but one of the biggest challenges it faces is how to hold onto its vast user base when more Chinese Internet users access online services from smartphones. To meet this challenge, Alibaba has made several acquisitions to strengthen its mobile-based services. Last year, it took an 18% stake  in Sina Corp.'s Twitter-like Weibo service and integrated some of Taobao's e-commerce services with the microblog. It also bought a 28% stake in mobile mapping firm AutoNavi Holdings Ltd., a move that could enable Alibaba to send location-based ads to smartphone users.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture

Context: In 1992, I had just launched a new business called Video News International.
It was the world's first video journalist network. The idea was to cover news and sell the service to news organizations.
One day, a young intern   who was working for us named Anthony Lappe pulled me aside.
""There is something you have to see,"" he told me. ""Comcast is doing this really cool thing.""
""What?""
""The Internet,"" he said. ""It's going to be really big.""
Anthony later introduced me to the head of the Internet project.
""We are looking for content to put on our network here,"" the guy said to me.
Well, I said I had lots of content to offer.
The guy's eyes lit up. ""Cool,"" he said. ""We would like to put it on our network.""
Well, I was always looking for new clients.
""What are you going to pay?"" I asked.
He said that they could not pay anything for the content, but they would set up a URL for me.
""What's that?"" I asked.
""It's kind of like your address on the web.""
""What would I do with this URL thing?""
""Well, it could be your business.""
""I don't see how it is a business, and there's not even any advertising,"" I cleverly replied.
""Not yet,"" he said. ""But one day there might be.""
I thought about it for two seconds.
""Naah..."" I said. "" _ . I've got to be going now. Maybe we can cooperate next time.""
And I walked out.
Idiot!
Well, that Internet thing turned out to be so much bigger than I had thought. I wish I had never made such a mistake. Sorry Anthony. You were right.

 Answer: C
Context: On March 28th, the New York Times will begin charging all but the most infrequent users to read articles online.
In a letter to readers, Arthur Sulzberger, Jr., the publisher of the paper, laid out the details of the paywall, which he said will go into effect immediately in Canada and on March 28th for the rest of the world. He called the move ""an important step that we hope you will see as an investment in the Times, one that will strengthen our ability to provide high-quality journalism to readers around the world and on any platform.""
Sulzberger said that readers will be able to read 20 articles per month at no charge. Once they click on the 21st piece, however, they'll be presented with three payment options: $ 15 for four weeks of online and mobile application access, $ 20 for access to the site and the iPad application, or $ 35 for access to everything. People who already receive the printed paper through home delivery will enjoy free and unlimited access to the Times on all platforms.
These details largely agree with earlier reports on how the paywall would work. The Times had made it clear that it did not want to imitate the total paywalls put into effect by papers such as The Times of London and Newsday, which block access to all contents unless the reader pays.
The paper also signaled that it wants to stay relevant in the social media world. According to Sulzberger's announcement, people who come to the Times site from Facebook, Twitter or from blogs will be able to read those articles even if they have gone over their monthly limit.
However, Sulzberger said that a limit will be placed on ""some search engines"", meaning that after readers have accessed a certain number of articles from search engines, any further articles they access from there will be added to their monthly count. It was reported that the only search engine that will be affected this way is Google, where there will be a five-article limit. This marks a clear attempt by the Times to close what could be a giant loophole  , since so much online traffic is directed through Google. But it also presents a risk for the Times for the same reason.
Sulzberger seems well aware of the risk. ""The challenge now is to put a price on our work without walling ourselves off from the global network,"" he said, adding that the Times must ""continue to engage with the widest possible audience."" 
 Question:What challenge may the paywall bring to the New York Times? 
A. It may bring the Times more competition with the other media 
B. It may stop the Times connecting to the global network 
C. It may block the readers from the other websites 
D. It may result in huge drops in papers' online readership

Context: Twenty courses provided by 18 top Chinese universities went online on Wednesday, China's latest attempt to disseminate teaching resources within the nation and promote Chinese culture globally.
These courses cover 20 subjects or lectures given by speakers and professors from several universities, including Zhejiang University, Nankai University and Wuhan University.Most of the courses will focus on traditional Chinese culture, according to the Ministry of Education. They are available through the websites of NetEase and China Network Television, as well as icourse.edu.cn, for free.
Some of the courses will be translated into English and promoted across the rest of the world, according to NetEase Company, an international body promoting open content among the world's universities.
The company has set up a translation team and ""will kick off the translation work when we finish the negotiation on intellectual rights with universities"", said Zhu Xirui, a senior manager for NetEase Company.
         ""We want to promote Chinese culture to overseas netizens through the program,"" he said.
Ding Xiuhong, another manager of NetEase Company, said they had invested more than 15 million yuan($2.37 million)in the program.
""Although we haven't made a profit from 'the program, it will at least help increase our website's page views,"" Ding said.
""I'd like to watch the Chinese elite  classes, such as Chinese literature and poetry, as well as economy,"" said Jeremy Scaramuzzi, a teacher at Tsinghua International School.
He said he was also interested in Chinese classes on political science since that is the subject he majored in in the United States.

Context: Ron Meyer is the president and COO  of Universal Studios.As one of the most successful business leaders in Hollywood, he heads up Universal Pictures and Universal Parks & Resorts.He's the guy who oversees the production of Multimillion-dollar extravaganzas  likeKing KongandCinderella Man.
Meyer's story sounds like the plot of one of his motion pictures.He grew up in a modest home where there was little income.It was a big deal to go to a restaurant.At 15, he quit high school and spent his time hanging out with the neighborhood toughs .He was then a kid quick with his fists who seemed to get into fights somewhat regularly.At one point, he was separated from others with an infectious disease, having no TV and nothing to do.His mother sent him two books.One wasThe Amboy Dukes, a novel about kids in street gangs.The other wasThe Flesh Peddlers, about a guy in the talent agency who lived a successful life.""I realized,"" he says, ""that I was no longer that silly kid I had been, and I wanted to change my life.""
Meyer took any job he could get.He worked as a busboy and short-order cook.He cleaned offices and sold shoes.That attitude made an impression on people.One day he received a call from Paul Kohner, a successful agent who represented stars like John Huston, Charles Bronson and Lana Turner.Their messenger and driver had quit, and they knew Ron was willing to take whatever job they offered. He started the job the next day.
Meyer was lucky to work with a good boss--and _ .In nearly six years of driving for Kohner, Meyer became his right-hand man and learned a lot.By the 1970s, Meyer had built many relationships in the business.In 1975, the fate presented an opportunity and he started his own operation Creative Artists Agency, which became a huge success, representing Hollywood legends like Barbra Streisand, Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise.
Twenty years later, Meyer was appointed to run Universal Studios, a position far beyond his youthful dream.But once he saw success was possible, he was driven to achieve it.Today, colleagues regularly owe his success--and theirs--to his humility and perseverance.It's a level of success that takes determination, personality and intelligence, whether it comes from a college education or from the street. 
 Question:What is the main idea of the passage? 
A. How a bitter childhood contributes to one's success. 
B. It's important to choose a right career to achieve one's life goal. 
C. A talent agency helps a person to become famous. 
D. It's people's determination, intelligence and personality that decide their success.

Context: It doesn't look like the heart of a green revolution. The huge chimneys stick up above the line of pine trees and don't make for the most scenic view as you wander around the clear blue waters of the nearby lake.
But it is this power plant that has helped the small Swedish city of Vaxjo become arguably the greenest place in Europe. On closer observation, the only thing emerging from the chimneys is the faintest mists of steam. And inside it smells more like a sauna  than a furnace . That's because it is not oil fuelling the plant, but woodchip and other wood waste from the area's sawmills. And as well as generating electricity, it also supplies 90 per cent of this southern Swedish town with heating and hot water.[:Zxxk.Com]
The gases produced as the wood burns are changed into liquid form, and are purified before they reach the chimney. And instead of wasting this liquid, the power plant pumps it around town. Some runs out of the town's public taps; the rest is directed through pipes that run through individual heaters, warming homes and offices.
The pile of wood chippings in the yard towers above head height and takes almost five minutes to walk around. That's enough to keep Vaxjo warm on the snowiest day in winter, or supply it with hot water for a fortnight in summer, and it's good way of using the paper industry's waste. As well as the centuries-- old Swedish policy of planting a new tree for every one felled, the ashes swept out of the furnace each day find their way back to the forest as fertilizer .
It was this green plant that netted Vaxjo the European Union's award for sustainable development, making it the greenest city on the continent.
However, it is not just the citizen's consciences and moral histories to which the town's current day authorities are appealing. They know how to talk to their wallets too. Oil-generated electricity costs about 16,000 kronor a year(PS1,170) per person, while the new power plant's electricity comes in at two thirds of the price.
They've been planning for over ten years to become a ""Fossil Fuel Free City"". But according to Anders Franzen, the head of planning and development department at the city council: ""The battle in the energy sector has been won, yes, but the next battleground is transport."" 
 Question:What impresses the town's current-- day authorities most? 
A. The citizens' consciences. 
B. The town's moral histories. 
C. The lower cost of electricity 
D. The award for sustainable development 
 Answer: C
Context: Does your local town have a nickname? If so, what does it say about the area and the people who live there? Many cities are recognized across the world by  their unofficial names. New York is the Big Apple, London is the Big Smoke, and Los Angeles is famously called La La Land.
Now, as part of English Language Day on Wednesd ay, two British organizations, the English Project and Ordnance Survey, are launching    an interactive project which aims to identify the nicknames which people use in their daily lives for the places which they like or dislike.
""The name that people create for a place forms a connection with feelings,"" explains Winchester University's Professor Bill Lucas, a patron   of the English Project.
""So Basingstoke becomes Amazingstoke; Swindon is known as Swindump and Padstow, hometown of chef Rick Stein, is nicknamed Padstein.""
Basingstoke is a town in central England. The local nickname, Amazingstoke, shows the love that locals seem to have for the area. Swindon, on the other hand, is sometimes called Swindump, showing that some people think it's a dump ( ). Stanford Le Hope in Essex is  called Stanford No Hope by locals.
And Padstow in Cornwall is so closely connected with the local famous person Rick Stein that it's become known as Padstein.
Since launching the online survey last week, the creators have already received 3,000 alternative titles for places and landmarks.
As well as creating what promises to be a fascinating resource of nicknames, there is a practical side to the project. ""With the huge variety of place nicknames that exist, we could never hope to collect them all ourselves,"" says Glen Hart, Ordnance Survey's head of research. ""But the information from the project could prove vital. Organizations like the emergency services rely on our information when responding to 999 calls, so by having the most complete set of nicknames we could help the emergency services quickly locate the right place, and maybe even save lives."" 
 Question:What is the passage mainly about? 
A. Some stories about nicknames for places. 
B. Activities launched by two British organizations. 
C. A survey of nicknames for places. 
D. The attractiveness of place nicknames.

Context: In 2007.five young people in the American state of Massachusetts developed an idea. The team knew that the world is filled with mobile phones.About eighty percent of all people are said to live within reach of a wireless telephone signal.    
    The idea was to use mobile phones and the Internet to connect job seekers with employers.The young people wrote a business plan and formed a company called Assured Labor.

    After a job is completed,the employer and employee rate each other, The rating is kept for  future use.Assured Labor is not charging anyone,right now, but the plan is to have employers pay for the service.

He called all of the young people in the kingdom together one day. He said, ""It is time for me to choose the next emperor. I have decided to choose one of you.""
The kids were shocked! But the emperor continued, ""I am going to give each one of you a seed today. One special seed. I want you to plant it and come back one year later with what you have grown from this seed. I will then judge the plants, and the one I choose will be the next emperor!""
One boy named Ling received a seed like the others. He went home and planted the seed in a pot, watering it carefully. Every day he would water it and watch to see if it had grown. After about three weeks, some of the other youths began to talk about their plants that were beginning to grow. Ling kept checking his seed, but nothing ever grew.
A year finally went by and all the youths brought their plants to the emperor. Ling thought he should be honest about what had happened. So he took his empty pot to the palace. When Ling arrived, he was amazed at the plants grown by other youths. They were beautiful, in all shapes and sizes.
When the emperor arrived, he surveyed the room and greeted the young people. Ling just tried to hide in the back. Suddenly, the emperor spotted Ling at the back of the room with his empty pot. He ordered his guards to bring him to the front. Ling was terrified. When Ling got to the front, the Emperor asked his name. ""My name is Ling,"" he replied. All the kids were laughing and making fun of him. The emperor asked everyone to quiet down. He looked at Ling, and then announced to the crowd, ""Behold your new emperor! His name is Ling!"" Then the emperor said, ""One year ago today, I gave you all boiled seeds which would not grow."" 
 Question:Whom will the emperor consider to choose from as his successor in his country? 
A. His children. 
B. All of his relatives. 
C. All the young people. 
D. The bravest fighters. 
 Answer: C
Context: Tobacco companies are fighting efforts in the United States and Australia to make their products less appealing. In Washington, a federal judge last week blocked the Food and Drug Administration from requiring new warning labels on cigarette packs. Judge Richard Leon ruled in a case brought by five tobacco companies. The judge temporarily stopped a new federal rule which requires large new warnings starting next September. These include color1 images such as a dead body or diseased lungs. And simple text warnings now appear.
Congress called for color1 images showing the dangers of smoking, similar to what Canada does. But the tobacco companies say the new requirements approved in June violate   their free speech rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Judge Leon said the FDA could not require the new labels before a lawsuit  against the government is decided. Some experts say the process could take years. The judge said he believed the cigarette makers were highly likely to win their case.
He said the images should be designed to appeal to emotions, rejecting government arguments that they should be purely factual. He accused the government of trying to use the labels to promote an ""obvious anti-smoking agenda?""
The head of an anti-smoking group, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the decision ""wrong on the science and wrong on the law"".
About one-fifth of American adults smoke. The World Health Organization says tobacco kills nearly six mil-lion people worldwide each year. More than six hundred thousand of them are non-smokers who breathe other people's tobacco smoke.
In Australia, tobacco companies want to stop what would be the world's most restrictive laws on cigarette advertising. Cigarettes could be sold only in plain olive-green packages. Only the brand name and health warnings could appear. The Senate passed the bill last week and sent it back to the Lower House to approve minor amendments  . The law is to go into effect in December of next year.
Tobacco companies Say the legislation   violates the Australian constitution. They say it would unjustly reduce the value of their brand names and trademarks. Health Minister Nicola Roxon says the government is ready for a legal fight. 
 Question:What are the tobacco companies ii1 the United States and Australia fighting against? 
A. The requirements to sell fewer products to the public. 
B. The requirements to print new warning labels on their products. 
C. The measures to make their products more attractive. 
D. The ways to make the companies close their business.

Context: When Regis Mngwiro and the other villagers moved to a new place in southeastern Zimbabwe, Africa, they were happy to find a lake nearby. Now, they would no longer have to walk long distances looking for water. At last, they had a source   of water what they call their own.
But several days later, two young boys saw something they had never seen before--a huge animal was standing at the edge of the lake, eating grass. When the animal saw the boys, it walked into the lake and disappeared   beneath the water.
Regis looked into the story of the big creature that vanished into to the lake. ""When I took a closer look at the dung  , I realized that it was from a hippo  ,"" he said.
Twelve hippos were living in the lake. The villagers were worried. In the countrry of Zimbabwe, hippos attack humans more often than lions do. The hippos would often stay on the village side of the lake all day. This meant that the villagers could not go near the lake until the hippos got out. It was too long a wait for the villagers, because they needed the water from the lake to survive  . ""This is the only source of fresh water in the village,"" said a villager. ""There is no way we can avoid this lake."" So the women began moving in groups whenever they went to get water from the lake. Before collecting water, they made sure no hippos were nearby. The men began fishing in pairs, with one man always looking out for hippos.
It took time, but these days, the hippos and humans live side by side. The villagers say that when the hippos find people coming, they swim slowly to the other side of the lake and mind their own business. The villagers do not go into the part of the lake where the hippos usually stay. They have learned to share the lake they both need to survive. 
 Question:When the villagers found the hippos, they   _  . 
A. wanted to kill them 
B. stopped collecting water from the lake 
C. tried to drive them away 
D. became careful when they went near the lake

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees 
 Answer: C
Context: When you buy a T-shirt, or a fur coat in a store, it often carries a label telling who made it or from what store it was bought. Instead, some labels show the dress is famous and it is very expensive, so buyers secretly wish they could be carried forever. On the other hand, buyers who deal with the cheapest products would be pleased to be away with labels  _ .
However, there is another label more important than the one showing from which store the dress was bought. When a person buys a fur coat, or a jacket from a store, a label telling what the product is made of should be carried to it.
The label is required by law. Besides telling what the product on show is made of, the label should be in clear English and be where one can find it easily. The information on the label must be true.
The reason for this is that most buyers today aren't expert enough to know exactly what kind of fur or material they are buying. The buyers must believe in the store that sells the products or in what the label says. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE? 
A. A T-shirt seldom carries a label. 
B. A fur coat with a high price often carries a false label. 
C. A label only says what material the product is made of. 
D. Not all buyers know the materials they are buying.

Context: There are many types of reports.A report is simply an account of something that has happened.The commonest are news reports.We get them in newspapers,over radio and on television.Sometimes cinemas also show us newsreels.

Context: Doubt usually comes along when companies talk very proudly how socially responsible they are, but Nike's decision to publish its entire list of contract suppliers on the Internet is harder to ignore. Nike's move opens a new front in companies' efforts to face their critics.
As Nike states in its latest corporate responsibility report, it is often hard to confirm exactly what is happening at about 800 factories that make its footwear and clothing under contract, many of which are remote.
Nike is hoping other companies will publish their factory lists, too. Hannah Jones, Nike's vice - president for corporate responsibility, says Nike would like to see the best - run contract factories using their social position as suppliers to the big brands to try to get more work.
Nike's approach moves corporate responsibility into its third age. The first age was corporate philanthropy - companies donating money to various community projects. The $170,   000,000 that Wal - Mart gave in charitable donations last year is a good example. Of course, some critics oppose even this form of corporate generosity , arguing that companies should concentrate on making profits, leaving it to shareholders to decide what charitable donations to make.
Corporate responsibility's second age was reputation management and risk avoidance. Second - age corporate responsibility supporters believe agreement with the wider community can warn a company of future risks in advance.
Nike is now trying to go a stage further. The company says it sees corporate responsibility as a way of improving its performance rather than just protecting its reputation. Factories which ensure that workers are registered  for social - security benefits often become more productive as a result. Attention to one aspect of staff management often leads to improvement in others.
If other companies publish supplier lists, they can together work out common standards, Nike says. At present, different companies have different standards, which make life difficult for the many factories that produce for more than one brand. If other companies published suppliers' locations, they could work out common standards and save money by relying on one another's checks. 
 Question:What effect could Nike's action have on its contract suppliers? 
A. Their managers will win promotion they desire. 
B. They will get donations from big brands easily. 
C. There's no need for their factories to be checked. 
D. They may have more opportunities to make money.

Context: Experts estimate that one out of every five fish sold was caught illegally. It threatens  food security and hurts the environment. Officials are using new observational technology to fight illegal fishing.
""Thank you for taking the time to join us here in Harwell (UK) in the Operations Center to what we call 'Project Eyes on the Seas.'"" says Tony Long, who leads the Ending Illegal Fishing program for Pew Charitable Trusts. The group created Project Eyes on the Seas. Large three-dimensional images of a globe can be seen on a video.
""It looks different from what you might expect because this globe only shows you the boats that are coming into this system from a live automated information system or AIS.""
The screen shows 120,000 fishing boats have AIS. They are required to have the technology. But those who are fishing illegally often turn it off. The technology does not tell observers when that happens. Project Eyes on the Seas combines satellite information with secret government records on every ship's past activities.
Mr. Long says that permits researchers to understand exactly where the fishing boats are operating. The Pew team gives the information it gathers to port officials to help them decide if they should take action against a ship. Tony Long says he would like to be able to provide port officials all over the world with clear lists. They would inform the officials about ships to inspect, ships to bar from entrance, and ships to permit entrance for trade activities.
The Pacific island nation of Palau was an early user of the technology. Palau has one of the richest fishing areas in the world. Last year, it announced a plan to ban commercial fishing in a 630,000 square kilometer area. K.B. Sakuma is a special adviser to the president of Palau. He says Palau is trying to deal with a recent increase in illegal, unsupervised and unreported fishing.
""And it's come to a head in the last year or two. From our southern island in the evening you can see on the horizon just dotted lights of these illegal fishermen that come into our waters, fill their ships with our fish, our resources, our food security..."" 
 Question:According to the estimation, what is the percentage of illegal fishing? 
A. 1% 
B. 5% 
C. 23.5% 
D. 20%

Context: Scientists will put some robot fish into the sea near Spain this year. These robot fish will help people find out the pollution in the water. If the robot fish are able to finish their work successfully, the team of scientists hopes the fish will be used in rivers, lakes and seas around the world.
The robot fish are about 1.5 meters long. There is a detector  in their bodies. It can find the pollution in the water, and then the robot fish will eat part of it.
They can ""swim"" for eight hours in the sea freely and send back information to people on the beach. After their energy runs down, they will go back to the beach by themselves.
There are five robot fish altogether. Each costs about 29,000 dollars. They are part of a three-year project between engineering company BMT Group and Essex University in southeastern England.

Context: People in cities all over the world shop in supermarkets. When you enter the supermarket, you see shelves full of food. You walk in the aisles, pushing your shopping cart. You probably hear soft, slow music in the supermarket. This kind of music is playing to relax you and make you walk slowly. Thus, you will probably stay longer and buy more food.
Where do you go in the supermarket when you first arrive? Many people go to the meat section first. This area of the store has many different kinds of meat. Some kinds are expensive and others are not. Usually, some kinds of meat are on sale. So it has a special low price. The manager of the store knows where the customers usually enter the meat section. The meat on sale is usually at the other end of the section, away from where the customers enter. If you want to buy this specially priced meat, you have to walk by the more expensive meat first. Maybe you will see something that you want to buy before you reach the cheaper, inexpensive meat. Then you will spend more money in the meat section.
The diary section sells milk that is low in fat. Some supermarkets sell three different containers of low-fat milk. Each container looks different, but each contains the same product. One says ""1% fat"", one says ""99% fat free"" and one says ""low-fat"" in big letters and ""1%""in very small letters. If you look carefully you can see that all the milk has the same amount of fat, and each container is the same size. The prices of all these three should be the same. However, in many stores these three containers of milk would each have a different price. The store will make more money if a customer chooses the milk that costs the most.
Most of the food in supermarkets is very attractive. People often stop to look at the products in attractive containers. But remember, many products will say, ""Buy me!"". Stop and think which ones are the best value for your money. 
 Question:The three different kinds of low-fat milk   _   . 
A. contain three different amount of milk 
B. contain three different kinds of milk 
C. each have the same amount of fat 
D. are all the same price 
 Answer: C
Context: The World Health Organization (WHO) said that processed meat may be carcipogenic . Do you still dare eat cancer-linked processed meat ? Here are some comments on the website.
Bill (Australia) I'd rather live a short, pleasant life than a long, unhappy one, denying  myself tasty food just because some experts say it's not healthy. We should all enjoy the one life we have ---if I had listened to every piece of health advice I would never go anywhere, eat anything or enjoy life in any way. So, I won't change my habit. I am going to have bacon sandwich, glass of wine, burger, can of coke whenever I fell like it.
Tim (America) Is meat really as bad as smoking: I don't think so. According to the WHO 34,000 people die worldwide per year because they eat processed meat. In 2012, 8.2 million people died of cancer worldwide. That means if you eat a lot of processed meat you have a chance of being among the 0.41 percent of people dying of cancer because of processed meat. I'll take the chance.
Helen (Switzerland) The WHO doesn't say that just one bite of meat causes cancer, it is rather saying that people should vary their diet. People who eat more meat often have other unhealthy habits. They usually eat fewer fruits and vegetables and they also often exercise less.
Van (China) Perhaps this report will make people consider becoming vegetarians ( ). So for your health, the environment and future generations, it is not difficult; it just needs a change of attitude. There is a vast variety of other delicious food available to enjoy. 
 Question:Who have the most similar viewpoints ? 
A. Bill and Tim. 
B. Tim and Helen. 
C. Helen and Van. 
D. Bill and Van.

Context: Dickson Despommier, a public health professor at Columbia University in New York City developed an idea with his students nine years ago. They imagined people in cities growing crops inside a tall building. Tomatoes could grow on one floor of the skyscraper , potatoes on the next, small animals and fish on the floor above.
This vertical  farm, or ""farmscraper"", could have space for restaurants and other places that serve food, like schools or hospitals. They could serve foods that are truly locally grown.
But why would anyone want to build a farm indoors in a city? Dickson Despommier believes it will become necessary. The world needs to find places to produce enough food to feed the growing population. Space, he says, is an all-important issue.
The professor also points to the problems of traditional farms. They use a lot of freshwater. Their fertilizer and animal waste can pollute water resources. And their growing seasons can be limited.
But inside the vertical farm, crops could grow all year. And there would be no wind to blow away soil. Farmers would not have to worry about too much or too little rain, or about hot summers, freezing winters or insects. And without insects there would be no need for chemicals to kill them.
Farm machines that .use fossil fuels, like tractors, would not be needed either. And water could be recycled for drinking. ""The vertical farm reuses everything, so there is no waste,"" says Professor Despommier.
Even buildings could be saved. Old buildings could become new farms and provide jobs.
The professor has been actively proposing the idea to cities as far away as Dubai and Canada. But so far it exists only in plans and drawings, and a model at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.
Critics say building a farmscraper would cost too much, especially considering the price of land in many cities. Dickson Despommier estimates the cost at about twenty to thirty million dollars.
But he says the building would not have to be very tall. And his graduate students have found many empty lots and unused buildings in New York City that could provide space. 
 Question:According to the passage the purpose of proposing the idea of a farm scraper is to  _ 
A. find places to produce enough food 
B. serve food that are truly locally grown 
C. prevent polluting the limited land 
D. save fresh water

Context: Is it time to kick Russia out of the BRICs  ? If so, it may end up sounding like a famous ball-point pen maker-BIC. An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device ,the BRICs, should really be the BICs.
""Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?"" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreigh Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of ""The Russian Balance Sheet"", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes:
""The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas. ""
Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing
far better than Russia.
But the BRICs are not just about economy. As is mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while around 80 percent is for the other three.
At very least, however, Russia's economic underperformance and stock market outperfoumance does suggest it is indeed one of the group. 
 Question:According to Aslund, Russia shouldn't be a BRIC partly because  _  . 
A. Russia's economic performance is far worse than the other three 
B. Russia's leaders are not good at managing economy 
C. Russia has taken effective measures to improve its economy 
D. Russia will no longer attract investors from other countries 
 Answer: A

Context: 2009 is the year of what? Yes, it's the year of the Ox. But do you know that 2009 is also the year of the telescope? This year the world celebrates the 400thanniversary of Galileo's observations of the universe through an astronomical telescope  . In 1609, the Italian scientist first pointed a ""Dutch perspective glass"" at the night sky and made discoveries that changed mankind's conceptions of the universe. 
In honor of Galileo's discoveries, the United Nations and the International Astronomical Union have declared 2009 to be the International Year of Astronomy (IYA 2009).
IYA 2009 is a yearlong celebration of astronomy. Its goal is to spread knowledge of astronomy's contributions to society and culture and to inspire more interest in astronomy and science, especially among young people. The theme of the celebration is ""The Universe, Yours to Discover.""
One interesting aim of the IYA is to encourage more diversity   in the field of astronomy and physics. IYA organizers hope that the yearlong celebration of astronomy will inspire more females and underrepresented minorities to pursue   careers in science. An event that will help further that goal is 100 Hours of Astronomy (100 HA) that will fall on April. This event aims to have as many people as possible look through a telescope. From April 2ndto 5th, millions of people worldwide will peer through telescopes to catch their first glimpse   of the universe, just as Galileo's did 400 years ago. Sidewalk astronomy events will give city-dwellers   an excellent opportunity to see the moon, the planet Saturn, and other objects in position for early evening observations. 
Organizers hope that the activities of IYA will ""promote   a greater appreciation of the astronomy."" So join the fun. Look through a telescope this year!

Context: New crime prediction software should reduce not only the murder rate, but the rate of other crimes. Developed by Richard Berk, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, the software has already used in Baltimore and Philadelphia to predict which individuals on probation  or parole  are most likely to murder and to be murdered.
""When a person goes on probation or parole he is supervised  by an officer. The question is 'what level of supervision is appropriate?'"" said Berk. It used to be that parole officers used the person's criminal record, and their judgment to make decisions.
""This research replaces those _ ,"" he said.
Technology helps determine level of supervision. On average there is one murder for every 100,000 people. Even among high-risk groups the murder rate is one in 100. Predicting such a rare event is very difficult, but advances in computer technology works.
Years ago, the researchers made a dataset of more than 60,000 various crimes. Using the software they developed, they found some much more likely to commit murder when paroled or probated. They could identify eight future murderers out of 100.
Berk's software examines roughly two dozen variables , from criminal record to geographic location. The type of crimes, and more importantly, the age at which that crime was committed, were two of the most predictive variables.
""People assume that if someone murdered then they will murder in the future,"" said Berk. "" What really matters is what that person did as a young individual. Predicting future crimes sounds well. But we aren't anywhere near being able to do that.""
""Berk's scientific answer leaves policymakers with difficult questions. By labeling one group of people as high risk, and supervise them closely, there should be fewer murders, which the potential victims should be happy about. It also means that those high-risk individuals will be supervised more aggressively. For human rights advocates, that means punishing people who, most likely, will not commit a crime in the future,"" said Bushway. ""It comes down to a question of whether you would rather make these errors or those errors."" 
 Question:From Para 7, we can infer that  _  . 
A. the technology developed by Richard Berk will soon be widely used in the US 
B. the technology would not be widely accepted in the short term 
C. whether a person murders or not largely decided by his upbringing while young 
D. if a person murdered when he was fifty, he is sure to murder again while on probation

Based on the question, the option and the context select the most appropriate answer from the provided choices ""A."", ""B."", ""C."" and ""D."".
Context: When I asked my daughter which item she would keep; the phone, the car, the cooker, the computer, the TV, or her boyfriend, she said""the phone"". Personally, I could do without the phone entirely, which makes me unusual. Because the telephone is changing our lives more than any other piece of technology.
Point 1 The telephone creates the need to communicate, in the same way that more roads create more traffic. My daughter comes home from school at 4:00 pm and then spends an hour on the phone talking to the very people she has been at school with all day. If the phone did not exist, would she have anything to talk about?
Point 2 The mobile phone means that we are never alone. ""The mobile saved my life,""says Crystal Johnstone. She had an accident in her Volvo on the A45 between Otley and Skipton. Trapped inside, she managed to make the call that brought the ambulance  to her rescue.
Point 3 The mobile removes our secret. It allows marketing manager of Haba Deutsch, Carl Nicolaisen, to ring his sales staff all round the world at and time of day to ask where they are , where they are going, and how their last meeting went.
Point 4 The telephone separates us. Antonella Bramante in Rome says, ""We worked in separate offices but I could see him through the window. It was easy to get his number. We were so near----but we didn't meet for the first two weeks!""
Point 5 The telephone allows us to reach out beyond our own lives. Today we can talk to several complete strangers simultaneously ( ) on chat lines (at least my daughter does. I wouldn't know what to talk about). We can talk across the world. We can even talk to astronauts (if you know any) while they're space-walking. And, with the phone line hooked up to the computer, we can access  the Internet, the biggest library on Earth. 
 Question:Which of the following best shows people's attitude towards mobile phones? 
A. Mobile phones help people deal with the emergency. 
B. Mobile phones bring convenience as well little secret to people. 
C. Mobile phones are so important and should be encouraged. 
D. Mobile phones are part of people's life. 
 Answer: B
Context: In the case of mobile phones, change is everything. Recent research indicates that the mobile phone is changing not only our culture, but our very bodies as well.
First, let's talk about culture. The difference between the mobile phone and its parent, the fixed-line phone, is that a mobile number corresponds to a person, while a landline goes to a place. If you call my mobile, you get me. If you call my fixed-line phone, you get whoever answers it.
This has several implications . The most common one, however, and perhaps the thing that has changed our culture forever, is the ""meeting"" influence. People no longer need to make firm plans about when and where to meet. Twenty years ago, a Friday night would need to be arranged in advance. You needed enough time to allow everyone to get from their place of work to the first meeting place. Now,however, a night out can be arranged on the run. It is no longer ""see you there at 8"",but ""text me around 8 and we'll see where we all are.""
Texting changes people as well. In their paper, ""Insights into the Social and Psychological Effects of SMS Text Messaging"", two British researchers distinguished between two types of mobile phone users: the ""talkers"" and the ""texters""-those who prefer voice to text messages and those who prefer text to voice.
They found that the mobile phone's individuality and privacy gave texters the ability to express a whole new outer personality. Texters were likely to report that their family would be surprised if they were to read their texts. This suggests that texting allowed texters to present a self-image that differed from the one familiar to those who knew them well.
Another scientist wrote of the changes that mobiles have brought to body language. There are two kinds that people use while speaking on the phone. There is the ""speakeasy"": the head is held high, in a self-confident way, chatting away. And there is the ""spacemaker"": these people focus on themselves and keep out other people.
Who can blame them? Phone meetings get cancelled or reformed and camera- phones intrude on people's privacy. So, it is understandable if your mobile makes you nervous. But perhaps you needn't worry so much. After all, it is good to talk. 
 Question:We can infer from the passage that the texts sent by texters are 
A. quite revealing 
B. well written 
C. unacceptable by others 
D. shocking to others 
 Answer: A
Context: What would life be like if you give up using your cell phone? Will it become boring?
Twenty-eight eighth-graders at St. Matthew School in San Francisco will tell you it can still be rich and colorful.
These students took part in their school's ""tech-free"" challenge. They couldn't use cell phones for two weeks from Nov 11 to Nov 22.
The idea was to help students understand how technology has affected their lives, said Denise Uhl, principal of the school.
Uhl did a survey on technology usage among the eighth-graders before thinking of the challenge. She found that 84 percent of the students said they didn't like it ""when everyone was on their cell phones"", but they didn't know what to do about it. The answer was actually easy --- to stop constantly using cell phones.
To help students understand the point, Uhl created the activity. It was warmly welcomed among students.
""I wanted to sign up for the tech-free challenge because it was just really a good idea to do it,"" eighth-grader Joe told local newspaper Catholic San Francisco. ""I wanted to get closer to my family. And it really worked. I started to hang out with my family more. We watched more family movies and we played a lot of board games.""
The activity also helped students develop their interests.
During the two weeks, Lucas said he spent much more time outside, picking lemons in his garden. Maddie finished a painting and Cassie created a scarf on a loom  . 
 Question:The aim of the ""tech-free"" challenge was to   _  . 
A. help students focus on their study 
B. reduce the use of technology in school 
C. make studying more difficult for students 
D. help students understand how technology has affected their lives

Context: Thirdgeneration mobile phones, known as 3G, are the next big step for the telecom industry. Data speed in 3G networks is much quicker than present technology. This means users can have highspeed Internet access and enjoy video and CDquality music on their phones.
 ""Mobile data is not a dream; it's not an option but a requirement."" said Len Lauer, head of a US communications company,Sprint PCS,at a 3G conference in Bangkok earlier this month.
With 3G, you can forget about text messages telling you yesterday's news; a 3G phone can receive video news programs, updated four times a day. Internet access will also be much quicker, making it easier to surf the Web on your phone than on your computer at home.
Facetoface video calls
And don't worry about getting lost. 3G phones offer map services so you can find a new restaurant just by pressing a few keys on your handset.
However, the most impressive part of 3G technology is video calling. With live twoday video communication, you can have facetoface talks with friends and family on your mobile phone.
Many European countries have already launched the service. In May 2000 the US Government issued five licenses to run 3G wireless services, while the first 3G phones arrived in Italy in March this year.
International telecom companies can't wait to sell 3G in China, the world's largest mobile telecommunications market. But they will have to be patient. At the moment, China is busy testing its 3Gbased technologies, networks and services. This will be followed by a trial period before the phones can finally hit the shops.
""We need to create a pool of 3G customers before the largescale commercial launch of the service."" said Fan Yunjun, marketing manager for Beijing Mobile. ""We expect that the 3G licenses will be issued late next year. "" 
 Question:According to the text, which function of the following makes 3G technology most extraordinary? 
A. It can provide video news programs, updated four times a day. 
B. Users can have facetoface talks with friends and family on their mobile phones. 
C. Users can enjoy video and CDquality music on their phones. 
D. It'll be easier for users to surf the Web on their phone than on their computers at home.

Context: Tough new rules for pubs and clubs - including a ban on drinking games like the infamous ""dentist's chair"" - will be introduced in Britain this year in a bid to prevent the heavy drinking culture that costs the country billions of pounds a year.
Other promotions like ""all you can drink for 10 pounds"", speed drinking competitions and ""women drink free"" nights will also be forbidden.
But on the other hand, a large amount of offers of cheap alcohol in supermarkets - widely regarded as one of the main sources of Britain's problems with under-age and excessive   drinking - will not be affected. 
Doctors and health experts argue that the government has failed to use its most effective weapon, the taxation of minimum price controls on alcohol.
Home Secretary Alan Johnson said he did not want to target responsible drinkers on low incomes, but that the government and the industry had a duty to act on heavy drinking.
""These practices have a real impact on society, not to mention the lives of those who just want to enjoy a good night out."" he said.
The ""dentist's chair"", where drinks are poured directly into the mouth by others, was made famous by the celebrations of footballer Paul Gascoigne. That game and others that promote mass consumption   will be banned from April and publicans   will have to ensure free tap water is made available to the drinkers.
A second set of rules enforcing compulsory ID checks and making sure smaller alcoholic measures are on sale will come into effect in October.
The government says excessive drinking costs Britain up to 12 billion pounds a year and has announced that any pubs that go against the new rule will face severe punishment. 
Publicans and vendors   could lose their licenses, be fined up to 20,000 pounds or face six months in prison. 
 Question:New rules for pubs and clubs will be introduced in Britain to ban heavy drinking because   _  . 
A. people drink too much without paying taxes 
B. drinking in the country costs too much 
C. drinking competitions are very crazy 
D. drinking games are infamous

Context: Sparrow is a fast-food chain with 200 restaurants. Some years ago, the group to which Sparrow belonged was taken over by another company. Although Sparrow showed no sign of declining, the chain was generally in an unhealthy state. With more and more fast-food concepts reaching the market, the Sparrow menu had to struggle for attention. And to make matters worse, its new owner had no plans to give it the funds it required.
Sparrow failed to grow for another two years. Until a new CEO, Carl Pearson, decided to build up its market share. He did a survey, which showed that consumers who already used Sparrow restaurants were extremely positive about the chain, while customers of other fast-food chains were unwilling to turn away from them. Sparrow had to develop a new promotional campaign.
Pearson faced a battle over the future of the Sparrow brand. The chain's owner now favored rebranding Sparrow as Marcy's restaurants. Pearson resisted, arguing for an advertising campaign designed to convince customers that visits to Sparrow restaurants were fun. Such an attempt to establish a positive relationship between a company and the general public was unusual for that time. Pearson strongly believed that numbers were the key to success, rather than customers' speeding power. Finally, the owner accepted his idea.
The campaign itself changed the traditional advertising style of the fast-food industry. The TV ads of Sparrow focused on entertainment and featured original songs performed by a variety of stars. Instead of showing the superiority of a specific product, the intention was to put Sparrow in the hearts of potential customers.
Pearson also made other decisions which he believed would contribute to the new Sparrow image. For example, he offered to lower the rent of any restaurants which achieved a certain increase in their turnover   .
These efforts paid off, and Sparrow soon became one of the most successful fast-food chains in the regions where it operated. 
 Question:What was Pearson's achievement as a CEO? 
A. He managed to pay off Sparrow's debts. 
B. He made Sparrow much more competitive 
C. He helped Sparrow take over a company 
D. He improved the welfare of Sparrow employees 
 Answer: B
Context: Doubt usually comes along when companies talk very proudly how socially responsible they are, but Nike's decision to publish its entire list of contract suppliers on the Internet is harder to ignore. Nike's move opens a new front in companies' efforts to face their critics.
As Nike states in its latest corporate responsibility report, it is often hard to confirm exactly what is happening at about 800 factories that make its footwear and clothing under contract, many of which are remote.
Nike is hoping other companies will publish their factory lists, too. Hannah Jones, Nike's vice - president for corporate responsibility, says Nike would like to see the best - run contract factories using their social position as suppliers to the big brands to try to get more work.
Nike's approach moves corporate responsibility into its third age. The first age was corporate philanthropy - companies donating money to various community projects. The $170,   000,000 that Wal - Mart gave in charitable donations last year is a good example. Of course, some critics oppose even this form of corporate generosity , arguing that companies should concentrate on making profits, leaving it to shareholders to decide what charitable donations to make.
Corporate responsibility's second age was reputation management and risk avoidance. Second - age corporate responsibility supporters believe agreement with the wider community can warn a company of future risks in advance.
Nike is now trying to go a stage further. The company says it sees corporate responsibility as a way of improving its performance rather than just protecting its reputation. Factories which ensure that workers are registered  for social - security benefits often become more productive as a result. Attention to one aspect of staff management often leads to improvement in others.
If other companies publish supplier lists, they can together work out common standards, Nike says. At present, different companies have different standards, which make life difficult for the many factories that produce for more than one brand. If other companies published suppliers' locations, they could work out common standards and save money by relying on one another's checks. 
 Question:What effect could Nike's action have on its contract suppliers? 
A. Their managers will win promotion they desire. 
B. They will get donations from big brands easily. 
C. There's no need for their factories to be checked. 
D. They may have more opportunities to make money.

Context: Internet use appears to cause a decline in psychological well-being , according to research at Carnegie Mellon University.
Even people who spent just a few hours a week on the Internet experienced more depression and loneliness than those who logged on less frequently, the two-year study showed. And it wasn't that people who were already feeling bad spent more time on the Internet, but that using the Net actually appeared to cause the bad feeling.
Researchers are puzzling over the results, which were completely contrary to their expectations. They expected that the net would prove socially healthier than television, since the Net allows users to choose their information and to communicate with others.
The fact that Internet use reduces time available for family and friends may account for the drop in well-being, researchers suggested. Faceless, bodiless ""virtual"" communication may be less psychologically satisfying than actual conversation, and the relationship formed through it may be shallower. Another possibility is that exposure to the wider world via the Net makes users less satisfied with their lives.
""But it's important to remember this is not about the technology _ ; it's about how it is used,"" says psychologist Christine Riley of Intel, one of the study's sponsors. ""It really points to the need for considering social effects in terms of how you design applications and services for technology.""

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals

Context: A lot of small business owners put themselves in _ in their own companies.Consider this scene:the company owner who has thirty individuals working for him in the business does all the work.
Stop the actual wrong belief that you're the only one who can do the JOB!
You are an individual. _ .The best way to replace yourself is not through someone else,but with a System! A system or program doesn't always make reference to something high-tech.It's more about the actual administration process flow that gets issues running smoothly.
Systemizing your business is vitally important for the success of the company.About 80%of what's completed in your business can be systemized.Take a moment to determine all of the routine things that are done in your company.Now record the best way to achieve these duties.
However,creating systems isn't enough.You have to ensure that the methods are simple to follow,and easy to complete.If you do not allow it to be easy,it won't be done,or at best it won't be consistent.
With systems and processes in position.it's simply using a few people to operate individual systems.A great number of companies that possess established systems have made great achievements through the years.Burger King is a good actual life example.

Context: prefix = st1 /China's economic growth 'hard to predict'
The worsening global economic situation makes it difficult for Chinato predict its growth for next year, a senior official said on Friday.
""How fast China's economy will grow next year is uncertain,"" Liu He, deputy director of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Finance and Economy Work, told China Daily.
""To a large  _ , the rate will be decided by the external situation,"" Liu said during a discussion with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and other economists in Beijing.
This year, GDP is estimated to grow at 9.4 or 9.5 percent, down from 10.6 percent last year, he said. However, the impact of the current financial turbulence ""on our economy is much less than on the rest of the world"", he said.
Nicholas Stern, a former UK government advisor, also told China Daily it will take at least one or two years for the world to recover from the recession, which is now spreading from the US and the UK to the rest of the world.
""We don't know how long the recession will last, but it is unlikely to be short,"" he said.
Liu said China can use the downturn as an opportunity to restructure its economy, which has relied heavily on government investment, foreign trade and low-cost technology over the past years.
""When the economy is experiencing fast growth, companies are unwilling to upgrade their technologies,"" Liu said.
""The slowdown gives such firms the opportunity to enhance their competitive edge through better technologies.""

Context: BEIJING, Feb 13 -- Never has China's economic growth attracted so much global attention. The shock waves from the financial crisis   that started in the United States have spread across the entire world, sending developed nations, including Japan and those of Europe, into serious recession . The world is now holding out hope that China, with its massive potential, will serve as the engine to fuel global economic growth.
But China's real economic growth slowed sharply to 6.8 percent in the October-December quarter. For China, this rate of economic expansion must be as disappointing as negative growth is for Japan. Beijing has set an official goal of achieving a minimum annual growth rate of 8 percent -- a pace it regards as important to ensuring job security.
The Chinese government is apparently confident the nation will achieve the minimum growth target of 8 percent in 2009. At the World Economic Forum's annual meeting of political and business leaders in Davos, Switzerland, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao stressed the Chinese economy began to show signs of recovery late last year.
Last week, however, the International Monetary Fund predicted that China's economic growth in 2009 will be 6.7 percent. China's economic outlook is likely to keep both hope and anxiety for the time being.
China's impressive economic growth has been fueled by swelling exports and massive investment  in equipment to produce goods for overseas. But the US, Japanese and European economies, which have absorbed the bulk  of China's exports, are expected to shrink simultaneous in 2009, for the first time since the end of World War II. For the first time since it started serious efforts to turn itself into a market economy in the 1990s, China is facing the challenge of maintaining healthy economic growth without depending on external demand.
Expansion of domestic   demand holds a key to China's success in tackling this challenge. Consumer spending accounts for only 35 percent of China's gross  ) domestic product. The ratio  is considerably lower than the 70 percent for the United States and the nearly 60 percent for Japan. That is because the middle class - the group that should lead consumer spending - is still relatively small in China, where the benefits of the nation's strong economic growth in recent years have mostly eluded rural villages and low-income earners. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is NOT true? 
A. The financial crisis has had bad effects on many countries including China. 
B. China's economic growth has been depending on exports. 
C. If China intends to keep the same economic growth, it must increase goods for overseas. 
D. Consumer spending in China is much lower than that of the US.

Context: You may not pay much attention to your daily elevator ride. Many of us use a lift several times a day without thinking about it. But Lee Gray, PhD of America, has made it his business to examine this overlooked form of public transport. ""The lift becomes this interesting social space where manners are sort of strange, ""Gray told the BBC, ""They are socially very interesting but often very awkward places.""
We walk in and usually turn around to face the door. If someone else comes in, we may have to move. And here, according to Gray, lift users unthinkingly go through a set pattern of movements. He explained that when you are the only one inside a lift, you can do whatever you want -- it's your own little box.
If there are two of you, you go into different corners, standing diagonally across from each other to create distance.
When a third person enters, you will unconsciously form a triangle. And when there is a fourth person it becomes a square, with someone in every corner. A fifth person is probably going to have to stand in the middle.
New comers to the lift will need to size up the situation when the doors slide open and then act decisively. Once in, for most people the rule is simple -- look down, or look at your phone.
Why are we so awkward in lifts?
    ""You don't have enough space,"" Professor Renneberg, a German psychologist, told the BBC. ""Usually when we meet other people we have about an arm's length of distance between us. And that's not possible in most elevators. The easiest way not to be awkward is to avoid eye contact."" 
 Question:According to Gray, when people enter an elevator, they usually   _  . 
A. turn around and greet one another 
B. look around or examine their phone 
C. make eye contact with those in the elevator 
D. try to keep a distance from other people

The boss knew John worked very hard for the years. He thought for a moment and said, ""I hope you will do one more thing for our company before you leave.""
John agreed.  The boss asked him to go and find anyone selling watermelons in the market. John went and returned soon. He said he had found a man selling water melons. The boss asked how much they per kilo. John shook his head and went back to the seller to ask and returned to tell the boss $1.2 per kilo.
The boss told John to wait a second, and he called Bobby to come to his office. He asked Bobby to go and find anyone selling watermelons in the market.  Bobby went, returned and said, ""Boss, only one person is selling watermelons.  $1.2 per kg, and $10 for 10 kg. He has 340 melons in all, 58 of which are on the table. Every melon weighs about 2 kg. Brought from the South two days ago, they are fresh and red. ""
John was impressed and realized the difference between himself and Bobby. He decided not to resign but to learn from Bobby.

Context: With the press of a button, a person with severe spinal cord  injuiy is able to walk again, thanks to the Walking Assistive Exoskeleton Robot (WAER).
Powered suits that could help paralyzed  people walk and others lift and carry heavy loads with ease have been a dream since late 19th century. But they can realize their dreams in the 21st century.
The 20-kilogram robot has four battery-powered motors that can run for up to three hours. Inventor Wu Chenghua, from Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research Institute, says it has successfully been in tests on 12 patients. ""We have learned from our research process that patients whose injuries are below the fourth chest joint  are able to use our robot to stand, walk and sit down,"" he said.
Since walking contributes to muscle exercise, Wu says patients receive some additional benefits. ""In the clinical process, we would check their bone mineral density  ,and we found that the bone mineral densities of these patients had been improved."" he said. Wu says his exoskeleton may be available for consumers by 2018.
Meanwhile, baggage handlers at Tokyo's Haneda Airport will soon start testing a similar robot, developed by the Japanese firm Cyberdyne. The battery-powered robot weighs only 3
lift a heavy object, the machine monitors the movemen"",says Yoshiyuki Sankai, the developer and CEO of Cyberdyne.
""This robot suit monitors the signal from the human nerve  system to support the waist's movement,"" Sankai said, ""It self-adjusts the level support to reduce the load on the human waist, light and smart. We believe that it will change the life of paralyzed people in many ways and have a promising future.""

B. Worried. 
C. Doubtful. 
D. Puzzled.

Context: There are stock markets   in large cities in many countries. Stock markets in Paris,
London, Tokyo, Shanghai and New York are among the largest and most well-known. The stock, also called stock exchange,  is a place where people can buy or sell shares of a factory or  company. And each share means certain ownership  of a factory or company.
Different people go to stock markets. Some are rich, who want to get more money than they
have. Others are not very rich, who buy stocks to try to become rich. Still others buy stocks as
part of their plan to save money.

Context: Today, I will tell you a story about AbdulRahman, a friend of mine, who was the victim of the big name DHL. I am sure that 90% of you have at least heard of it. It is known for being the best company when it comes to shipping. It is thought to be fast ,reliable and safe. 
AbdulRahman's brother bought him a mobile phone while he was in the United Kingdom. He wanted to send it to him here in Kuwait .  AbdulRahman specifically asked him to send it through DHL. He trusted the company that much, as most people do.
But in the end, even though the company told him that it would take up to 5 days for the phone to arrive at AbdulRahman's door, he never received it. And after two weeks of him calling them and hearing the same response ""We will investigate the matter, and let you know of our decision by next week. We might pay you back up to 50% of the item's cost.""
So they are not paying him the full price of the thing they have lost, or as we think, they have stolen. We have reason to think that way, because according to the records, the mobile phone went ""missing"" while it was in a ""sorting facility"" of the company.
Last Tuesday, they stopped telling him ""We are investigating the matter"" and officially said, ""We ended the investigation. Your shipment is missing."" We are still waiting to hear their ""decision"" about whether they will try to make it up to him, by ""maybe"" paying him up to 50% , and nothing more. 
 Question:What does the writer think of DHL's response to the case? 
A. It is quick and in time. 
B. It is not bad. 
C. It is disappointing 
D. It is late but satisfying

   It was while they were discussing this point that the Colonel said, ""You know you might get material that would be very useful to you in your work. I'll tell you an incident that occurred only recently. Very dramatic. A foreign government minister went down to a Mediterranean resort to recover from a cold and he had some very important documents with him that he kept in a dispatch case . A day or two after he arrived, he picked up a beautiful blonde at some restaurant or other, and he got very friendly with her. He took her back to his hotel, and when he came to himself in the morning, the lady and the dispatch-case had disappeared. They had one or two drinks up in his room and his theory is that when his back was turned the woman slipped a drug in his glass.

Context: The United States: Fliers may want to have their tickets in hand before catching their planes, but the airline companies are doing everything they can to bring forward cost-saving ticketless flight--no paper needed, just a ticket number and a photo ID. Anyone who buys a Northwest E-ticket through the airline's computer service by June 16 will get an award. Next time you fly, you can buy another ticket for a friend for $99, good anywhere in the US or Canada, along with the lowest ticket prices. Some airlines offer extra frequent-flier miles for the ticketless crowd. And there are rising punishments for paper lovers. American, Northwest, United, and US Airways have raised the cost for lost-ticket replacement to $70 from either $60 or $50. The airlines insist that the increase in price is not meant to push travelers toward E-tickets but only covers the increasing cost of replacing and tracking a missing ticket. 
 Question:Who are the paper lovers mentioned in the text? 
A. People who like to have paper airline tickets. 
B. People who love paper products of various kinds. 
C. People who travel with paper on a plane.

Context: Frank Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York., in 1852. His family were very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for showing goods to attract people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends ( ) for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said five cents each. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store., selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1000 stores in the US and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always run his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: "" The customer is always right.""

Context: Joker found one of the biggest diamonds in the world right in his own back yard. He sold the stone to a diamond dealer for over three hundred thousand dollars.

The cutter studied the diamond for twelve whole months.
When he felt he was ready to start work, he discovered a flaw   . He had to begin his calculations all over again, or he might have made the stone useless. Six months passed, and Kaplan finally said to the owner, ""I am ready to start my work. There will be one excellent diamond that will be comparable one excellent diamond of first-class quality    "" Kaplan waited a few more days until he felt he was in the best physical and mental   condition  possible. He picked up his tools   and held his breath as he made the diamond exactly as he promised.

A. the dealer lost a lot of money

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.

Context: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth.
An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, ""the worst came to the worst"". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door.
The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced.
Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank. He says the plant seeds would only be used when all other seeds are gone for some reason. Norwayfirst proposed the idea in the 1980s. But security concerns delayed the plan. At that time, the Soviet Union was meeting inRomeof the Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the above passage? 
A. The government of Norwaywill perform the project alone. 
B. Seeds to be collected there were produced ten thousands years ago. 
C. Spitsbergen is chosen because it is free of the threat unclear war forever. 
D. Temperature is a major consideration when choosing the storage place.

Context: Londoners are great readers. They buy vast numbers of newspapers and magazines and of books -- especially paperbacks , which are still comparatively cheap in spite of ever-increasing rises in the costs of printing.  They still continue to buy ""proper"" books, too, printed on good paper and bound between hard covers.
There are many streets in London containing shops which specialize in book-selling.  Perhaps the best known of these is Charring Cross Road in the very heart of London. Here bookshops of all sorts and sizes are to be found, from the celebrated one which boasts of being ""the biggest bookshop in the world"" to the tiny, dusty little places which seem to have been left over from Dickens' time. Some of these shops stock , or will obtain, any kind of book, but many of them specialize in second-hand books, in art books, in foreign books, in books on philosophy, politics or any other of the myriad subjects about which books may be written. One shop in this area specializes only in books about ballet!
Although it may be the most convenient place for Londoners to buy books, Charring Cross Road is not the cheapest. For the really cheap second-hand volumes, the collector must venture  off the beaten track, to Farringdon Road, for example, in the East Central district of London. Here there is nothing so impressive as bookshops. Instead, the booksellers come along each morning and pour out their sacks of books onto small barrows  which line the gutters . And the collectors, some professionals and some amateurs , have been waiting for them. In places like this one can still, occasionally, pick up for a few pence an old volume that may be worth many pounds. 
 Question:If you want to buy really cheap second-hand books, you must   _  . 
A. venture in a most busy street 
B. venture away from a busy street 
C. take the risk of going to the beaten track 
D. take the risk of wasting time to hunt them in less noticeable streets 
 Answer: D
Context: The Guidance Department   at Burrville High School has a staff   of eleven. Most of their work is done with the students. But the staff sees a lot of parents, too. 
""Parent meetings form a clear monthly pattern,"" says Mildred Foreman, Guidance Director. ""This pattern stays much the same from year to year. The busy months are October, March and May."" 
September starts rather slowly. Few parents come in. Most of them want to discuss the schedules. October brings many behaviour problems. Some parents are called in. Others come by themselves. Things quiet down in November. December is a quiet month. ""It's the holiday,"" Ms. Foreman says. ""People want to come in, I know, but they decide to wait until after New Year's Day."" 
Report cards go home just before Christmas holidays. Bad marks bring parents in as school reopens. This happens again in March, another report card month. May is always the year's busiest month. That's when parents realize that their children might be held back  . They come in to see if anything can be done before things are decided in June. 
 Question:In the sentence ""The staff sees a lot of parents too."" the word ""see"" can be replaced with ""  _  "". 
A. notice

Context: I needed to get some money so, after Christmas, I took a job in the clothes department at Graham's for the first fortnight of the January sale.I can't say that I enjoyed it, but it was an experience I'll never forget.
I could never understand why there were so many things in the sales, where did they all come from? Now I know the secret! Firstly, there is the special winter stock   and the stock that people buy all the year round;  some of these things are slightly reduced.Secondly, there are the summer clothes they couldn't sell last year; these are heavily reduced to clear them.Thirdly, there are cheap clothes bought in specially for the sales; these are put out at high prices ten days before the sale begins and then are reduced by 60% in the sale.Clever! Lastly, they buy in ""seconds""(clothes not in perfect condition) for the sale and they are sold very cheaply.
When I arrived half an hour before opening on the first day of the sale, there was already a queue around three sides of the building.This made me very nervous.
When the big moment arrived to open the doors, the security guards looking less confident than usual, came up to them, keys in hand.The moment they had unlocked the doors, they hid behind the doors for protection as the noisy crowd charged in.I couldn't believe my eyes; this wasn't shopping, it was a battlefield! One poor lady couldn't keep her feet and was knocked over by people pushing from behind.
Clothes were flying in all directions as people searched for the sizes, colours and styles they wanted.Quarrels broke out.Mothers were using their small children to crawl through people's legs and get hold of things they couldn't get near themselves.
Within minutes I had half a dozen people pushing clothes under my nose; each wanting to be the first served.Where had the famous English queue gone? The whole day continued like that, but I kept my temper81 was taking money hand over fist and began to realize why twice a year, Graham's were happy to turn their expensive store into a battlefield like this.
In the sale fever; people were spending money like water without thinking whether they needed what they were buying.As long as it was a bargain it was OK.You won't believe this.But as soon as I got home I crashed out for four hours.Then I had dinner and went back to bed, fearing the sound of the alarm which would tell me to get ready for the second day of the sale. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is true? 
A. The customers gave up the queuing, for which the English are famous. 
B. The customers kept their temper while looking for clothes they wanted. 
C. Small children enjoyed crawling though people's legs. 
D. The security guards were fearless of the crowd.

Context: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth.
An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, ""the worst came to the worst"". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door.
The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced.
Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank. He says the plant seeds would only be used when all other seeds are gone for some reason. Norwayfirst proposed the idea in the 1980s. But security concerns delayed the plan. At that time, the Soviet Union was meeting inRomeof the Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the above passage? 
A. The government of Norwaywill perform the project alone. 
B. Seeds to be collected there were produced ten thousands years ago. 
C. Spitsbergen is chosen because it is free of the threat unclear war forever. 
D. Temperature is a major consideration when choosing the storage place. 
 Answer: D
Context: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the eleventh largest nation in Europe. England, Wales and Scotland make up the island of Great Britain, which takes up most of the Britain Isles. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are mountainous. The highest mountain is Ben Nevis in Scotland. Plains and valleys cover much of England. The British climate is mild.
About 58 million people live in the United Kingdom. Few other countries are so crowded. Four out of five people live in cities such as Belfast, Glasgow, and London. London is the capital. Great Britain grows half of the food it needs. Its industries help to pay for the food that is bought from abroad. The United Kingdom manufactures a wide range of goods. Service industries, such as tourism, that provide services rather than producing goods, are increasing. Traditional industries, such as coal mining, are declining. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the statements is true? 
A. Great Britain grows all of the food it needs. 
B. The United Kingdom manufactures a narrow range of goods. 
C. The speed of tourism in UK is increasing faster than producing goods. 
D. The coal mining is also increasing fast. 
 Answer: C
Context: A British company has proposed releasing genetically modified(GM)   diamondback moths, which would reduce the population of the vegetable-eating insects. Males carrying a deadly gene would be released, which would cause their young ones to die immediately. Then the fall in their numbers could help increase production for farmers.
Oxitec, the company which came up with the idea, hopes to begin trials  next year, but some groups are saying no to them,, saying the untested technology could threaten wildlife and human health.
""Mass releases of GM insects into the British countryside would be impossible to recall if anything went wrong. Changing one part of an ecosystem  can have knock-on-effects on others in ways that are poorly understood. This could include an increase in different types of pests. Wildlife that feeds on insects could be impaired if there are changes to their food supply,"" said Dr Helen Wallace, the director of Gene-Watch UK.
Hadyn Parry, Oxitec's chief executive, said that there was demand from farmers for the technology and that using GM insects to kill the pests that feed on food crops is better for the environment than chemical sprays. The firm is developing a number of GM insects that would be used in Britain and around the world to protect crops and fight disease in humans.
Oxitec has contacted the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to ask what controls should be put in place around GM moth trials. A spokesman said that while its officials and advisers have discussed Oxitec's plans, there has not been a formal application for a trial. As a result, the department has not reached a view on whether it should go ahead. 
 Question:According to Hadyn Parry, what is farmers' attitude towards the technology? 
A. They are afraid to use it. 
B. They don't care about it. 
C. They support the use of it. 
D. They don't think it will work.

Context: Eco City Farms  are becoming more popular in cities and towns around the United states.
Eco City Farms in Edmonton, Maryland, is located near shopping centers, car repair shops and homes. The neighborhood is a working-class community . People do not have very much money. And they have limited access  to fresh food in markets.
Over the past two years, the farm has attracted volunteers from the community like Marcy Clark. She schools her four children at home. On a recent day she brought them to Eco City Farms for a lesson. Her son Alston Clark thinks his experience is very valuable.""I like coming out here,"" he says,"" You know, you connect with the earth, where your food comes from. You appreciate the food a little bit more.""
Margaret Morgan started Eco City Farms. She thinks of it as a place where people can learn to live healthier lives. ""Growing food in a community brings people together,"" she continues, ""Every piece of what we do here is a demonstration  to show people everything about how to have an eco-friendly community."" she says. From the Eco City Farms people come to know that they are not only growing food and raising chickens and bees, but improving the soil with compost made from food waste.
Eco City Farms is an experimental operation. The farm gets its power not from the local electricity networks, but from the sun with solar panels. In winter, the green house use a geothermal system.
Vegetables can be grown all year. So once a week, all winter long, neighbors like Chris Moss and her three children bike to the farm to pick up a share of the harvest.
""I like eating the vegetables ""says five-year-old Owen Moss.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B
Context: There is a place where Christmas lives all year long. It is called Bronner's Christmas Wonderland in Frankenmuth, Michigan. The family-owned business calls itself the world's largest Christmas store. The late Wally Bronner started the business in 1945.
Wayne Bronner, Wally's son, is president and CEO of what is now a multi-million dollar corporation. He learned the business from an early age. Some of his best memories are traveling to other countries with his father to find new products for the store.
Bronner's sells more than 50,000 holiday products from 70 nations. Half of the products cost less than ten dollars. Wayne Bronner says the demand for small objects to hang on Christmas trees has expanded over the years. People spend more time, effort and money into decorating their homes with these ornaments, lights and religious scenes. Bronner's is famous for its nativity scenes which show the birth of Jesus Christ.
Michigan has the nation's highest unemployment rate. Bronner's has been affected by the recession, too. But not in reduced sales.
Wayne Bronner said: ""Even though people are spending less, we're having more people visit here. And as a result we've actually had a sales increase."" Bronner's success is also linked to community cooperation and investment. Frankenmuth is a town of 5,000 people in eastern Michigan's farm country. The town was settled by Bavarian Germans in the 1800s. It has kept its traditions alive in buildings and restaurants. 
Bavarian cultural themes and Bronner's huge store bring 3,000,000 visitors a year. The town is the most popular place for tourists in the state. Bronner's business is aimed at a single day of the year. But that is not too different from other businesses. 
""About half of our business is done in the last quarter of the year, in the last three months. And actually when you compare that with most retailers, that follows the same pattern."" Wayne Bronner says the family's long-term planning and willingness to reinvest profits has developed the company into what it is today. Still, it does not hurt to build a business on a holiday which is celebrated worldwide. Currently, about only two percent of sales are overseas. But Wayne Bronner sees room for growth, especially through the Internet. 
 Question:Bronner's success lies in the following EXCEPT  _  . 
A. community cooperation and investment 
B. the family's long-term planning 
C. aiming its business at a single day of the year 
D. the willingness to reinvest profits

Context: What was the origin of the oil which now drives our motorcars and aircraft? Scientists are confident about the formation of coal, but they do not seem so sure when asked about oil. They think that the oil under the surface of the earth originated in the distant past, and was formed from living things in the sea. Countless billions of small sea creatures and plants lived and sank to the seabed. They were covered with huge deposits of mud and by process of chemistry, pressure and temperature were changed through long ages into what we know as oil. For these creatures to become oil, it was necessary that they should be imprisoned between layers of rock for a great length of time. The statement that oil originated in the sea is confirmed by a glance at a map showing the chief oilfields of the world. Very few of them are far distant from the oceans of today. In some places gas' and oil come up to the surface of the sea from its bed. The rocks in which oil is found are of the marine origin too. They are rocks which were laid down by the action of water on the' bed of the ocean. Almost always the remains of shells, and other proofs of sea life are found close to the oil. A very common sedimentary rock is called shale, which is a soft rock and was obviously formed by being deposited on the seabed. And when there is shale, there is likely to be oil. 
There is a lot of luck in drilling for oil The drill may just miss the oil although it is near; on the other hand, it may strike oil at a fairly high level When the drill goes down, it brings up soil. The soil from various depths are examined for. Traces of oil. If they are disappointed at one place, the drillers go to another. Great sums of money have been spent, for example, in the deserts of Egypt, in looking for oil. Sometimes little is found. When we buy a few gallons of petrol for our cars, we pay not only the cost of the petrol, but also part of the cost of the search that is always going on. 
There are four main areas of the world where deposits of oil appear. The first is that of the Middle East. Another is the area between North and South America, and a third, between Asia and Australia. The fourth area is the part near the North Pole. When there is no more oil in the present oilfields to bring up, it is possible that this cold region may become the scene of busy oil activity. 
 Question:From the passage, we can infer that   _  . 
A. the North Pole is the largest oil field in the world 
B. the Middle East has the finest oil in the main oil areas 
C. people haven't opened any oilfield in the North Pole 
D. only in oceans can we find oil 
 Answer: C
Context: Three Yale University professors agreed in a discussion that the automobile was what one of them called ""Public Health Enemy No. 1 in this century"". Besides polluting the air and overcrowding the cities, cars are involved in more than half the disastrous accidents, and they contribute to heart disease ""because we won't walk anywhere any more,"" said Richard Weeinaman, professor of medicine and public health.
Speaking of many of those man-made dangers of the automobile, Arthur W. Galson, professor of biology, said it was possible to make a kerosene-burning turbine car that would ""lessensmog by a very large factor"". But he expressed doubt whether Americans were willing to give up moving about the countryside at 90 miles per hour in a large vehicle. ""America seems wedded to the motor car--every family has to have at least two, and one has to be a convertible   with 300 horsepower,"" professor Galson continued. ""Is this the way of life that we choose because we treasure these values?""
For professor Sears, part of the blame lies with ""a society that regards profit as a supreme value, under the illusion that anything that's technically possible is, therefore, morally justified"". Professor Sears also called the country's dependence on its modern automobiles ""terrible economics"" because of the large horsepower used simply ""moving one individual to work"". But he admitted that Americans have painted themselves into a corner by allowing the national economy to become so dependent on the automobile industry.
""The solution,"" Dr Weeinerman said, ""is not finding a less dangerous fuel but a different system of inner city transportation. Because of the increasing use of cars, public transportation has been allowed to wither   and grow worse, so that if you can't walk to where you want to go, you have to have a car in most cities,"" he declared. This, in turn, Dr Weeinerman contended, is responsible for the ""arteriosclerosis  "" of public roads, for the pollution of the inner city and for the middle-class movement to the suburbs. 
 Question:It can be inferred from the passage that  _  . 
A. Americans prefer cars to anything else 
B. Americans are interested in fast automobiles 
C. kerosene-burning engines cause more problems 
D. kerosene-burning engines are green transportation

Context: The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is the eleventh largest nation in Europe. England, Wales and Scotland make up the island of Great Britain, which takes up most of the Britain Isles. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales are mountainous. The highest mountain is Ben Nevis in Scotland. Plains and valleys cover much of England. The British climate is mild.
About 58 million people live in the United Kingdom. Few other countries are so crowded. Four out of five people live in cities such as Belfast, Glasgow, and London. London is the capital. Great Britain grows half of the food it needs. Its industries help to pay for the food that is bought from abroad. The United Kingdom manufactures a wide range of goods. Service industries, such as tourism, that provide services rather than producing goods, are increasing. Traditional industries, such as coal mining, are declining. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the statements is true? 
A. Great Britain grows all of the food it needs. 
B. The United Kingdom manufactures a narrow range of goods. 
C. The speed of tourism in UK is increasing faster than producing goods. 
D. The coal mining is also increasing fast.

Context: The US will seek to expand its own oil production in an attempt to reduce dependence on imported oil and bring down fuel prices , President Obama says . New contracts for exploration will be signed in non-protected areas of Alaska and in the Gulf of Mexico.
In his weekly speech , the President insisted the US could reduce its need for imported oil and improve safety. Using his speech to tell Americans that he understood their concerns about rising prices, President Obama focused particularly on the price of fuel, which has risen in recent months.
US consumers have historically enjoyed cheap fuel , but have seen prices rise in recent months even though US oil production in 2010 reached its highest level for seven years.
Although the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 was serious, Mr Obama said the Gulf remained a key part of the country's future energy supply.
The President's proposals  come after Republicans   introduced a series of proposals that would expand and speed up oil and gas production.
The White House has criticized the Republican proposals for safety reasons , but Mr Obama was clear in his speech that he felt safety and environmental standards could be maintained even though production might rise.
"" I believe that we should continue to expand oil production in America --even as we increase safety and environmental standards ,""he said.
""As a nation, we should be investing in the clean, renewable sources of energy that are the solution to high gas prices.""
Mr Obama has previously called for a step-change in energy policy, saying the US must move towards getting 80%of its electricity from clean energy sources by 2035. 
 Question:What can we learn from the text ? 
A. The US has got most of its electricity from clean energy. 
B. US oil production is too small to keep the present low fuel prices. 
C. The US produced the most oil in 2010 in its history. 
D. The Gulf is still important in energy supply in spite of the oil spill in 2010.

 ""Excuse me"",said a young man,standing shyly at the open church door. ""I'm here to pick up an Easter basket for my daughter. Am I in the right place?""""Well,we have baskets,but they're not Easter baskets for kids;they're food baskets,""I explained.
That morning I arrived at St.Michael's Church in Carmichael,California,to help give out the baskets to needy families for Easter. To make sure every family would receive one,we had handed out numbers to them that matched the basket they were supposed to receive. Each one contained a whole ham,potatoes,bread,vegetables,and a pie--enough food to help feed a family for a week.
""Why don't you come in?""I said to the man. He looked disappointed. He shook his head and said,""I can't...My daughter is waiting for me over there. I'm grateful for the food,but when I heard you were giving away baskets for Easter...well,I thought they would be Easter baskets for children."" He continued,""I promised my daughter one,and I wanted to surprise her.""
I felt bad,but there was nothing I could do. The man handed me his number,and I walked over to the baskets. A bulge in one of the baskets caught my eye. ""What is that?""I wondered. Leaning over and looking more closely,I could see,unmistakably,an Easter basket--filled with candy,chocolate,and Easter eggs. One of the volunteers must have added it by mistake!I thought. Then I looked at the man's number in my hand. Well,he'll be...
""Happy Easter,""I said to the man,handing him the only food basket with an Easter basket inside--the very same basket with his number on it. ""Someone knew just what you needed.""

Context: My dad loved pennies, especially those with wheat. Those were the pennies he grew up with in Iowa and he didn't have many.
When I was a kid, Dad and I would go for walks together. We'd spy coins along the way. Whenever I picked up a penny, he'd ask, ""Is it a wheat?"" It always thrilled him when we found one of those special coins produced between 1909 and 1958, the year of my birth. He told me he often dreamed of finding coins. ""I have that dream too!"" I told him. It was our secret connection.
Dad died in 2002. One grey day, not long after his death, I was walking down Fifth Avenue and I found myself in front of the oldest church in Manhattan, which my father had been attending. I was greeted in warmly. The song was Dad's favorite, one we'd sung at his funeral.
After the service, I walked out, stepped onto the sidewalk--and there was a penny. I picked it up, and sure enough, it was a wheat, a 1944, a year my father was serving on a ship in the South Pacific. Then, wheat pennies began turning up on the sidewalks everywhere. I got most of the important years: his birth year, the war years, the year he met my mom, the year they got married. But, no 1958 penny-my year.
The next Sunday, after the service, I was walking up Fifth Avenue and spotted a penny in the middle of the street. It was a busy street, but I risked my safety and got it.
A wheat! There was my birthday.
 _ 
 Question:How did the author find the penny with his year? 
A. He searched hard and found it. 
B. He dug in the street in order to get it. 
C. He sang a religious song in order to find it. 
D. He found it by chance but got it by trying hard. 
 Answer: D
Context: My husband can plan wonderful surprise celebrations for me.Recently,however,I told him I didn't want him to plan one for my upcoming birthday.
""Why?"" he asked.
""I am embarrassed being the center of attention,""  I quickly explained.
Later,I began to think more deeply about this reason. Then I remembered the surprise celebration I had planned for my friend Nancy on her 60th birthday. We  were roommates on a threeweek tour following the Silk Road on those famous steppes   --and through the  mountains--of central Asia.
That  afternoon  we  had  arrived  at  our  hotel  in Samarkand,Uzbekistan. The young man at the hotel desk told me about a bakery about 10 minutes away. After giving me detailed directions,he added,""Your nose will let you know when you arrive there.""
The temperature was 40 degC.Soon,
  _  
proved to be an unfailing guide. Outside the bakery,a delicious smell greeted me.
There were several kinds of breads,cookies,and cakes on display. There were also beautiful iced cakes. I chose a cake topped with powdered sugar.
Later at the Karim Bek Restaurant,Nancy didn't see the young waiter walk up the steps with the cake.When I began singing""Happy Birthday,""everyone at our table--except Nancy--joined in.
It took her a moment to realize what was happening. Then the grinning    guest of honor thanked me,blew out the candles on the cake,and ate three pieces of it.
Today,after reliving this experience in my mind,I told my husband to ignore my request.I now understand what a surprise party is about:It is not about having a surprise party but rather the delight in giving it. That is what brings the satisfying joy. 
 Question:Why did the author go to the bakery? 
A. To get some bread for her journey. 
B. To experience the local taste in Samarkand. 
C. To buy a birthday cake for her friend. 
D. To eat some iced cakes to cool herself down.

Context: Climbers at the top of Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, will now be able to make video calls and surf the Internet on their mobile phones, a Nepalese   telecom group claims.
Ncell, a branch company of Swedish phone giant TeliaSonera, said on Thursday it had set up a high-speed third-generation (3G) phone base station at an altitude of 5,200 metres in the Everest region.
""Today we made the world's highest video call from Mount Everest base camp successfully. The coverage   of the network will reach up to the peak of Mount Everest,"" Ncell Nepal chief Pasi Koistinen told reporters in Kathmandu.
The installation   will also help tens of thousands of tourists and hikers who visit the world's highest mountain every year.
Climbers who reached its 8,848-metre peak previously depended on expensive satellite phones and a voice-only network set up by China Mobile in 2007 on the Chinese side of the mountain.
""This is a great milestone for mobile communications as the 3G high speed Internet will bring faster, more affordable telecommunication services from the world's tallest mountain,"" said Lars Nyberg, chief executive of TeliaSonera, which owns 80 percent of Ncell.
The 3G services will be fast enough to make video calls and use the Internet, said the company, which also claimed the world's lowest 3G base at 1,400 metres below sea level in a mine in Europe.
Despite the installation in Mount Everest, telecom services cover less than one-third of the 28 million people of Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world.
TeliaSonera said it planned to invest $ 100 million in the next year to ensure that mobile coverage increases to more than 90 per cent of the Himalayan nation's population.
The 3G network on Mount Everest puts TeliaSonera ahead of state-controlled Nepal Telecom, Indian-owned United Telecom and China Mobile.
Around 3,000 people have climbed to the Everest summit since Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to conquer the peak in 1953. 
 Question:According to Lars Nyberg, the 3G services they provide   _  . 
A. are fast and convenient 
B. are a little expensive 
C. can make voice-only calls 
D. offer free emailing 
 Answer: A
Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees 
 Answer: C
Context: Concern with money, and then more money, in order to buy the conveniences and luxuries of modern life, has brought great changes to the lives of most Frenchmen. More people are working harder than ever before in France. In the cities the traditional leisurely midday meal is disappearing. Offices, shops, and factories are discovering the great efficiency of a short lunch hour in company lunch rooms. In almost all lines of work emphasis now falls on ever increasing output. Thus the ""typical"" Frenchman produces more, earns more, and buys more consumer goods than his counterpart of only a generation ago. He gains in creature comfort and ease of life. What he loses to some extent is his sense of personal uniqueness, or individuality.
Some say that France has been Americanized. This is because the United States is a world symbol of the technological society and its consumer products. The so called Americanization of France has its critics. They fear that ""assembly line life"" will lead to the disappearance of the pleasures of the more graceful and leisurely (but less productive) old French style. What will happen, they ask, to taste, elegance, and the cultivation of the good things in life to joy in the smell of a freshly picked apple, a stroll by the river, or just happy hours of conversation in a local cafe?
Since the late 1950s life in France has indeed taken on qualities of rush, tension, and the pursuit of material gain. Some of the strongest critics of the new way of life are the young, especially university students. They are concerned with the future, and they fear that France is threatened by the triumph of this competitive, goods-oriented culture. Occasionally, they have reacted against the trend with considerable violence.
In spite of the critics, however, countless Frenchmen are committed to keeping France in the forefront of the modern economic world. They find that the present life brings more rewards, conveniences, and pleasures than that of the past. They believe that a modern, industrial France is preferable to the old. 
 Question:The passage suggests that   _  . 
A. in pursuing material gains the French are suffering losses elsewhere 
B. it's now unlikely to see a Frenchman enjoying a stroll by the river 
C. the French are fed up with the smell of freshly picked apples 
D. great changes have occurred in the life style of all Frenchmen 
 Answer: A
Context: Infiniti, Nissan's luxury brand, continues to show off ideas for the future.
The Q80 Inspiration here in Paris is an excellent piece of work, perhaps a concept elegant enough to make us forget that Infiniti's former Hong Kong-based president, Johan de Nysschen, moved to take over General Motors' Cadillac car brand in July and Infiniti chairman Andy Palmer is the new CEO at Aston Martin, the British luxury car brand.
The Q80, if it becomes reality, will be brought to market by Infiniti's new boss, former BMW (another famous car brand )executive Roland Kruger. He should focus on this, at least until he is head-hunted to another company.
The Q80 Inspiration is a low and sexy four-door fastback, and it is also a showcase for technology - from autonomous driving to eco-friendly power trains. Here in Paris, the Infiniti people say the hybrid drive in this concept suggest exactly where the brand is going in the future.
The company says the Q80 speaks to how Infiniti plans to pull people into more expensive cars - cars that compete with the Porsche Panamera, for instance.
Alfonso Albaisa, Infiniti Executive Design Director, said the car ""delivers feminine elegance and muscular menace in equal measure and strikes big in terms of styling, craftsmanship, choice of materials and attention to detail.""
Most importantly, for luxury cars buyers who are increasingly puzzled by all the technology, the designers focused on making things simple.
""There is a tendency with modern design that every time you add interior features and technology you add complexity,"" said Albaisa, pointing to the concept's easy-to -understand -and -operate infotainment interface.
As for power, the Q80 Inspiration gets 550 horsepower from a twin turbocharged 3.0-litre V-6 combined with a hybrid electric power train. Fuel economy could be as good as 5.5 litres/100 km. 
 Question:In the future Infiniti will pay more attention to   _  . 
A. details 
B. craftsmanship 
C. energy conservation 
D. materials

Context: Four strange scholarships that actually exist
The scholarship for the tall
If you find yourself having to lower your head to enter doorways then you might get this unusual scholarship. If you are a boy 6'2"" or taller, or a girl 5'10"" or taller, then you can be in the running for the Tall Clubs International Scholarship. All you have to do is write a simple message titled ""What being tall means to me,"" and you could get $1,000.
The scholarship for the fat
This unusual scholarship is made available to New England high school seniors who are single, overweight, and have maintain  at least a 2.5 GPA. Every year two people are awarded the $500 prize. It's kind of like saying being fat and unpopular is not that bad after all.
The scholarship for the short
If you aren't tall enough for the tall scholarship, maybe you are short enough for the short one. The Billy Party Foundation offers this unusual scholarship to students who are short. One needs to be shorter then 4'10"" and have a medical certificate as proof of

 Answer: D
Context: We are going to talk again this week about higher education for disabled students who want to study in the United States.As we noted last time,there are no special colleges or universities for blind students.But there are for deaf students.One of them is Gallaudet University in Washington,D.C. Gallaudet is said to be the world's only liberal arts university where everything is designed for deaf or hard-of-hearing students.About 2,000 students attend Gallaudet.The cost for international students is about 33,000 dollars a year.
Financial aid is available in the form of scholarships,but only after the first year of studies. Most scholarship aid goes to students in financial need who do well in their first year.One scholarship for international students is for deaf students from developing countries.Another is just for students from China.The university also offers an English Language Institute.But Gallaudet says this program does not guarantee  acceptance to the university.
In the past year,students at Gallaudet protested against the administration's choice of a new president for the university.The protests led to the choice of a different president who is more popular with the students,Robert Davila.He is a former officer of the National Technical Institute for the Deaf.This technical college is in Rochester, New York.  It is one of the eight colleges in the Rochester Institute of Technology.
More than one thousand students attend the National Technical Institute for the Deaf. About one hundred of them are international students.They come from Africa, Asia,Europe and South America.
The cost is about 28,000 dollars a year for an international Technical Institute student.Foreign graduate students pay about 20,000 dollars.  Both undergraduate and graduate student can receive limited financial aid. They can also take part in the student employment program.This program makes it possible for students to work at the school. 
 Question:To those who study in Gallaudet,   _    . 
A. foreign students can earn more 
B. the costs are different 
C. receiving financial aid is easy 
D. every student can find a suitable job 
 Answer: B
Context: Hungry for the brightest students, many of the country's stronger universities are actively discounting tuition  .And it's the high achievers, rather than the needy students, who are getting a good chunk of the money.The practice is remarkably widespread, reaching almost all but the 30 or so Ivy and other top colleges that forbid good grades-based financial aid.Schools are also becoming more aggressive in raising their discounts.At the DePauw University Website, enter an SAT or ACT score, grade point average and class rank, and a computer program immediately tells you what kind of ""award"".Only ""the real unlucky"" pay full price any more.
About 76% of first-year students got some form of discount this year at 331 private schools.Average award per student: $7,000.At small schools with tuition under about $20,000, the average discount is even higher, with some schools returning over half their tuition.
Carnegie Mellon even tells students it will ""negotiate "" and perhaps match financial-aid packages if kids are offered bigger awards at other schools.Much as banks and insurers offer special rates to their best customers, schools are giving the biggest breaks to their top students.Public four-year colleges, too, are offering discounts.
The flip side of big discounts is that less money is available to improve academic programs and keep school infrastructure   up to date.Universities that have sharply increased their tuition discount rates have seen graduation rates fall, and that's true even among highly selective schools.They get the students in the door, but don't have the services to keep them. 
 Question:This passage mainly talks about   _  . 
A. the great benefit of offering lower tuition 
B. college tuition discounts in popularity 
C. the top students in need of tuition discounts 
D. reducing graduation rates due to big discounts 
 Answer: B
Context: Colleges taking another look at value of merit-based aid
Good grades and high tests scores still matter--a lot--to many colleges as they award financial aid.
But with low-income students projected to make up an ever-larger share of the college-bound population in coming years, some schools are re-examining whether that aid, typically known as ""merit aid"", is the most effective use of precious institutional dollars.
George Washington University in Washington, D.C., for example, said last week that it would cut the value of its average merit scholarships by about one-third and reduce the number of recipients , pouring the savings, about $2.5 million, into need-based aid. Allegheny College in Meadville, Pa., made a similar decision three years ago.
Now, Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., says it will phase out merit scholarships altogether. No current merit-aid recipients will lose their scholarships, but need-based aid alone will be awarded beginning with students entering in fall 2008.
Not all colleges offer merit aid; generally, the more selective a school, the less likely it is to do so. Harvard and Princeton, for example, offer generous need-based packages, but many families who don't meet need eligibility have been willing to pay whatever they must for a big-name school.
For small regional colleges that struggle just to fill seats, merit aid can be an important revenue-builder because many recipients still pay enough tuition dollars over and above the scholarship amount to keep the institution running.
But for rankings-conscious schools in between, merit aid has served primarily as a tool to recruit top students and to improve their academic profits. ""They're trying to buy students,"" says Skidmore College economist Sandy Baum.
Studies show merit aid also tends to benefit disproportionately students who could afford to enroll without it.
""As we look to the future, we see a more pressing need to invest in need-based aid,"" says Monica Inzer, dean of admission and financial aid at Hamilton, which has offered merit scholarships for 10 years. During that time, it rose in US News & World Report's ranking of the best liberal arts colleges, from 25 to 17.
Merit aid, which benefited about 75 students a year, or about 4% of its student body, at a cost of about $ 1 million a year, ""served us well,"" Inzer says, but ""to be discounting the price for families that don't need financial aid doesn't feel right any more.""
Need-based aid remains by far the largest share of all student aid, which includes state, federal and institutional grants. But merit aid, offered primarily by schools and states, is growing faster, both overall and at the institutional level.
Between 1995-96 and 2003-04, institutional merit aid alone increased 212%, compared with 47% for need-based grants. At least 15 states also offer merit aid, typically in a bid to enroll top students in the state's public institutions.
But in recent years, a growing chorus of critics has begun pressuring schools to drop the practice. Recent decisions by Hamilton and others may be ""a sign that people are starting to realize that there's this destructive competition going on,"" says Baum, co-author of a recent College Report that raises concerns about the role of institutional aid not based on need.
David Laird, president of the Minnesota Private College Council, says many of his schools would like to reduce their merit aid but fear that in doing so, they would lose top students to their competitors.
""No one can take one-sided action,"" says Laird, who is exploring whether to seek an exemption from federal anti-trust laws so member colleges can discuss how they could jointly reduce merit aid, ""This is a merry-go-round that's going very fast, and none of the institutions believe they can sustain the risks of trying to break away by themselves.""
A complicating factor is that merit aid has become so popular with middle-income families, who don't qualify for need-based aid, that many have come to depend on it. And, as tuitions continue to increase, the line between merit and need blurs.
That's one reason Allegheny College doesn't plan to drop merit aid entirely.
""We still believe in rewarding superior achievements and know that these top students truly value the scholarship,"" says Scott Friedhoff, Allegheny's vice president for enrollment.
Emory University in Atlanta, which boasts a $4.7 billion endowment , meanwhile, is taking another approach. This year, it announced it would eliminate loans for needy students and cap them for middle-income families. At the same time, it would expand its 28-year-old merit program.
""Yeah, we're playing the merit game,"" acknowledges Tom Lancaster, associate dean for undergraduate education. But it has its strong point, too, he says. ""The fact of the matter is, it's not just about the lowest-income people. It's the average American middle-class family who's being priced out of the market.""
A few words about merit-based aid:
Merit-based aid is aid offered to students who achieve excellence in a given area, and is generally known as academic, athletic and artistic merit scholarships.
Academic merit scholarships are based on students' grades, GPA and overall academic performance during high school. They are typically meant for students going straight to college right after high school. However, there are scholarships for current college students with exceptional grades as well. These merit scholarships usually help students pay tuition bills, and they can be renewed each year as long as the recipients continue to qualify. In some cases, students may need to be recommended by their school or a teacher as part of the qualification process.

Context: John McCain and Barack Obama call for closer U.S.-Chinese cooperation on trade, the environment and nuclear proliferation  in the upcoming issue of an American business group's magazine. They do so in an unusual effort to  _ voters abroad.
Both articles appeared Sunday on the website of the American Chamber of Commerce  in China, and will be published in China Brief, the chamber's monthly magazine, on September 22.
Both stress that the countries should work more closely to ease trade friction , fight global warming, improve military exchanges, and block the spread of nuclear weapons to such countries as Iran and North Korea. 
""Cooperation on the key, enduring global challenges, such as climate change, can deepen understanding and enhance confidence. """"We also need to deepen high-level dialogues on a sustained basis on economic, security and global political issues"", said Obama in the article.
McCain agreed that the cooperation with prefix = st1 /Chinawould be essential in addressing issues of global concern. ""TheUnited Statesshares common interests withChinathat can form the basis of a strong partnership on issues of global concern, including climate change, trade and proliferation,"" he added. ""and I hope to see our relationship develop in a manner that benefits both countries and, in turn, the Asia-Pacific region and the world,"" he noted.
Both candidates  were impressed by China's economic success.
""Chinahas achieved extraordinary, sustained growth over the past three decades. Hundreds of millions of people inChinalive better now than most thought possible even two decades ago,"" Obama said.
""China's double-digit growth rates have brought hundreds of millions out of poverty, energized the economies of its neighbors and produced many new economic opportunities,"" McCain said.
Gao Wenhuan, 21st Century Online's special reporter, interviewed Marshall M. Bouton, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. ""My guess is, regardless of who is elected in November, you will hear basically the same description that Chinais a strategic partner and competitor,"" said Bouton.
A survey conducted by the Council in July 2008 found that the majority of respondents clearly admired China's accomplishments, but some Americans viewedChina's rising global power as a threat. According to the survey,Chinanow is seen as the most influential country in the world following theU.S..

Context: BELT FAJAR, West Bank - of Khalil Taqataqah's nine children, 20-year-old Andaleeb was his favorite. She was up early on Friday, made him tea and then slipped unnoticed out of the modest family home in this West Bank village.
       In centralprefix = st1 /Jerusalemlater in the day, Andaleeb ended her life the way dozens of other Palestinians did before: She blew herself up, killing herself and six Israelis and injured scores more.
       Andaleeb's parents, sisters, best friends and close  s painted a picture of a quiet and soft-spoken woman who had not given a hint of her intentions.
       But Andaleeb spoke of her plan in a video taken before Friday's bombing and shown on Saturday on the Qatar-based Arab satellite TV channel AI-Jazeera.
       ""I've chosen to say with my body what Arab's leaders have failed to say."" Said Andaleeb, repeating a frequent complaint by Palestinians that Arab nations are not doing enough againstIsrael.
       ""My body is a barrel of gunpowder that burns the enemy."" she said, reading from a piece of paper.
       ""She was like any other girl of her age. She spoke about love and marriage. I am so sad she's gone. It's the shock of my life."" said her best friend and coworker Laila Mahmoud.
       A school dropout, Andaleeb had supported her family from a job at a Palestinian-owned textile factory in the nearby town ofBelt Jala. She had not reported for work for nearly three weeks because of repeated closures of West Bank roads by the Israeli army, according to her  s.
       ""Anyone in her place would have been out of control. It's her destiny and it's a source of pride and glory for us that she did what she could."" said her aunt, Jameela Taqataqah as she held back tears.
       Andaleeb, the third Palestinian woman to commit a suicide murder this year, wore blue jeans and a matching checkered shirt when she had a photograph taken two months ago.
       Andaleeb, her parents' fourth child, looked more than 20 in the photograph.
       Andaleeb's parents said they learned of their daughter's death early this morning when Israeli troops arrived and asked everyone to step out while they searched the house.
       ""They arrested one of her brothers and a male cousin who lives next door."" said the parents. 
 Question:All the following are true EXCEPT that   _  . 
A. Andaleeb was a student before she died

Context: TOKYO-- At first glance, Japanese cellphones are young people's favorites, with elegant design and quick access to the Internet. However, despite years of competition in overseas markets, Japan's cellphone makers have little presence beyond the country's shores.
The only Japanese cellphone maker with any meaningful global share is Sony Ericsson, and that company is a London-based joint venture between a Japanese electronics maker and a Swedish telecommunications firm.
And Sony Ericsson has been hit by big losses. Its market share was just 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009, behind Nokia of Finland, Samsung Electronics and LG of South Korea, and Motorola of Illinois.
This year, Mr Natsuno, who developed a popular wireless Internet service called i-Mode, invited some of the best minds in the field to debate how Japanese cellphones could go global.
""The most amazing thing about Japan is that even the average person out there will have a very advanced phone, ""said Mr Natsuno. Japan has 100 million users of advanced third-generation smart phones, twice the number of the United States, a much larger market. Many Japanese rely on their phones, not a PC, for Internet access.
Indeed, Japanese cellphone makers thought they had positioned themselves to dominate the age of digital data. But they were a little too clever. In the 1990s, they set a standard for the second-generation network that was refused everywhere else. Then Japan quickly adopted a third-generation standard in 2001. However, it made Japanese phones too advanced for most markets.
Several Japanese companies are now considering a push into overseas markets, including NEC. Panasonic, Sharp, Toshiba and Fujitsu are said to be planning similar moves.
""Japanese cellphone makers need to either look overseas, or exit the business"", said Kenshi Tazaki, a managing vice president at the consulting firm Gartner Japan. 
 Question:Which of the following would be the best title for the passage? 
A. Japanese cellphone companies are unsuccessful. 
B. Japan has more cellphone users than the US. 
C. Japanese cellphone industry intends to expand overseas markets. 
D. Going global--a difficult task for Japanese companies. 
 Answer: C
Context: As long as you have broadband  service in your home, you can turn on your desktop computer and connect to the Internet. If you have a wireless router , a device that spreads the broadband connection to other devices, you can set up a Wi-Fi network, which enables your cellphones and tablets go online too. And when you are outdoors where is no Wi-Fi, such as in the park or at the beach, having 3G service allows you to stay connected.
It seems that lots of us have Internet coverage everywhere we go. So why have mobile companies around the world lately been so enthusiastic about a new term, ""4G""? First, you need to know that the letter :G"" stands for ""generation"". Even if you have no idea what 4G is, at least you can figure out that it is a step up from 3G since it's the latest generation of mobile internet service.
Unlike broadband, mobile Internet uses the same signal towers that provide voice service to your cellphone, which means wherever you can make phone calls with your cellphone you also have an Internet connection.
But mobile connections have their _ : they don't carry as much information as broadband does, making opening websites and downloading music slower than they are on a Wi-Fi connection. This is why mobile connections have been constantly upgraded since the first generation was launched back in the 1980s.
According to BBC, 4G is five to seven times faster than current 3G network speeds, almost as fast as home broadband. Because of this, 4G is widely suited for services like video downloading, mapping, online shopping and even video conferencing.
To achieve the high speeds, network companies have to spend a lot of money on building new signal towers, which will eventually lead to a higher phone bill if you switch to 4G, and you will also have to get a new phone with 4G capacity. 
 Question:What is the weakness of 3G compared with 4G? 
A. Its voice is not as clear as 4G 
B. It can't satisfy the users' basic needs. 
C. Its network speeds are much slower. 
D. It has much less popularity than 4G. 
 Answer: C
Context: ""Any time! Any where! Decades ago there was no such thing"" - ""Communication"".
Then, September 7th 1987, the global system for mobile communication or GSM was born. And international agreements that laid out the standards, regulations and practices gave rise to a global mobile phone industry.
To be honest, the world's first mobiles were not so attractive and the range of effectiveness wasn't very good. But they became a must-have among those wealthy people who could afford that. However, by advantage of GSM which has many different elements to it, we can all enjoy the ability to go around the world in 217 countries, land in that country and know that a phone would work.
There are other cell phone systems using different technology in the world. The majority of the United States and parts of South America have been using something called CDMA which is very rare in Europe. In some Asian countries like China, GSM and CDMA both exist at the same time. But the GSM Association claims 85% of the global mobile phone market. They estimated there are now about 2.5 billion different users who make more than 7 trillion minutes of calls everyday, and that's not all.
20 years later, the mobile phone is so much more than just a phone. You can use it to send text messages, take pictures, show video, even surf the internet.
""The phone itself is involved from just being a communication tool, to be a tool for round-the-clock connectivity, you can not live without it even in a minute."" Mobile consultant Nick Lane also points out with so many customized styles and features, your mobile phone will become a symbol of you.
Where will the global mobile phone industry be in another 20 years? Certainly, there will be more connections than better coverage. As for where else technology will take us, one can only imagine. 
 Question:From this passage, we can infer that   _  . 
A. as soon as the first mobiles appeared, they became popular and many people have one 
B. with a GSM mobile phone, you can make a phone call in most parts of the USA 
C. there are only two cell phone systems in the whole world: GSM and CDMA 
D. most of the mobile phone users in the world now are using the GSM mobile phone 
 Answer: D
Context: Thirdgeneration mobile phones, known as 3G, are the next big step for the telecom industry. Data speed in 3G networks is much quicker than present technology. This means users can have highspeed Internet access and enjoy video and CDquality music on their phones.
 ""Mobile data is not a dream; it's not an option but a requirement."" said Len Lauer, head of a US communications company,Sprint PCS,at a 3G conference in Bangkok earlier this month.
With 3G, you can forget about text messages telling you yesterday's news; a 3G phone can receive video news programs, updated four times a day. Internet access will also be much quicker, making it easier to surf the Web on your phone than on your computer at home.
Facetoface video calls
And don't worry about getting lost. 3G phones offer map services so you can find a new restaurant just by pressing a few keys on your handset.
However, the most impressive part of 3G technology is video calling. With live twoday video communication, you can have facetoface talks with friends and family on your mobile phone.
Many European countries have already launched the service. In May 2000 the US Government issued five licenses to run 3G wireless services, while the first 3G phones arrived in Italy in March this year.
International telecom companies can't wait to sell 3G in China, the world's largest mobile telecommunications market. But they will have to be patient. At the moment, China is busy testing its 3Gbased technologies, networks and services. This will be followed by a trial period before the phones can finally hit the shops.
""We need to create a pool of 3G customers before the largescale commercial launch of the service."" said Fan Yunjun, marketing manager for Beijing Mobile. ""We expect that the 3G licenses will be issued late next year. "" 
 Question:According to the text, which function of the following makes 3G technology most extraordinary? 
A. It can provide video news programs, updated four times a day. 
B. Users can have facetoface talks with friends and family on their mobile phones. 
C. Users can enjoy video and CDquality music on their phones. 
D. It'll be easier for users to surf the Web on their phone than on their computers at home.

Context: A new report says only about half of all students in the main school systems of America's largest cities finish high school. The report notes higher rates of graduation -- over 70% --in areas surrounding the cities. Researchers studied high school graduation rates from the 2003, 2004 school year. They also identified the nation's fifty largest cities. The largest, New York City, had a population of more than eight million. The smallest city was Wichita, Kansas. It had about three hundred and sixty thousand people.
Researchers used a system of measurement called the cumulative promotion index to find graduation rates. School officials in many of the cities studied said the resulting numbers were too low. That is because different areas use different methods to find graduation rates. Critics say many methods do not give a true _ of the number of students who leave high school before finishing.
Other studies have put the national graduation rate at about 70%. But experts agree that too many students are not completing high school. They estimate the number at more than one million each year. The report was prepared for America's Promise Alliance. The private group aims to help children receive services they need to succeed.
General Colin Powell was chairman of America's Promise Alliance when it was formed in 1997. He attended the press conference Tuesday where the report was released. He said studies have shown that the US must do more to educate the leaders and work force of the future.
Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings also spoke. She said the government will propose that states use the same methods when reporting graduation rates. Alliance officials also announced the start of a nationwide campaign to improve graduation rates. It is to include a series of meetings to be held in every state over the next two years. The meetings will bring together elected leaders, business owners, students, parents and education officials. They will develop plans to increase the number of Americans who finish high school. 
 Question:The author wants to tell us   _  .

B. different methods to find graduation rates 
C. services American children need to receive 
D. the increase of the number of Americans who finish their high school

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture

Context: Sixteen-year-old Karlos Dearman's future is looking much brighter than he might previously have imagined. ""I love bikes, but I've never thought I'd end up with working with them,"" he says. ""This program has changed my life.""
Karlos is learning to refurbish   old bicycles in the workshop   of ReCycle Bikes, an independent non-profit bike project in Sheffield. It provides training chances for young people aged 14 to 16 with the help of the local government, particularly those struggling in mainstream education or rejected from school.
""It's about engaging young people with education and youth training by teaching them work and life skills,"" explains Des Pearce, workshop training manager. ""These young people have so much potential, but often don't realize it.""
Founded in 2001, ReCycle Bikes repairs bicycles donated by the public, which are sold for PS20 after refurbished. Abandoned bikes supplied by the government make sure a steady flow of bikes, but a recently formed partnership with Sheffield University should improve the further development.
""The student population presents a large and ready market,"" says Pearce. ""So we approached the university last year and offered to host bike sales on the campus   . They thought it was a great idea, and agreed to provide us with more support. This means we can train young people to repair extra 500 bikes over three years.""
Having set up ReCycle Bikes on his own, Pearce now has the staff and resources to track the profession development of those who have passed through his workshop. ""But we are planning exit interviews with the young people to make sure what they plan to do, and these will allow us to check on their progress,"" says Pearce.
That most of the teenagers enjoy the work is, according to Pearce, easily explained. ""Most kids have ridden a bike and know how to oil a chain or mend a flat tyre. As low-cost transport, cycling gives the young and old a sense of freedom and independence, and the effect on their well-being is big. Add to that a growing concern for the environment, and it's no surprise that bike sales are on the increase."" 
 Question:From the passage, we know ReCycle Bikes   _  . 
A. is a popular brand of bikes 
B. provides training chances for young people 
C. is a training project offered by the government 
D. aims at making money by selling refurbished bicycles

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns.

A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government.

Context: When Denis Hennequin took over as the European boss of McDonald's in January 2004, the world's biggest restaurant chain was showing signs of recovery in America and Australia, but sales in Europe were sluggish or declining.One exception was France, where Mr.Hennequin had done a reliable job as head on the group's French subsidiary  to sell more Big Macs to his relatives, His task was to copy this success in all 41 of the European countries where anti-globalisers' favourite enemy operates.
So far Mr.Henncquin is doing well.Last year European sales increased by 5.8% and the number of customers by 3.4%, the best annual results in nearly 15 years.Europe accounted for 36% of the group's profits and for 28 of its sales.December was an especially good month as customers took to seasonal menu offerings in France and Britain, and to a promotion in Germany based on the game of Monopoly .
Mr.Hennequin's recipe for revival  is to be more open about his company's operations, to be ""locally relevant"", and to improve the experience of visiting his 6.400 restaurants. McDonaId's is blamed for making people fat, exploiting workers, treating animals cruelly, polluting the environment and simply for being American.Mr.Hennequin says he wants to engage in a dialogue with the public to address these concerns.
He introduced ""open door"" visitor days in each country which became hugely popular.In Poland alone some 50,000 visitors came to McDonaId's through the visitors' program last year.The Nutrition Information Initiative launched last year, put detailed Sables on McDonaId's packaging with data on calories, protein, fat, carbohy drates and salt content, ""the details are also printed on tray-liners. 
 Question:What did Denis Hennequin do to increase the sales of McDonald in Europe? 
A. He visited all the McDonaId's branches in Europe. 
B. He introduced ""open door"" visitor's days in each country. 
C. He had done a reliable job as head of the group's French subsidiary. 
D. He engaged in a dialogue with the public.

Context: On March 5, 2009, Michael Jackson stood in front of crowds of fans. Before screaming fans, he pronounced with pumping arms: ""This is it!""
A few months later, Jackson was dead. With the late pop star's return to radio, television and the cultural events, Forbes judges that Jackson has made $90 million since his death June 25. This figure is based on his royalties  from album sales, radio play, rights to his name and royalties from his stock in the Sony/ATV music catalog  .
Jackson's music was his most easily-seen source in the last months. ""Nothing increases the value of an artist than death ... an untimely death,"" says Barry Massarsky, a music industry economist.
The music's immediate value was clear. Since June, Jackson has sold more than 5.9 million albums in the U.S. and another 4.5 million overseas. In the first weeks after his death, there were 5.6 million single downloads across North America, Europe and Australia. Jackson recently has three of the top 20 best-selling albums of the year in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan. His 2003 hits album Number Ones is the best seller of the year, beating Taylor Swift's Fearless.
More than 500,000 Jackson ringtones and 100,000 music videos were sold. In the week following his death, songs by The Jackson 5, The Jacksons and Michael were played over 100,000 times on the radio, according to Nielsen BDS.
Jackson's estate will likely see more money by the end of this year, as it has rights to some of the profits from This Is It as well as the two-disc album of the same name. The estate will share 90% of the film profits with AEG.
Ticket sales from an exhibit opening in London will also contribute a likely profit. Hundreds of Jackson's personal belongings-his L.A. Rolls Royce etc-will remain on show for three months at the O2 for fans willing to shell out $25 for a view.
The pop singer bought ATV Publishing, for $47.5 million in 1985. Ten years later, he sold the catalog to Sony for $95 million and took a 50% stock in Sony/ATV, which is now worth about $1.7 to $2 billion. So he still owned half the Sony/ATV catalog at his death.
Jackson's future earning potential is based on his stock in valuable music and as well as the value of his image . As many musicians, actors and artists before him, Jackson's fame could have a long tail on the market with allowable products, advertising and entertainment events. 
 Question:All the following is true EXCEPT that   _  . 
A. Rolls Royce is now for show and will finally be sold 
B. Jackson has sold 10.4 million albums since June 
C. Jackson's L. 
D. Jackson's stock in music and his image will keep on earning money in the future

Context: Recently a Beijing father sent in a question at an Interact forum asking what ""PK"" meant.
""My family has been watching the 'Super Girl' singing competition TV program.My little daughter asked me what 'PK' meant,but I had no idea,""explained the puzzled father.
To a lot of Chinese young people who have been playing games online,it is impossible not to know this term.In such Internet games,""PK"" is short for ""Player Kill"",in which two players fight until one ends the life of the other.
In the case of the ""Super Girl"" singing competition.""PK"" was used to refer to the stage where two singers have to compete with each other for only one chance to go up in competition ranking.
Like this father,Chinese teachers at high schools have also been finding their students' compositions using Internet
which are difficult to understand.A high school teacher from Tianjin asked her students to write compositions with simple language,but they came up with a lot of Internet jargons that she didn't understand.
""My 'GG' came back this summer from college.He told me I've grown up to be a 'PLMM'.I loved to 'FB' with him together;he always took me to the 'KPM',""went one composition.
""GG"" means Ge Ge(Chinese pinyin for brother).""PLMM"" refers to Piao Liang Mei Mei (beautiful girl).""FB"" means Fu Bai (corruption).""KPM"" is short for KFC.Pizza Hut and McDonald's.
Some specialists welcome Internet jargons as a new development in language.

Context: Sparrow is a fast-food chain with 200 restaurants. Some years ago, the group to which Sparrow belonged was taken over by another company. Although Sparrow showed no sign of declining, the chain was generally in an unhealthy state. With more and more fast-food concepts reaching the market, the Sparrow menu had to struggle for attention. And to make matters worse, its new owner had no plans to give it the funds it required.
Sparrow failed to grow for another two years. Until a new CEO, Carl Pearson, decided to build up its market share. He did a survey, which showed that consumers who already used Sparrow restaurants were extremely positive about the chain, while customers of other fast-food chains were unwilling to turn away from them. Sparrow had to develop a new promotional campaign.
Pearson faced a battle over the future of the Sparrow brand. The chain's owner now favored rebranding Sparrow as Marcy's restaurants. Pearson resisted, arguing for an advertising campaign designed to convince customers that visits to Sparrow restaurants were fun. Such an attempt to establish a positive relationship between a company and the general public was unusual for that time. Pearson strongly believed that numbers were the key to success, rather than customers' speeding power. Finally, the owner accepted his idea.
The campaign itself changed the traditional advertising style of the fast-food industry. The TV ads of Sparrow focused on entertainment and featured original songs performed by a variety of stars. Instead of showing the superiority of a specific product, the intention was to put Sparrow in the hearts of potential customers.
Pearson also made other decisions which he believed would contribute to the new Sparrow image. For example, he offered to lower the rent of any restaurants which achieved a certain increase in their turnover   .
These efforts paid off, and Sparrow soon became one of the most successful fast-food chains in the regions where it operated. 
 Question:What was Pearson's achievement as a CEO? 
A. He managed to pay off Sparrow's debts. 
B. He made Sparrow much more competitive 
C. He helped Sparrow take over a company 
D. He improved the welfare of Sparrow employees 
 Answer: B
Context: When you buy a T-shirt, or a fur coat in a store, it often carries a label telling who made it or from what store it was bought. Instead, some labels show the dress is famous and it is very expensive, so buyers secretly wish they could be carried forever. On the other hand, buyers who deal with the cheapest products would be pleased to be away with labels  _ .
However, there is another label more important than the one showing from which store the dress was bought. When a person buys a fur coat, or a jacket from a store, a label telling what the product is made of should be carried to it.
The label is required by law. Besides telling what the product on show is made of, the label should be in clear English and be where one can find it easily. The information on the label must be true.
The reason for this is that most buyers today aren't expert enough to know exactly what kind of fur or material they are buying. The buyers must believe in the store that sells the products or in what the label says. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE? 
A. A T-shirt seldom carries a label. 
B. A fur coat with a high price often carries a false label. 
C. A label only says what material the product is made of. 
D. Not all buyers know the materials they are buying.

Context: The Colonel asks Ashenden a good many questions and then suggested that he had particular qualifications for the Secret Service. Ashenden knew several European languages and the fact that he was a writer provided excellent cover: on the pretext that he was writing a book he could, without attracting attention, visit any neutral country.
   It was while they were discussing this point that the Colonel said, ""You know you might get material that would be very useful to you in your work. I'll tell you an incident that occurred only recently. Very dramatic. A foreign government minister went down to a Mediterranean resort to recover from a cold and he had some very important documents with him that he kept in a dispatch case . A day or two after he arrived, he picked up a beautiful blonde at some restaurant or other, and he got very friendly with her. He took her back to his hotel, and when he came to himself in the morning, the lady and the dispatch-case had disappeared. They had one or two drinks up in his room and his theory is that when his back was turned the woman slipped a drug in his glass.
   ""Do you mean to say that happened the other day?"" said Ashenden.
   ""The week before last.""
   ""Impossible,"" cried Ashenden. ""Why! We've been putting that incident on the stage for sixty years, we've written it in a thousand novels. Do you mean to say that life has only just caught up with us?""
   ""Well, I can guarantee the truth of the story."" said the Colonel, ""And believe me, the government has been put to no end of trouble by the loss of the documents.""
   ""Well sir, if you can't do better than that in the Secret Service,"" sighed Ashenden, "" I'm afraid that as a source of inspiration to the writer of fiction, it's washout."" 
 Question:Ashenden cried 'Impossible' after hearing the Colonel's story because he thought   _   . 
A. it could not possibly happen 
B. it was too embarrassing 
C. it was too close to fiction

Context: Consumers are being confused and misled by the hodge-podge  of environmental claims made by household products, according to a ""green labeling"" study published by Consumers International Friday.
Among the report's more unacceptalbe findings - a German fertilizer described itself as ""earthworm friendly""; a brand of flour said it was ""non-polluting"" and a British toilet paper claimed to be ""environmentally friendlier"".
The study was written and researched by Britain's National Consumer Council (NCC) for lobby group Consumers International. It was funded by the German and Dutch governments and the European Commission.
""While many good and useful claims are being made, it is clear that there is a long way to go in ensuring shoppers are adequately informed about the environmental impacts they buy,"" said Consumers International director, Anna Fielder.
The 10-country study surveyed product packaging in Britain, Western Europe, Scandinavia and the United States. It found that products sold in Germany and the United Kingdom made the most environmental claims on average.
The report focused on claims made by specific products, such as detergent  , insect sprays and some garden products. It did not test claims, but compared them to labeling guidelines set by the International Standards Organization (ISO) in September, 1999. Researchers documented claims of environmental friendliness made by about 2,000 products and found many too vague or too misleading to meet ISO standards.
""Many products had specially designed labels to make them seem environmentally friendly, but in fact many of these symbols mean nothing,"" said report researcher Philip Page.
""Laundry detergents made the most number of claims with 158. Household cleaners were second with 145 separate claims, while paints were third on our list with 73. The high numbers show how confusing it must be for consumers to sort the true from the misleading,"" he said.
The ISO labeling standards ban vague or misleading claims on product packaging, because terms such as ""environmentally friendly"" and ""non-polluting"" cannot be verified. ""What we are now pushing for is to have multinational corporations meet the standards set by the ISO,"" said Page. 
 Question:According to the passage, the NCC found it unacceptable that   _  . 
A. all the products surveyed claim to meet ISO standards 
B. the claims made by products are often unclear and deceiving 
C. consumers would believe many of the manufacturers' claims 
D. few products actually prove to be environment friendly 
 Answer: B
Context: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth.
An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, ""the worst came to the worst"". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door.
The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced.
Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank. He says the plant seeds would only be used when all other seeds are gone for some reason. Norwayfirst proposed the idea in the 1980s. But security concerns delayed the plan. At that time, the Soviet Union was meeting inRomeof the Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the above passage? 
A. The government of Norwaywill perform the project alone. 
B. Seeds to be collected there were produced ten thousands years ago. 
C. Spitsbergen is chosen because it is free of the threat unclear war forever. 
D. Temperature is a major consideration when choosing the storage place. 
 Answer: D
Context: Despite the anxiety that Jones'Host-said by some to be the first digital novel-caused in 1993,publishers weren't too concerned that e-books would one day replace printed books.However,that attitude was changed suddenly in 2007 when Amazon's Kindle came onto the market,which led to e-book sales jumping up to 1,260%.Since then,e-books'popularity has continued to steadily rise.The publishing industry seemed to have lost all possible ability to regain its position.Will printed books eventually become a thing of the past?
According to Mike Shatzkin,founder and CEO of the Idea Logical Company,printed books just for plain old reading will,in 10years from now,be unusual.""Not so unusual that a kid will say,'Mommy,what's that?'but unusual enough that on the train you'll see one or two people reading something printed,while everyone else is reading off of a tablet.""And Shatzkin believes that the demise of print is sure to happen,though such a day won't arrive for perhaps 50to 100or more years.
Robert Stein,founder of the Institute for the Future of the Book,however,believes that books won't disappear entirely,at least not anytime soon.""Print will exist,but it will be in a different field and will appeal to a very limited audience,as poetry does today.Like woodblock printing,hand-processed film and folk weaving  ,printed pages may assume an artistic value,""he says.He imagines that future forms of books might be developed not by conventional publishers but by the gaming industry.He also predicts that the distinction between writer and reader will be made less obvious by a social reading experience in which authors and consumers can digitally interact with each other to discuss any passage,sentence or line.
Is there anything we risk sacrificing,should print really disappear entirely?According to Maryanne Wolf,director of the Center for Reading and Language Research at Tufts University,electronic reading can negatively affect the way the brain responds to text,including reading comprehension,focus and the ability to maintain attention to details like plot and order of events.""My worry is that we'll have a short-circuited reading brain,excellent for gathering information but not necessarily for forming critical,analytical deep reading skills,""Wolf says.
The field,however,is in an early stage,and findings about the negative effects of e-reading are far from certain.In light of this,Wolf hopes that we continue to maintain a""bi-literate""society-one that values both the digital and printed word.""A full reading brain circuit is a huge contribution to the intellectual development of our species.Anything that threatens that deserves our attention.""

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns.

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----. 
A. planted less corn 
B. planted morn crops 
C. planted morn wheat

Context: As Apple tries to maintain its growth and success in China, the world's largest smart-phone market is becoming even more critical. Apple's shares  fell sharply as the company's earnings for the holiday quarter through December disappointed investors.
The sales of the iPhone, which include both the iPhone 5 and older models, came in at the low end of analysts' expectations, while the company's income plan for the second quarter was below analysts' forecasts, though Apple is known to give conservative   forecasts.
Som'6 analysts have said that for Apple to regain its growth, the company.needs a more aggressive strategy for markets, or more specifically for China, where the market for smart phones has been expanding more rapidly than anywhere else. In China, demand is particularly great for inexpensive phones that run on Android  operating system, sold by many Chinese phone makers as well as South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.
But Apple says it's already enjoying strong growth in China. ""We saw big growth in iPhones,""Chief Executive Tim Cook said. He said that the company has been quickly expanding its sales channels in China, including the number of Apple stores. ""This isn't nearly what we need, we're not even close to that, but we're making great progress. "" he said.
In China, a big missing piece for Apple is China Mobile Ltd. , the biggest local telecom carrier that doesn't yet sell the iPhone. Earlier this month, Mr. Cook met China Mobile Chairman Xi Guohua in Beijing and discussed cooperation, stirring hopes that the world's largest mobile carrier may soon start offering the iPhone.
Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is working on a lower-end iPhone that could launch as early as this year. But one possible challenge for Apple in China is that low-pricod Android-based phones are getting better in terms of quality. A report from CLSA in late November showed that many smart-phones sold at about 1,000 yuan ( $160) came with higher-reso-lution screens, better cameras and more powerful processors than phones at that price did a year earlier. 
 Question:What can we learn from the passage? 
A. Apple tends to offer a lower sales forecast. 
B. China Mobile Ltd began to team up with Apple. 
C. Cook is pessimistic about what Apple did in China. 
D. Apple didn't take measures to develop Chinese market.

Context: Eighth-grader Victoria Bills is talking about money with her classmates. She is worried that a company's stock   price could fall. It may be an unusual topic of conversation for a 13-year-old. But at Bills' school in Chicago, US, you hear it all the time.
The Chicago school's 420 students learn about economic . They also get a chance to make money. Each 1stgrade and 5thgrade, students learn the basics of economics and investing .
Then in 6thgrade, they put what they've learned to work. Students join a junior group that manages the $20,000. The group, made up of 12 to 14 students, decides which stocks to buy.
After graduating, students pass on $20,000 to the next 1stgrade class. They keep half of the rest of the money; the other half goes toward improving the school. They can choose to put their money in a college-savings program or take the cash.

Context: Is it time to kick Russia out of the BRICs  ? If so, it may end up sounding like a famous ball-point pen maker-BIC. An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device ,the BRICs, should really be the BICs.
""Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?"" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreigh Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of ""The Russian Balance Sheet"", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes:
""The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas. ""
Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing
far better than Russia.
But the BRICs are not just about economy. As is mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while around 80 percent is for the other three.
At very least, however, Russia's economic underperformance and stock market outperfoumance does suggest it is indeed one of the group. 
 Question:From the passage we know that   _  . 
A. Anders Aslund is working for the Russian government 
B. Russia outperfoumed the other three countries in stock market 
C. most people disagree Russia is included in BRICs 
D. the BRICs would end up being the BICs sooner or later

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B
Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government.

Context: Businesses are witnessing a difficult time,which has in turn produced influence on consumers' desire to go green.However,shoppers are still laying stress on environmental concerns.
Two thirds of customers say that environmental considerations _ their purchases to the same degree as they did a year ago,while more than a quarter say that they are now even better aware of the environmental effect on what they buy.
This may help to influence how shops store goods on their shelves.And the companies should still make efforts to become more environmentally friendly.Two out of three people think it is important to buy from environmentally responsible companies,with about one in seven saying that they had even decided to take their custom elsewhere if they felt a company's environmental reputation was not good enough.
Harry Morrison,chief executive of the Carbon Trust,sympathizes:""I understand this situation where survival is very important now.But from environmental considerations,the clock is ticking--we don't have much time.In addition,cutting carbon has an immediate effect as costs drop and a mediumterm benefit for the brand.""
Larger companies have an extra motivation to look at reducing their carbon footprint,as new rules next year will require businesses to buy carbon allowances to make up for their emissions .Those that have taken early action will have a head start.More than two thirds of consumers are not clear about which companies are environmentally responsible.This suggests that firms that are able to relay clearly their message to the public will be in a pole position to attract shoppers.
The Carbon Trust believes that it can help by informing customers about the good work companies are doing.""When companies are granted  the standard,they can use a logo  in all their marketing which makes it clear that they are working towards cutting emissions,"" Mr.Morrison said.

Context: The US will seek to expand its own oil production in an attempt to reduce dependence on imported oil and bring down fuel prices , President Obama says . New contracts for exploration will be signed in non-protected areas of Alaska and in the Gulf of Mexico.
In his weekly speech , the President insisted the US could reduce its need for imported oil and improve safety. Using his speech to tell Americans that he understood their concerns about rising prices, President Obama focused particularly on the price of fuel, which has risen in recent months.
US consumers have historically enjoyed cheap fuel , but have seen prices rise in recent months even though US oil production in 2010 reached its highest level for seven years.
Although the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 was serious, Mr Obama said the Gulf remained a key part of the country's future energy supply.
The President's proposals  come after Republicans   introduced a series of proposals that would expand and speed up oil and gas production.
The White House has criticized the Republican proposals for safety reasons , but Mr Obama was clear in his speech that he felt safety and environmental standards could be maintained even though production might rise.
"" I believe that we should continue to expand oil production in America --even as we increase safety and environmental standards ,""he said.
""As a nation, we should be investing in the clean, renewable sources of energy that are the solution to high gas prices.""
Mr Obama has previously called for a step-change in energy policy, saying the US must move towards getting 80%of its electricity from clean energy sources by 2035. 
 Question:What can we learn from the text ? 
A. The US has got most of its electricity from clean energy. 
B. US oil production is too small to keep the present low fuel prices. 
C. The US produced the most oil in 2010 in its history. 
D. The Gulf is still important in energy supply in spite of the oil spill in 2010.

Context: Climbers at the top of Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, will now be able to make video calls and surf the Internet on their mobile phones, a Nepalese   telecom group claims.
Ncell, a branch company of Swedish phone giant TeliaSonera, said on Thursday it had set up a high-speed third-generation (3G) phone base station at an altitude of 5,200 metres in the Everest region.
""Today we made the world's highest video call from Mount Everest base camp successfully. The coverage   of the network will reach up to the peak of Mount Everest,"" Ncell Nepal chief Pasi Koistinen told reporters in Kathmandu.
The installation   will also help tens of thousands of tourists and hikers who visit the world's highest mountain every year.
Climbers who reached its 8,848-metre peak previously depended on expensive satellite phones and a voice-only network set up by China Mobile in 2007 on the Chinese side of the mountain.
""This is a great milestone for mobile communications as the 3G high speed Internet will bring faster, more affordable telecommunication services from the world's tallest mountain,"" said Lars Nyberg, chief executive of TeliaSonera, which owns 80 percent of Ncell.
The 3G services will be fast enough to make video calls and use the Internet, said the company, which also claimed the world's lowest 3G base at 1,400 metres below sea level in a mine in Europe.
Despite the installation in Mount Everest, telecom services cover less than one-third of the 28 million people of Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world.
TeliaSonera said it planned to invest $ 100 million in the next year to ensure that mobile coverage increases to more than 90 per cent of the Himalayan nation's population.
The 3G network on Mount Everest puts TeliaSonera ahead of state-controlled Nepal Telecom, Indian-owned United Telecom and China Mobile.
Around 3,000 people have climbed to the Everest summit since Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to conquer the peak in 1953. 
 Question:According to Lars Nyberg, the 3G services they provide   _  . 
A. are fast and convenient 
B. are a little expensive 
C. can make voice-only calls 
D. offer free emailing 
 Answer: A
Context: The use of mobile phones over a long period of time can raise the risk for brain tumors , a new Swedish study said on Friday , contradicting (......) the conclusions of other researchers .
       The Dutch Health Council , in an overview of research from around the world , last year found no evidence radiation   from mobile phones and TV towers was harmful . A four-year British survey released in January showed no link between regular . long-term use of cell phones and the most common type of tumor .
       However , researchers at the Swedish National Institute for Working Life said they looked at the mobile phone use of 905 people between the age of 20 and 80 who had been diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor   and found a link 
       "" A total 80 of these 905 cases were so-called high users of mobile phones , that is they began early to use mobile and or wireless telephones and used them a lot , "" the study said .
       "" The study also shows that the rise in risk is noticeable for tumors on the sided of the head where the phone was said to be used , "" it added .
       Kjell Mild , who led the study , said the figures meant that heavy users of mobile phones , for instance of who make mobile phone calls for 2 , 000 hours or more in their life , had a 240 percent increased risk for a malignant tumor on the side of the head the phone is used .

Context: TOKYO-- At first glance, Japanese cellphones are young people's favorites, with elegant design and quick access to the Internet. However, despite years of competition in overseas markets, Japan's cellphone makers have little presence beyond the country's shores.
The only Japanese cellphone maker with any meaningful global share is Sony Ericsson, and that company is a London-based joint venture between a Japanese electronics maker and a Swedish telecommunications firm.
And Sony Ericsson has been hit by big losses. Its market share was just 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009, behind Nokia of Finland, Samsung Electronics and LG of South Korea, and Motorola of Illinois.
This year, Mr Natsuno, who developed a popular wireless Internet service called i-Mode, invited some of the best minds in the field to debate how Japanese cellphones could go global.
""The most amazing thing about Japan is that even the average person out there will have a very advanced phone, ""said Mr Natsuno. Japan has 100 million users of advanced third-generation smart phones, twice the number of the United States, a much larger market. Many Japanese rely on their phones, not a PC, for Internet access.
Indeed, Japanese cellphone makers thought they had positioned themselves to dominate the age of digital data. But they were a little too clever. In the 1990s, they set a standard for the second-generation network that was refused everywhere else. Then Japan quickly adopted a third-generation standard in 2001. However, it made Japanese phones too advanced for most markets.
Several Japanese companies are now considering a push into overseas markets, including NEC. Panasonic, Sharp, Toshiba and Fujitsu are said to be planning similar moves.
""Japanese cellphone makers need to either look overseas, or exit the business"", said Kenshi Tazaki, a managing vice president at the consulting firm Gartner Japan. 
 Question:Which of the following would be the best title for the passage? 
A. Japanese cellphone companies are unsuccessful. 
B. Japan has more cellphone users than the US. 
C. Japanese cellphone industry intends to expand overseas markets. 
D. Going global--a difficult task for Japanese companies. 
 Answer: C
Context: ""Any time! Any where! Decades ago there was no such thing"" - ""Communication"".
Then, September 7th 1987, the global system for mobile communication or GSM was born. And international agreements that laid out the standards, regulations and practices gave rise to a global mobile phone industry.
To be honest, the world's first mobiles were not so attractive and the range of effectiveness wasn't very good. But they became a must-have among those wealthy people who could afford that. However, by advantage of GSM which has many different elements to it, we can all enjoy the ability to go around the world in 217 countries, land in that country and know that a phone would work.
There are other cell phone systems using different technology in the world. The majority of the United States and parts of South America have been using something called CDMA which is very rare in Europe. In some Asian countries like China, GSM and CDMA both exist at the same time. But the GSM Association claims 85% of the global mobile phone market. They estimated there are now about 2.5 billion different users who make more than 7 trillion minutes of calls everyday, and that's not all.
20 years later, the mobile phone is so much more than just a phone. You can use it to send text messages, take pictures, show video, even surf the internet.
""The phone itself is involved from just being a communication tool, to be a tool for round-the-clock connectivity, you can not live without it even in a minute."" Mobile consultant Nick Lane also points out with so many customized styles and features, your mobile phone will become a symbol of you.
Where will the global mobile phone industry be in another 20 years? Certainly, there will be more connections than better coverage. As for where else technology will take us, one can only imagine. 
 Question:From this passage, we can infer that   _  . 
A. as soon as the first mobiles appeared, they became popular and many people have one 
B. with a GSM mobile phone, you can make a phone call in most parts of the USA 
C. there are only two cell phone systems in the whole world: GSM and CDMA 
D. most of the mobile phone users in the world now are using the GSM mobile phone

Context: By 2050, half of the world's population will live in the tropics--the  ly warm belt that circles the globe--according to State of the Tropics, a report released today. Rapid population growth, along with economic growth, means that the region's influence will grow in coming decades, the authors of the 500-page work predict.
The project, first launched in 2011, aimed to answer one significant question: Is life in the tropics improving? To find out, the researchers analyzed environmental, social, and economic indicators collected over 6 decades. It finds that the region has made ""extraordinary progress"" in many areas. For example, more people have access to safe drinking water, and the number of protected areas is increasing. The tropics also have outperformed the rest of the world in economic growth over the past 30 years.
However, some challenges remain. Investment in research and development, for example, has increased cautiously, but tropical nations still invest less than the rest of the world. ""As a proportion of GDP the Rest of the World invests almost four times as much in research and development than the Tropics."" concludes the report.
The report also includes a new analysis of how climate change will affect the region. Many plant and animal species are moving poleward in an attempt to stay within their preferred environmental conditions in the tropics, the authors write. However, some organisms may not be able to keep pace with the changing conditions, they predict. As a result, they can experience population declines or go extinct.
In addition, an expanded tropical zone also threatens health and safety issues, the authors warn. As regions become more suitable to insects such as mosquitoes and ticks, the spread of insect-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, and Lyme disease could rise, causing a burden to human health and the economy. 
Bruna, a researcher, says he sees a lot to be concerned about in the report. ""While we've made incredible advances in some areas, I think the risks for the tropics that are highlighted in this report are things that we really need to be concerned about.""

B. Optimistic.

D. Subjective. 
 Answer: C
Context: Not long ago, people could only buy organic food in small shops. Today it is common in most major supermarkets. The reason for the increase is that more and more people are demanding food grown without chemicals. Since the 1990s, organic farm production has gone up 20 percent every year. This pattern is expected to continue around the globe.
Australia leads the world in land used for organic agriculture. It has four times as much land devoted to organic farming as all of Asia. However, most of the land is not very fertile, and it only produces a modest amount of food. Argentina is a distant second, followed by Brazil, the United States and China. In Africa, only a very small amount of land is registered for organic farming. That does not mean Africa relies on chemicals. In fact, many farmers do not use chemicals because they cannot afford them. Yet there are no programs for these farmers to prove they do not use chemicals. Without these programs their food can never be approved organic.
India has had the most dramatic recent increase in organic farming. Like many other countries, India sees continual growth in organic food sales around the world. This, of course, leads to growth in profits. Sales of organic food were more than doubled from 2000 to 2005. Like India, many countries are trying to increase commercial organic farming to get a share of the sales. This has led to criticism. Some people believe that organic farming should not just be about making money. They think the goal is to help the environment. Others say organic farming will not continue if it is not profitable. They say that people should be able to make money while providing food that is healthy to mankind. 
 Question:Why do people want to increase organic farming? 
A. More and more people demand chemicals to grow food. 
B. Profits from organic farming help make approval programs. 
C. There are fewer chemicals available to the human beings. 
D. Organic food is good for the Earth and the human beings. 
 Answer: D
Context: In recent years, the world has made progress in reducing deaths among children under the age of five. A new report says an estimated 6.9 million children worldwide died before their fifth birthday. That compares to about twelve million in1990.
The report says child _ rates have fallen in all areas. It says the number of deaths is down by at least 50 percent in eastern, western and southeastern Asia. The number also fell in North Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.
Ties Boerma is head of the WHO's Department of Health Statistics and Informatics. He says most child deaths happen in just a few areas.
TIES BOERMA: ""Sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia face the greatest challenges in child survival. More than eighty percent of child deaths in the world occur in these two regions. About half of child deaths occur in just five countries--India, which actually takes twenty-four percent of the global total; Nigeria, eleven percent; the Democratic Republic of Congo, seven percent; Pakistan, five percent and China, four percent of under-five deaths in the world.""
Ties Boerma notes that, in developed countries, one child in one hundred fifty-two dies before his or her fifth birthday. But south of the Sahara Desert, one out of nine children dies before the age of five. In Asia, the mortality rate is one in sixteen.
The report lists the top five causes of death among children under five worldwide. They are pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria and problems both before and during birth.
Tessa Wardlaw is with the U-N Children's Fund. She is pleased with the progress being made in Sub-Saharan Africa. The area has the highest under-five mortality rate in the world. But she says the rate of decline in child deaths has more than doubled in Africa.
TESSA WARDLAW: ""We welcome the widespread progress in child survival, but we importantly want to stress that there's a lot of work that remains to be done. There's unfinished business and the fact is that today on average, around nineteen thousand children are still dying every day from largely preventable causes.""
The World Health Organization says one way to solve these problems is to make sure health care services are available to women. In this way, medical problems can be avoided or treated when identified. 
 Question:_   is the top-one cause of death among children under five worldwide. 
A. Global warming 
B. Malaria 
C. Pneumonia 
D. Diarrhea 
 Answer: C
Context: We can begin our discussion of ""population as a global issue"" with what most person mean when they discuss "" the population problem"": too many people on earth and a too rapid increase in the number added each year. The facts are not in dispute. It was quite right to employ a similar matter that linked demographic growth to "" a long, thin power fuse that burns steadily from time to time until it finally reaches the limit, and explodes"".
To understand the current situation, which is characterized by rapid increases in population, it is necessary to understand the history of population trends. Rapid growth is a comparatively recent phenomenon. Looking back at the 8,000 years of demographic history. We find that population have been really stable or growing very slightly for most of human history. For most of our ancestors, life was hard, often nasty, and very short. For most of human history, it was seldom the case that one in ten persons would live past forty, where infancy and childhood were especially risky periods. Often, societies were in clear danger of extinction because death rates could exceed their birth rates. Thus, the population problem throughout most of history was how to prevent extinction of the human race.
This pattern is important to know. Not only does it put the current problems of demographic growth into a historical perspective, but it suggests that the cause of rapid increase in population in recent years is not a sudden enthusiasm for more children, but an improvement in the conditions that traditionally have caused high rate of death.
Demographic history can be divided into two major periods: a time of long, slow growth which extended from about 8000B.C. till approximately 1650 A.D. And a period of rapid growth since 1650. In the first period of some 9,600 years, the population increased form some 8 million to 500 million in 1650. Between 1650 and the present, the population has increased from 500 million to more than 4 billion. And it is estimated that by the year 2020 there will be 8 billion people throughout the world. One way to appreciate this dramatic difference in such abstract numbers is to reduce the time frame to something that is more manageable. Between 8000B.C. and 1650, an average of only 50,000 persons was being added annually to the world's population each year. At present, this number is added very six hours. The increase is about 80,000,000 persons annually. 
 Question:How many people are born every six hours at present, according to the author? 
A. Eighty million. 
B. Eight thousand 
C. Fifty thousand 
D. Five million

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B
Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----. 
A. planted less corn

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT."" 
 Question:The price of the knives was cut down by half because   _  . 
A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap 
D. the knives were produced in one factory

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation.

But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns.

A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.

Context: TOKYO-- At first glance, Japanese cellphones are young people's favorites, with elegant design and quick access to the Internet. However, despite years of competition in overseas markets, Japan's cellphone makers have little presence beyond the country's shores.
The only Japanese cellphone maker with any meaningful global share is Sony Ericsson, and that company is a London-based joint venture between a Japanese electronics maker and a Swedish telecommunications firm.
And Sony Ericsson has been hit by big losses. Its market share was just 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009, behind Nokia of Finland, Samsung Electronics and LG of South Korea, and Motorola of Illinois.
This year, Mr Natsuno, who developed a popular wireless Internet service called i-Mode, invited some of the best minds in the field to debate how Japanese cellphones could go global.
""The most amazing thing about Japan is that even the average person out there will have a very advanced phone, ""said Mr Natsuno. Japan has 100 million users of advanced third-generation smart phones, twice the number of the United States, a much larger market. Many Japanese rely on their phones, not a PC, for Internet access.
Indeed, Japanese cellphone makers thought they had positioned themselves to dominate the age of digital data. But they were a little too clever. In the 1990s, they set a standard for the second-generation network that was refused everywhere else. Then Japan quickly adopted a third-generation standard in 2001. However, it made Japanese phones too advanced for most markets.
Several Japanese companies are now considering a push into overseas markets, including NEC. Panasonic, Sharp, Toshiba and Fujitsu are said to be planning similar moves.
""Japanese cellphone makers need to either look overseas, or exit the business"", said Kenshi Tazaki, a managing vice president at the consulting firm Gartner Japan. 
 Question:Which of the following would be the best title for the passage? 
A. Japanese cellphone companies are unsuccessful. 
B. Japan has more cellphone users than the US. 
C. Japanese cellphone industry intends to expand overseas markets. 
D. Going global--a difficult task for Japanese companies.

Context: Why Doesn't Anybody Copy Apple?
Apple's products are the envy of the world. They have been spectacularly successful and are widely imitated, if not copied. The minute Apple crystallizes a product, everyone knows how to compete. This idea that the basis of competition is set by Apple and then the race is on to climb the path of improvement is unquestionable. When Apple releases a product that defines a category or dramatically changes the structure of an industry, it becomes obvious what needs to be built. But what I wonder is why everyone wants to copy Apple's products but nobody wants to copy being Apple?
I can think of two reasons. Firstly, Apple is not worth copying because it's not successful; secondly, Apple's success cannot be copied because it is a magical process.
There is a great deal of evidence for the first hypothesis. The idea of Apple being successful is not something reflected in its stock price. Being valued lower than the average company in the S&P 500 indicates that to whatever degree Apple was successful in the past, it's not seen by the vast majority of observers as successful in the future. Why should one bother copying Apple if it results in being punished with a low valuation? If one works really hard at innovation and then that innovation becomes commoditized very quickly, why should one bother?
When innovation practitioners are asked what makes Apple successful,the answers regarding the cause of this success border on the mythical.The climax of this hypothesis is the ""chief-sorcerer""theory of success which places one magician,like Steve Jobs,in charge of casting all the right spells 
What about Apple's own opinion of what makes it tick? Tim Cook refers to a great team and integration of hardware, software and services as unique Apple advantages. It's a better explanation. Integration is something that can take a long time, but it is possible with great effort. A few companies are starting to make moves in that direction, but efforts are half-hearted. There is no ""move the Earth"" panic to become an integrated company from Samsung, Google or Microsoft.
My own suspicion is that Apple is more aware of what makes it special than it lets out. However, as Tim points out, it's not a formula. It's complex, it's subtle, but it's not magic. It's a process that requires a degree of faith and courage. 
 Question:What does the author think of Tim Cook's statement? 
A. Doubtful 
B. Acceptable 
C. Unbelievable 
D. Disappointing 
 Answer: B
Context: As Apple tries to maintain its growth and success in China, the world's largest smart-phone market is becoming even more critical. Apple's shares  fell sharply as the company's earnings for the holiday quarter through December disappointed investors.
The sales of the iPhone, which include both the iPhone 5 and older models, came in at the low end of analysts' expectations, while the company's income plan for the second quarter was below analysts' forecasts, though Apple is known to give conservative   forecasts.
Som'6 analysts have said that for Apple to regain its growth, the company.needs a more aggressive strategy for markets, or more specifically for China, where the market for smart phones has been expanding more rapidly than anywhere else. In China, demand is particularly great for inexpensive phones that run on Android  operating system, sold by many Chinese phone makers as well as South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.
But Apple says it's already enjoying strong growth in China. ""We saw big growth in iPhones,""Chief Executive Tim Cook said. He said that the company has been quickly expanding its sales channels in China, including the number of Apple stores. ""This isn't nearly what we need, we're not even close to that, but we're making great progress. "" he said.
In China, a big missing piece for Apple is China Mobile Ltd. , the biggest local telecom carrier that doesn't yet sell the iPhone. Earlier this month, Mr. Cook met China Mobile Chairman Xi Guohua in Beijing and discussed cooperation, stirring hopes that the world's largest mobile carrier may soon start offering the iPhone.
Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is working on a lower-end iPhone that could launch as early as this year. But one possible challenge for Apple in China is that low-pricod Android-based phones are getting better in terms of quality. A report from CLSA in late November showed that many smart-phones sold at about 1,000 yuan ( $160) came with higher-reso-lution screens, better cameras and more powerful processors than phones at that price did a year earlier. 
 Question:What can we learn from the passage? 
A. Apple tends to offer a lower sales forecast. 
B. China Mobile Ltd began to team up with Apple. 
C. Cook is pessimistic about what Apple did in China. 
D. Apple didn't take measures to develop Chinese market.

Context: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth.
An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, ""the worst came to the worst"". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door.
The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced.
Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank. He says the plant seeds would only be used when all other seeds are gone for some reason. Norwayfirst proposed the idea in the 1980s. But security concerns delayed the plan. At that time, the Soviet Union was meeting inRomeof the Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the above passage? 
A. The government of Norwaywill perform the project alone. 
B. Seeds to be collected there were produced ten thousands years ago. 
C. Spitsbergen is chosen because it is free of the threat unclear war forever. 
D. Temperature is a major consideration when choosing the storage place.

Context: prefix = st1 /China's economic growth 'hard to predict'
The worsening global economic situation makes it difficult for Chinato predict its growth for next year, a senior official said on Friday.
""How fast China's economy will grow next year is uncertain,"" Liu He, deputy director of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Finance and Economy Work, told China Daily.
""To a large  _ , the rate will be decided by the external situation,"" Liu said during a discussion with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and other economists in Beijing.
This year, GDP is estimated to grow at 9.4 or 9.5 percent, down from 10.6 percent last year, he said. However, the impact of the current financial turbulence ""on our economy is much less than on the rest of the world"", he said.
Nicholas Stern, a former UK government advisor, also told China Daily it will take at least one or two years for the world to recover from the recession, which is now spreading from the US and the UK to the rest of the world.
""We don't know how long the recession will last, but it is unlikely to be short,"" he said.
Liu said China can use the downturn as an opportunity to restructure its economy, which has relied heavily on government investment, foreign trade and low-cost technology over the past years.
""When the economy is experiencing fast growth, companies are unwilling to upgrade their technologies,"" Liu said.
""The slowdown gives such firms the opportunity to enhance their competitive edge through better technologies.""

Context: If your parents take out a loan, remind themselves to make the payments on time. Otherwise it will become a negative record in their personal credit reports, which are playing an increasingly big role in people's daily lives. A story carried by Chongqing Morning Post in June, underlines this trend.
According to the report, a Chongqing student borrowed money from the bank to finance his university studies. After he graduated in 2005, he went to work in Shenzhen. Later, he wanted to buy a house using loans. But several banks turned down his loan applications. The reason was that he had not paid back 1,500 yuan he borrowed from a bank when he was at university.
A personal credit rating is becoming an essential ""pass"" in everyday life, as China establishes a nationwide credit database. Personal credit systems go back 150 years. In developed countries, enterprises and banks use them to decide whether or not to loan money or do other business with a person.
A credit report estimates the credit worthiness of an individual, a company, or even a country. It is an evaluation made by credit bureaus of a borrower's overall credit history and his or her ability to repay debt. A poor credit rating means a high risk of defaulting on a loan, and thus leads to the refusal of a loan by the lender.
Today in China, credit history in banks is the major content of a credit report. But in the future, reports will include information about the payment of telephone bills, water use fees, electricity and natural gas bills, and taxes, according to officials of the People's Bank of China, the central bank.
Personal information such as appearance, genetic data, fingerprints, blood type, disease history, ethnic identity, family and religious beliefs are not to be included in credit reports, according to a draft regulation on credit rating issued last year by the Sate Council. The authors of the draft have just finished soliciting  public opinions.
The Credit Reference Center run by the People's Bank of China is in charge of developing a nationwide credit database. Credit reports for all people with bank transactions  began in 2006.
A personal credit rating is important to the social and economic activities of a person. According to the draft, if you have a personal negative credit record, it will be kept for five years. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE? 
A. Personal credit systems go back 150 years in China. 
B. You can turn to the People's Bank of China for the information about your credit report. 
C. Credit history in banks is the only content of a credit report. 
D. Credit reports began in 2006 in China.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT.""

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B
Context: A U.S. dad quit his job, giving up a massive salary, after his 10-year-old daughter gave him a 22-point list outlining all the events he missed so far during the year. As the CEO of the $2 trillion global investment fund PIMCO, Mohamed El-Erian shocked the finance industry when he quit in January.
El-Erian said it was about a year ago when he was repeatedly asking his daughter to brush her teeth, but she wasn't listening. When he asked her why, she responded with a list of 22 milestones he had missed: like the first day of school and the first soccer game of the season.
""And the school year wasn't yet over,"" El-Erian wrote. ""I felt awful and got defensive: I had a good excuse for each missed event! Travel, important meetings, and urgent phone call, sudden to-dos. But it dawned on me that I was missing an infinitely more important point. My work-life balance had gotten out of whack, and the imbalance was hurting my very special relationship with my daughter. I was not making enough time for her."" El-Erian explained he was struggling with the same thing so many parents do--work-life balance.
Dads who are quitting their profit-making jobs to improve work-life balance is a subject that is getting more traction as some high-profile executive have recently written about their experiences.
Last month, former MongoDB CEO Max Schireson wrote a blog post for Time about his decision to step down from the company's top job. He wrote that he struggled to make time for his three children because he was flying around half a million kilometres a year for work.
""I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car, or when my son had an emergency surgery,"" Schireson wrote.
On an overnight flight to Texas he woke up in Arizona to discover the plane made an emergency landing and some traumatized crew members had to be replaced. He decided it was time to address his work-life balance.
Quitting is something El-Erian and Schireson were financially able to do, but El-Erian recognizes most people don't have this luxury. He hopes companies will pay attention to improving work-life balance for their employees.
El-Erian now manages ""a portfolio of part-time jobs"" that don't require as much travel. He alternates mornings with his wife taking their daughter to school and he often picks her up from school.
""So far, it's been the right decision for me,"" he wrote. ""I'm so grateful that this is providing me greater opportunity to experience key moments in my daughter's life before they're all too quickly gone."" 
 Question:El-Erian resigned from PIMCO mainly because   _  . 
A. his daughter has been missing him badly 
B. he was getting bored with the endless flights 
C. he hoped to get his daughter to listen to her 
D. he wanted to experience his daughter's milestones 
 Answer: D
Context: Around 200 people who thought their only experience of the London 2012 Olympic Games would be minor heats of synchronized swimming   have received an unexpected hange to the men's 100m final because of an embarrassing ticketing mistake.
The London 2012 Organising Committee (Locog) confirmed on Wednesday that an error n its ticket selling had led to four synchronised swimming competitions being oversold by 10, 000 tickets.
Locog and its ticket agent spent the Christmas period contacting ticket holders and offering them alternatives that included the tickets they had applied for but unsuccessful.The hanges need no additional cost.It has also offered to return any discrepancy   if the n ew tickets cost less than the originals.Locog said the replacement tickets would come from a number of unsold seats across the Olympic Games and  _ was doing all it could to make up the error to the fans who bought tickets.
Locog said the error occurred in the summer, between the first and second round of ticket sales, when a member of staff made a mistake, entering ""20,000"" into the computer rather than the correct figure of 10,000 remaining tickets.The error was discovered when Locog checked the number of tickets that had been sold against the final seating numbers, and began contacting ticket holders before Christmas.
Thousands of ticket holders have already struck lucky, changing to tickets for major events including swimming and athletics finals, and in around 200 cases the hottest of all, the men's 100m final.Locog said the decision to award 100m final tickets was made because one of the synchronised swimming competitions was on the same afternoon as the event, August 5. 
 Question:Which of the following is true according to the text? 
A. The synchronized swimming is the hottest of the Olympics. 
B. Thousands of ticket holders refused to change their tickets. 
C. The men's 100m final will take place on August 5, 2012.

Context: Many cities around the world today are heavily polluted. Careless methods of production and lack of consumer demand   for environment friendly products have contributed to the pollution problem. One result is that millions of tons of glass, paper, plastic and metal container are produced, and these are difficult to get rid of.
However, today, more and more consumers are choosing ""green"" and demanding that the products they buy should be safe for the environment. Before they buy a product, they ask questions like these, ""Will this shampoo damage the environment?"" ""Can this metal container be reused or can it only be used once?""
A recent study showed that two out of five adults now consider the environment safety of a product before they buy it. This means that companies must now change the way they make and sell their products to make sure that they are ""green"", that is, friendly to the environment.
Only a few years ago, it was impossible to find green products in supermarkets, but now there are hundreds. Some supermarkets' products carry labels   to show that the product is green. Some companies have made producing of clean and safe products their main selling points and emphasize   it in their advertising.
The concern for a safer and cleaner environment is making companies rethink how they do business. No longer will the public accept the old attitude of ""Buy it, use it, throw it away, and forget it."" The public pressure is on, and gradually business is cleaning up its act.

Context: Stacey Hillman, who is 10 years old, was reading a magazine about police dogs needing bulletproof vests  . She thought that someone should start raising money for the police dogs.
After she got permission from Chief LaBrusciano, she went to the County Sheriff Don Eslinger. She got busy visiting all the police dogs and telling the departments about her new charity. She made ""collection boxes"" by using bottles and put a picture of her with a police dog on it. She put these bottles in vet's offices and pet stores.
The Chief from her hometown police department helped make Stacey's idea an official charity -- Pennies to Protect Police Dogs. The more money she collected, the more popular she became, and the more people offered to donate and help her with her goal   of giving every police dog effective protection. 
Stacey travels all around her state to raise money and tell people how important the police dogs are. She speaks at schools, and they donate to her charity, too. Since Stacey started her charity, she has bought bulletproof vests for the police dogs with all the 140 thousand dollars she has raised. But she has many more K-9 friends that still need to be protected and she promises to keep doing her charity until every police dog in the whole country has a bulletproof vest.
Each vest costs $700, and every police dog should have one. There are not always tax dollars to provide K-9s with these vests, and very few departments have them. The police dogs save lives just like police officers do, and often the police dogs are the first to go in. Stacey depends on donations from everyone to provide the dogs with bulletproof vests. 
 Question:How many bulletproof vests has Stacey bought for the police dogs? 
A. 100. 
B. 140. 
C. 200. 
D. 700.

Context: Why are we addicted to upgrades? According to Donald Norman, American author of the book The Design of Everyday Things, ""planned obsolescence""  is the trick behind the upgrading culture of today's consumer electronics industry.
The New York Times cited Norman last month, saying that electronics manufactures strategically release new upgrades periodically, both for hardware and software, so that customers on every level feel the need to buy the newest version.
""This is an old-time trick- they're not inventing anything new,"" he said.
Thomas Wensma, a Dutch designer, despises the ""planned obsolescence"" of companies, as recently reported by UK-based The Guardian.
Wensma said this is a wasteful system through which companies - many of them producing personal electronics - release shoddy products simply because ""they know that, in six months or a year, they'll put out a new one"".
But the new psychology of consumers is part of this system, as Wensma said to the newspaper: ""We now want something new, something pretty, the next shiny thing.""
 _ 
""It's to the damage of the consumer and the environment,"" as the New York Times quoted Norman. ""But perhaps to the betterment of the stockholder.""
In its most recent fiscal  year, Apple's profit margin was more than 21 percent, reported the Los Angeles Times. At Hewlett-Packard, the world's biggest PC manufacturer, it was only 7 percent.
""Steven Jobs pushed the principle of 'planned obsolescence' to new heights,"" the newspaper commented on the company's profits and marketing strategy. ""Apple's annual upgrades of its products generate sales of millions of units as owners of one year's MacBook or iPhone line up to buy the newest version, even when the changes are incremental.""
Peer pressure
As to Li Jijia, the need for upgrading his smart phone comes mainly from friends and classmates. When the majority of friends are switching to the latest devices, he worries about feeling left out.
""Some apps and games require better hardware to run,"" said Li. ""If you don't join in, you lose part of the connection to your friends."" 
 Question:Thomas Wensma's attitude to the ""planned obsolescence"" is   _  . 
A. positive 
B. negative 
C. indifferent 
D. neutral

Context: To get a chocolate out of a box requires a lot of unpacking: the box has to be taken out of the paper bag in which it arrived, the cellophane   wrapper has to be tom off, the lid opened and the paper removed, the chocolate itself then has to be unwrapped from its own piece of paper:  But  _ .  It is now becoming increasingly difficult to buy anything that is not done up in beautiful wrapping.
The package itself is of no interest to the shopper, who usually throws it away immediately. Useless wrapping accounts for much of the refuse put out by the average London house-hold each week  So why is it done? Some of it, like the cellophane on meat, is necessary, but most of the rest is simply competitive selling.  This is absurd.Packaging is using up valuable energy and resources and polluting the environment.
Recycling is already happening with milk bottles which are returned to the dairies , washed out, and refilled. But both glass and paper are being threatened by the growing use of plastic. More dairies are experimenting with plastic bottles.
The trouble with plastic is that it does not rot  Some environmentalists argue that the only solution to the problem of ever increasing plastic containers is to throw away plastic altogether in the shops, a suggestion unacceptable to many producers who say there is no alternative   to their handy plastic packs.
It is evident that more research is needed into the recovery and re-use of various materials  and into the cost of collecting and recycling containers rather than producing new ones.  Unnecessary packaging, intended to be used just once, and make things look better so more people will buy them, is clearly becoming increasingly absurd  But it is.not so much a question of throwing away packaging as using it wisely.What is needed now is a more advanced approach  to using scarce resources for what is, after all,  a  ly unimportant function. 
 Question:Some environmentalists think that   _  . 
A. plastic packaging should be made more convenient 
B. no alternative can be found to plastic packaging 
C. too much plastic is wasted 
D. shops should stop using plastic containers

Context: The Guidance Department   at Burrville High School has a staff   of eleven. Most of their work is done with the students. But the staff sees a lot of parents, too. 
""Parent meetings form a clear monthly pattern,"" says Mildred Foreman, Guidance Director. ""This pattern stays much the same from year to year. The busy months are October, March and May."" 
September starts rather slowly. Few parents come in. Most of them want to discuss the schedules. October brings many behaviour problems. Some parents are called in. Others come by themselves. Things quiet down in November. December is a quiet month. ""It's the holiday,"" Ms. Foreman says. ""People want to come in, I know, but they decide to wait until after New Year's Day."" 
Report cards go home just before Christmas holidays. Bad marks bring parents in as school reopens. This happens again in March, another report card month. May is always the year's busiest month. That's when parents realize that their children might be held back  . They come in to see if anything can be done before things are decided in June.

Context: As Apple tries to maintain its growth and success in China, the world's largest smart-phone market is becoming even more critical. Apple's shares  fell sharply as the company's earnings for the holiday quarter through December disappointed investors.
The sales of the iPhone, which include both the iPhone 5 and older models, came in at the low end of analysts' expectations, while the company's income plan for the second quarter was below analysts' forecasts, though Apple is known to give conservative   forecasts.
Som'6 analysts have said that for Apple to regain its growth, the company.needs a more aggressive strategy for markets, or more specifically for China, where the market for smart phones has been expanding more rapidly than anywhere else. In China, demand is particularly great for inexpensive phones that run on Android  operating system, sold by many Chinese phone makers as well as South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.
But Apple says it's already enjoying strong growth in China. ""We saw big growth in iPhones,""Chief Executive Tim Cook said. He said that the company has been quickly expanding its sales channels in China, including the number of Apple stores. ""This isn't nearly what we need, we're not even close to that, but we're making great progress. "" he said.
In China, a big missing piece for Apple is China Mobile Ltd. , the biggest local telecom carrier that doesn't yet sell the iPhone. Earlier this month, Mr. Cook met China Mobile Chairman Xi Guohua in Beijing and discussed cooperation, stirring hopes that the world's largest mobile carrier may soon start offering the iPhone.
Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is working on a lower-end iPhone that could launch as early as this year. But one possible challenge for Apple in China is that low-pricod Android-based phones are getting better in terms of quality. A report from CLSA in late November showed that many smart-phones sold at about 1,000 yuan ( $160) came with higher-reso-lution screens, better cameras and more powerful processors than phones at that price did a year earlier. 
 Question:What can we learn from the passage? 
A. Apple tends to offer a lower sales forecast. 
B. China Mobile Ltd began to team up with Apple. 
C. Cook is pessimistic about what Apple did in China. 
D. Apple didn't take measures to develop Chinese market.

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.

Context: Why are we addicted to upgrades? According to Donald Norman, American author of the book The Design of Everyday Things, ""planned obsolescence""  is the trick behind the upgrading culture of today's consumer electronics industry.
The New York Times cited Norman last month, saying that electronics manufactures strategically release new upgrades periodically, both for hardware and software, so that customers on every level feel the need to buy the newest version.
""This is an old-time trick- they're not inventing anything new,"" he said.
Thomas Wensma, a Dutch designer, despises the ""planned obsolescence"" of companies, as recently reported by UK-based The Guardian.
Wensma said this is a wasteful system through which companies - many of them producing personal electronics - release shoddy products simply because ""they know that, in six months or a year, they'll put out a new one"".
But the new psychology of consumers is part of this system, as Wensma said to the newspaper: ""We now want something new, something pretty, the next shiny thing.""
 _ 
""It's to the damage of the consumer and the environment,"" as the New York Times quoted Norman. ""But perhaps to the betterment of the stockholder.""
In its most recent fiscal  year, Apple's profit margin was more than 21 percent, reported the Los Angeles Times. At Hewlett-Packard, the world's biggest PC manufacturer, it was only 7 percent.
""Steven Jobs pushed the principle of 'planned obsolescence' to new heights,"" the newspaper commented on the company's profits and marketing strategy. ""Apple's annual upgrades of its products generate sales of millions of units as owners of one year's MacBook or iPhone line up to buy the newest version, even when the changes are incremental.""
Peer pressure
As to Li Jijia, the need for upgrading his smart phone comes mainly from friends and classmates. When the majority of friends are switching to the latest devices, he worries about feeling left out.
""Some apps and games require better hardware to run,"" said Li. ""If you don't join in, you lose part of the connection to your friends."" 
 Question:Thomas Wensma's attitude to the ""planned obsolescence"" is   _  . 
A. positive 
B. negative 
C. indifferent 
D. neutral

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT."" 
 Question:The price of the knives was cut down by half because   _  . 
A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap 
D. the knives were produced in one factory

Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption 
 Answer: D
Context: By 2050, half of the world's population will live in the tropics--the  ly warm belt that circles the globe--according to State of the Tropics, a report released today. Rapid population growth, along with economic growth, means that the region's influence will grow in coming decades, the authors of the 500-page work predict.
The project, first launched in 2011, aimed to answer one significant question: Is life in the tropics improving? To find out, the researchers analyzed environmental, social, and economic indicators collected over 6 decades. It finds that the region has made ""extraordinary progress"" in many areas. For example, more people have access to safe drinking water, and the number of protected areas is increasing. The tropics also have outperformed the rest of the world in economic growth over the past 30 years.
However, some challenges remain. Investment in research and development, for example, has increased cautiously, but tropical nations still invest less than the rest of the world. ""As a proportion of GDP the Rest of the World invests almost four times as much in research and development than the Tropics."" concludes the report.
The report also includes a new analysis of how climate change will affect the region. Many plant and animal species are moving poleward in an attempt to stay within their preferred environmental conditions in the tropics, the authors write. However, some organisms may not be able to keep pace with the changing conditions, they predict. As a result, they can experience population declines or go extinct.
In addition, an expanded tropical zone also threatens health and safety issues, the authors warn. As regions become more suitable to insects such as mosquitoes and ticks, the spread of insect-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, and Lyme disease could rise, causing a burden to human health and the economy. 
Bruna, a researcher, says he sees a lot to be concerned about in the report. ""While we've made incredible advances in some areas, I think the risks for the tropics that are highlighted in this report are things that we really need to be concerned about.""

Context: Decreasing grain prices along with growing costs of production means Chinese farmers are unlikely to see a significant rise in income next year. [:ZXXK]
China's economic planning chief Ma Kai expressed the concern as the government undertakes an ambitious program to improve rural people's lives.
Grain prices have been dropping since April; and prices of wheat, corn and rice fell 5 per cent from August to October compared with the same period last year, Ma, minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, told an annual meeting on development and reform held over the weekend.
Meanwhile, prices of production materials rose 9.1 per cent year on year during the first 10 months.
The situation makes it difficult to achieve a ""new socialist countryside,"" which was last week highlighted as a new concept and ""common action"" of the whole Party and nation.
Vice-Minister of Agriculture Yin Chengjie also said China's entry to the World Trade Organization also creates _ for income rises for the country's 780 million farmers.
Farmers' income is expected to increase by 5 per cent this year, hitting the target set by the central government at the beginning of this year.
Last year, per capita net income of Chinese farmers reached 2,936 yuan (US$362), up 6.8 per cent year on year, and the highest increase since 1997.
Ma also said China would continue to seek fast, steady economic growth in 2012 but more efforts will be made to deal with the challenges brought about by overheating in some industrial sectors  .

Context: Wealth starts with a goal saving a dollar at a time. Call it the piggy bank strategy . There are lessons in that time-honored coin-saving container.
Any huge task seems easier when reduced to baby steps. I f you wished to climb a 12,000-foot mountain, and could do it a day at a time, you would only have to climb 33 feet daily to reach the top in a year. If you want to take a really nice trip in 10 years for a special occasion, to collect the $15,000 cost, you have to save $3.93 a day. If you drop that into a piggy bank and then once a year put $1,434 in a savings account at 1% interest rate after-tax, you will have your trip money.
When I was a child, my parents gave me a piggy bank to teach me that, if I wanted something, I should save money to buy it. We associate piggy banks with children, but in many countries, the little containers are also popular with adults. Europeans see a piggy bank as a sign of good fortune and wealth. Around the world, many believe a gift of a piggy bank on New Year's Day brings good luck and financial success. Ah, but you have to put _ in it.
Why is a pig used as a symbol of saving? Why not an elephant bank, which is bigger and holds more coins? In the Middle Ages, before modern banking and credit instruments, people saved money at home, a few coins at a time dropped into a jar or dish. Potters  made these inexpensive containers from an orange-colored clay  called ""pygg,"" and folks saved coins in pygg jars.The Middle English word
for pig was ""pigge"". While the Saxons pronounced pygg, referring to the clay, as ""pug"", eventually the two words changed into the same pronunciation, sounding the ""i"" as in pig or piggy. As the word became less associated with the orange clay and more with the animal, a clever potter fashioned a pygg jar in the shape of a pig, delighting children and adults. The piggy bank was born.
Originally you had to break the bank to get to the money, bringing in a sense of seriousness into savings. While piggy banks teach children the wisdom of saving, adults often need to relearn childhood lessons. Think about the things in life that require large amounts of money--- college education, weddings, cars, medical care, starting a business, buying a home, and fun stuff like great trips. So when you have money, take off the top 10%, put it aside, save and invest wisely. 
 Question:The piggy ban originally was   _  . 
A. a potter's instrument 
B. a cheap clay container 
C. an animal-shaped dish 
D. a pig-like toy for children

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----.

Context: Is it time to kick Russia out of the BRICs  ? If so, it may end up sounding like a famous ball-point pen maker-BIC. An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device ,the BRICs, should really be the BICs.
""Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?"" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreigh Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of ""The Russian Balance Sheet"", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes:
""The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas. ""
Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing
far better than Russia.
But the BRICs are not just about economy. As is mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while around 80 percent is for the other three.
At very least, however, Russia's economic underperformance and stock market outperfoumance does suggest it is indeed one of the group. 
 Question:According to Aslund, Russia shouldn't be a BRIC partly because  _  . 
A. Russia's economic performance is far worse than the other three 
B. Russia's leaders are not good at managing economy 
C. Russia has taken effective measures to improve its economy 
D. Russia will no longer attract investors from other countries

Context: Climbers at the top of Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, will now be able to make video calls and surf the Internet on their mobile phones, a Nepalese   telecom group claims.
Ncell, a branch company of Swedish phone giant TeliaSonera, said on Thursday it had set up a high-speed third-generation (3G) phone base station at an altitude of 5,200 metres in the Everest region.
""Today we made the world's highest video call from Mount Everest base camp successfully. The coverage   of the network will reach up to the peak of Mount Everest,"" Ncell Nepal chief Pasi Koistinen told reporters in Kathmandu.
The installation   will also help tens of thousands of tourists and hikers who visit the world's highest mountain every year.
Climbers who reached its 8,848-metre peak previously depended on expensive satellite phones and a voice-only network set up by China Mobile in 2007 on the Chinese side of the mountain.
""This is a great milestone for mobile communications as the 3G high speed Internet will bring faster, more affordable telecommunication services from the world's tallest mountain,"" said Lars Nyberg, chief executive of TeliaSonera, which owns 80 percent of Ncell.
The 3G services will be fast enough to make video calls and use the Internet, said the company, which also claimed the world's lowest 3G base at 1,400 metres below sea level in a mine in Europe.
Despite the installation in Mount Everest, telecom services cover less than one-third of the 28 million people of Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world.
TeliaSonera said it planned to invest $ 100 million in the next year to ensure that mobile coverage increases to more than 90 per cent of the Himalayan nation's population.
The 3G network on Mount Everest puts TeliaSonera ahead of state-controlled Nepal Telecom, Indian-owned United Telecom and China Mobile.
Around 3,000 people have climbed to the Everest summit since Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to conquer the peak in 1953. 
 Question:According to Lars Nyberg, the 3G services they provide   _  . 
A. are fast and convenient 
B. are a little expensive 
C. can make voice-only calls 
D. offer free emailing 
 Answer: A
Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees 
 Answer: C
Context: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth.
An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, ""the worst came to the worst"". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door.
The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced.
Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank. He says the plant seeds would only be used when all other seeds are gone for some reason. Norwayfirst proposed the idea in the 1980s. But security concerns delayed the plan. At that time, the Soviet Union was meeting inRomeof the Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the above passage? 
A. The government of Norwaywill perform the project alone. 
B. Seeds to be collected there were produced ten thousands years ago. 
C. Spitsbergen is chosen because it is free of the threat unclear war forever. 
D. Temperature is a major consideration when choosing the storage place. 
 Answer: D
Context: In 1992, I had just launched a new business called Video News International.
It was the world's first video journalist network. The idea was to cover news and sell the service to news organizations.
One day, a young intern   who was working for us named Anthony Lappe pulled me aside.
""There is something you have to see,"" he told me. ""Comcast is doing this really cool thing.""
""What?""
""The Internet,"" he said. ""It's going to be really big.""
Anthony later introduced me to the head of the Internet project.

Well, I said I had lots of content to offer.
The guy's eyes lit up. ""Cool,"" he said. ""We would like to put it on our network.""
Well, I was always looking for new clients.
""What are you going to pay?"" I asked.
He said that they could not pay anything for the content, but they would set up a URL for me.
""What's that?"" I asked.
""It's kind of like your address on the web.""
""What would I do with this URL thing?""
""Well, it could be your business.""
""I don't see how it is a business, and there's not even any advertising,"" I cleverly replied.
""Not yet,"" he said. ""But one day there might be.""
I thought about it for two seconds.
""Naah..."" I said. "" _ . I've got to be going now. Maybe we can cooperate next time.""
And I walked out.
Idiot!
Well, that Internet thing turned out to be so much bigger than I had thought. I wish I had never made such a mistake. Sorry Anthony. You were right.

""This is a great milestone for mobile communications as the 3G high speed Internet will bring faster, more affordable telecommunication services from the world's tallest mountain,"" said Lars Nyberg, chief executive of TeliaSonera, which owns 80 percent of Ncell.
The 3G services will be fast enough to make video calls and use the Internet, said the company, which also claimed the world's lowest 3G base at 1,400 metres below sea level in a mine in Europe.
Despite the installation in Mount Everest, telecom services cover less than one-third of the 28 million people of Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world.
TeliaSonera said it planned to invest $ 100 million in the next year to ensure that mobile coverage increases to more than 90 per cent of the Himalayan nation's population.
The 3G network on Mount Everest puts TeliaSonera ahead of state-controlled Nepal Telecom, Indian-owned United Telecom and China Mobile.
Around 3,000 people have climbed to the Everest summit since Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to conquer the peak in 1953. 
 Question:According to Lars Nyberg, the 3G services they provide   _  . 
A. are fast and convenient 
B. are a little expensive 
C. can make voice-only calls 
D. offer free emailing 
 Answer: A
Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees 
 Answer: C
Context: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth.
An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, ""the worst came to the worst"". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door.
The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced.
Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank. He says the plant seeds would only be used when all other seeds are gone for some reason. Norwayfirst proposed the idea in the 1980s. But security concerns delayed the plan. At that time, the Soviet Union was meeting inRomeof the Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the above passage? 
A. The government of Norwaywill perform the project alone. 
B. Seeds to be collected there were produced ten thousands years ago. 
C. Spitsbergen is chosen because it is free of the threat unclear war forever. 
D. Temperature is a major consideration when choosing the storage place. 
 Answer: D
Context: In 1992, I had just launched a new business called Video News International.
It was the world's first video journalist network. The idea was to cover news and sell the service to news organizations.
One day, a young intern   who was working for us named Anthony Lappe pulled me aside.
""There is something you have to see,"" he told me. ""Comcast is doing this really cool thing.""
""What?""
""The Internet,"" he said. ""It's going to be really big.""
Anthony later introduced me to the head of the Internet project.
""We are looking for content to put on our network here,"" the guy said to me.
Well, I said I had lots of content to offer.
The guy's eyes lit up. ""Cool,"" he said. ""We would like to put it on our network.""
Well, I was always looking for new clients.
""What are you going to pay?"" I asked.
He said that they could not pay anything for the content, but they would set up a URL for me.
""What's that?"" I asked.
""It's kind of like your address on the web.""
""What would I do with this URL thing?""
""Well, it could be your business.""
""I don't see how it is a business, and there's not even any advertising,"" I cleverly replied.
""Not yet,"" he said. ""But one day there might be.""
I thought about it for two seconds.
""Naah..."" I said. "" _ . I've got to be going now. Maybe we can cooperate next time.""
And I walked out.
Idiot!
Well, that Internet thing turned out to be so much bigger than I had thought. I wish I had never made such a mistake. Sorry Anthony. You were right. 
 Question:The guy's offer was rejected because the author   _ 
A. didn't think it a good deal 
B. was unwilling to trust a stranger 
C. was too occupied to start a new business

Context: Six Chinese surveillance ships have entered waters near islands claimed by both China and Japan.
China said the ships were carrying out ""law enforcement"" to demonstrate its jurisdiction over the islands, known as Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan.
At least two of the vessels left after the Japanese coast guard issued a warning, Japanese officials say.
The move came after Japan sealed a deal to buy three of the islands from their private Japanese owner. Japan controls the uninhabited but resource-rich East China Sea islands, which are also claimed by Taiwan.
The Japanese Coast Guard said the first two Chinese boats entered Japan's territorial waters at 06:18 local time (21:18 GMT Thursday), followed by another fleet of four other ships just after 07:00. The first two ships then left the area. A third ship left later on Friday morning, one report said. No force was used, Japanese officials added. ""Our patrol vessels are currently telling them to leave our country's territorial waters,"" the coastguard said in a statement.
The Chinese foreign ministry confirmed that its ships were there. ""These law enforcement and patrol activities are aimed to demonstrate China's jurisdiction over the Diaoyu Islands and its affiliated islets and ensure the country's maritime interests,"" a statement said.
The US has called for ''cooler heads to prevail'' as tension intensifies between China and Japan over the islands, which lie south of Okinawa and north of Taiwan. US Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is due to visit both Japan and China from this weekend as part of a tour of the region that also includes New Zealand. 
The dispute has seriously marred diplomatic relations between China and Japan and threatens to damage the strong trading relationship, says the BBC's John Sudworth in Beijing. The row has also generated strong nationalist sentiment on both sides that observers say now makes it very difficult to be seen to be backing down, says our correspondent.
The Japanese government says it is buying the islands to promote their stable and peaceful management. Its move followed a bid by right-wing Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara to buy the islands using public donations - an action that would likely have further provoked China. 
China, on the other hand, says the islands have historically been its territory and fishing grounds.
Meanwhile Japan's newly-appointed ambassador to China, Shinichi Nishimiya, remains in hospital in Tokyo after he was found unconscious near his home in Tokyo on Thursday. No details have been given on his condition. He was appointed on Tuesday to replace Uichiro Niwa, who has been criticised for his handling of one of the worse diplomatic rows  between Japan and China in recent years. 
 Question:The Diaoyu Islands are actually inhabited by   _  . 
A. Japan 
B. China 
C. Taiwan 
D. Nobody

Context: Today, I will tell you a story about AbdulRahman, a friend of mine, who was the victim of the big name DHL. I am sure that 90% of you have at least heard of it. It is known for being the best company when it comes to shipping. It is thought to be fast ,reliable and safe. 
AbdulRahman's brother bought him a mobile phone while he was in the United Kingdom. He wanted to send it to him here in Kuwait .  AbdulRahman specifically asked him to send it through DHL. He trusted the company that much, as most people do.
But in the end, even though the company told him that it would take up to 5 days for the phone to arrive at AbdulRahman's door, he never received it. And after two weeks of him calling them and hearing the same response ""We will investigate the matter, and let you know of our decision by next week. We might pay you back up to 50% of the item's cost.""
So they are not paying him the full price of the thing they have lost, or as we think, they have stolen. We have reason to think that way, because according to the records, the mobile phone went ""missing"" while it was in a ""sorting facility"" of the company.
Last Tuesday, they stopped telling him ""We are investigating the matter"" and officially said, ""We ended the investigation. Your shipment is missing."" We are still waiting to hear their ""decision"" about whether they will try to make it up to him, by ""maybe"" paying him up to 50% , and nothing more. 
 Question:What does the writer think of DHL's response to the case? 
A. It is quick and in time. 
B. It is not bad. 
C. It is disappointing 
D. It is late but satisfying

Context: The Norwegian Government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down (though these have already been raised); and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the Government will be able to hold things back for long. As one Norwegian politician said last week: "" We will soon be changed beyond all recognition.""
Ever since the war, the Government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. During the past few years this program has had a great deal of success. Tromso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern policy could be in ruins.
The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 percent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad.
The real argument over oil is its threat to the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it, because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as essentially Norwegian. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most critical of the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the countryside and to the sea. 
 Question:According to the passage, the oil industry might lead northern Norway to   _  . 
A. the development of industry 
B. a growth in population 
C. the failure of the development program 
D. the development of new towns 
 Answer: C
Context: It doesn't look like the heart of a green revolution. The huge chimneys stick up above the line of pine trees and don't make for the most scenic view as you wander around the clear blue waters of the nearby lake.
But it is this power plant that has helped the small Swedish city of Vaxjo become arguably the greenest place in Europe. On closer observation, the only thing emerging from the chimneys is the faintest mists of steam. And inside it smells more like a sauna  than a furnace . That's because it is not oil fuelling the plant, but woodchip and other wood waste from the area's sawmills. And as well as generating electricity, it also supplies 90 per cent of this southern Swedish town with heating and hot water.[:Zxxk.Com]
The gases produced as the wood burns are changed into liquid form, and are purified before they reach the chimney. And instead of wasting this liquid, the power plant pumps it around town. Some runs out of the town's public taps; the rest is directed through pipes that run through individual heaters, warming homes and offices.
The pile of wood chippings in the yard towers above head height and takes almost five minutes to walk around. That's enough to keep Vaxjo warm on the snowiest day in winter, or supply it with hot water for a fortnight in summer, and it's good way of using the paper industry's waste. As well as the centuries-- old Swedish policy of planting a new tree for every one felled, the ashes swept out of the furnace each day find their way back to the forest as fertilizer .
It was this green plant that netted Vaxjo the European Union's award for sustainable development, making it the greenest city on the continent.
However, it is not just the citizen's consciences and moral histories to which the town's current day authorities are appealing. They know how to talk to their wallets too. Oil-generated electricity costs about 16,000 kronor a year(PS1,170) per person, while the new power plant's electricity comes in at two thirds of the price.
They've been planning for over ten years to become a ""Fossil Fuel Free City"". But according to Anders Franzen, the head of planning and development department at the city council: ""The battle in the energy sector has been won, yes, but the next battleground is transport."" 
 Question:What impresses the town's current-- day authorities most? 
A. The citizens' consciences. 
B. The town's moral histories. 
C. The lower cost of electricity 
D. The award for sustainable development 
 Answer: C
Context: I will never forget the tenth summer of childhood with my grandfather in western Norway at the mountain farm where my mother was born. As a boy ,I always thought people simply bought whatever they need. Whether Grandfather knew this, I don't know. One day he said, ""Come, I have something for you.""
I followed him to a workroom. ""You should have a toy boat. You can sail it at Storvassdal."" He said. Great, I thought,looking around for the boat. But there was none.
Grandfather pointed to a block of wood. ""The boat is in there,"" he said. Then he handed me some tools and showed me how to use them properly. ""It'll be a fine boat,and you'll make it with your own hands,"" he said,""No one can give you what you do for yourself."" The words rang in my head as I worked. Finished the boat. It wasn't much to look at ,but I was poud. Then I sailed it at Storvassdal.
We had to return to America. ""You cannot bring that boat home with you,"" my mother said. We already had too much baggage. Feeling sad, I hid my boat under a big rock at Storvassdal.
I said good-bye to Grandfather, not knowing I would never see him again.
In 1964, I went to Storvassdal with my parents and my wife and children. To my surprise,for 34 years my treasure stayed here,waiting for my return. I felt _ were togethet again although my grandfather had died 22 years before.
I carved""1930""and""1964"" on its side and put it back.
I returned to the lake in 1968,1971,1977 and 1988. Each time I had the boat and carved the year,my grandfather seemed near.
My last trip to Storvassdal was in 1991. I brought my granddaughters: Catherine,13; Claire,12. I hoped they would understand the importance of the little boat and its simple message. At Storvassdal, Claire said softly, 'Grandpa,someday I'll come back.' She added,""And I'll bring my children."" 
 Question:What lesson did the writer's grandfather probably teach him? 
A. Boys should have a toy boat at childhood.

Context: If you go to Finland, you'll be surprised to find how ""foolish"" the Finnish people are.
Take the taxi drivers for example. Taxis in Finland are mostly high class Benz with a fare   of two US dollars a kilometer. You can go anywhere in one, tell the driver to drop you at any place, say that you have some business to attend to, and then get off without paying your fare. And the driver would not show the least sign of worry.
The dining rooms in all big hotels not only serve their guests, but also outside diners. Hotel guests have their meals free, so their good faith is to wave their registration card to the waiter. With such a loose check, you can easily use any old registration card to take a couple of friends and dine free of charge.
With so many loopholes   in everyday life, surely Finland must be a heaven to those who love to take ""pretty advantages"". But the strange things is, all the taxi-passengers would always come back to pay their fare after they have attended to their business; not a single outsider has ever been found in the free hotel dining rooms. As the Finns always act on good faith and always show an attitude of ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" in everything they do, so to live in such a society has turned everyone into a real ""gentleman"". In a society of such high moral practice, what need is there for people to take precautions   against others? 
 Question:The sentences ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" show that   _  . 
A. the Finns are foolish 
B. the Finns take things seriously 
C. the Finns are busy making money for the family 
D. the Finns never take precaution against others

Context: The Norwegian Government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down (though these have already been raised); and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the Government will be able to hold things back for long. As one Norwegian politician said last week: "" We will soon be changed beyond all recognition.""
Ever since the war, the Government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. During the past few years this program has had a great deal of success. Tromso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern policy could be in ruins.
The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 percent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad.
The real argument over oil is its threat to the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it, because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as essentially Norwegian. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most critical of the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the countryside and to the sea. 
 Question:According to the passage, the oil industry might lead northern Norway to   _  . 
A. the development of industry 
B. a growth in population 
C. the failure of the development program 
D. the development of new towns 
 Answer: C
Context: In 2007.five young people in the American state of Massachusetts developed an idea. The team knew that the world is filled with mobile phones.About eighty percent of all people are said to live within reach of a wireless telephone signal.

Context: To understand the marketing concept, it is only necessary to understand the difference between marketing and selling. Not too many years ago, most industries concentrated primarily on the efficient production of goods, and then relied on ""persuasive salesmanship""  _ . Such production and selling focuses on the needs of the seller to produce goods and then convert  them into money.
Marketing, on the other hand, focuses on the wants of consumers. It begins with first analyzing the preferences and demands of consumers and then producing goods that will satisfy them. This eye-on-the-consumer approach is known as the marketing concept, which simply means that instead of trying to sell whatever is easiest to produce, the makers and dealers first find out what the consumer wants to buy and then go about making it available for purchase.
This concept does not imply that business is benevolent  or that consumer satisfaction is given priority over profit in a company. There are always two sides to every business transaction--the firm and the customer--and each must be satisfied before trade occurs. Successful merchants and producers, however, recognize that the surest route to profit is through understanding and catering to  customers. A striking example of the importance of catering to the consumer presented itself in mid-1985, when Coca Cola changed the flavor of its drink. The non-acceptance of the new flavor by a significant portion of the public brought about a prompt restoration  of the Classic Coke, which was then marketed alongside the new. 
 Question:The marketing concept discussed in the passage is   _  . 
A. the practice of turning goods into money 
B. making goods available for purchase 
C. the customer-centered approach 
D. a form of persuasive salesmanship 
 Answer: C
Context: The US will seek to expand its own oil production in an attempt to reduce dependence on imported oil and bring down fuel prices , President Obama says . New contracts for exploration will be signed in non-protected areas of Alaska and in the Gulf of Mexico.
In his weekly speech , the President insisted the US could reduce its need for imported oil and improve safety. Using his speech to tell Americans that he understood their concerns about rising prices, President Obama focused particularly on the price of fuel, which has risen in recent months.
US consumers have historically enjoyed cheap fuel , but have seen prices rise in recent months even though US oil production in 2010 reached its highest level for seven years.
Although the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 was serious, Mr Obama said the Gulf remained a key part of the country's future energy supply.
The President's proposals  come after Republicans   introduced a series of proposals that would expand and speed up oil and gas production.
The White House has criticized the Republican proposals for safety reasons , but Mr Obama was clear in his speech that he felt safety and environmental standards could be maintained even though production might rise.
"" I believe that we should continue to expand oil production in America --even as we increase safety and environmental standards ,""he said.
""As a nation, we should be investing in the clean, renewable sources of energy that are the solution to high gas prices.""
Mr Obama has previously called for a step-change in energy policy, saying the US must move towards getting 80%of its electricity from clean energy sources by 2035. 
 Question:What can we learn from the text ? 
A. The US has got most of its electricity from clean energy. 
B. US oil production is too small to keep the present low fuel prices. 
C. The US produced the most oil in 2010 in its history. 
D. The Gulf is still important in energy supply in spite of the oil spill in 2010.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees 
 Answer: C
Context: According to the Small Business Association, more than 50 percent of all small businesses fail within the first five years. This is not the case for Apiary Fund CEO, Shawn Lucas. Shawn has grown a very successful business focusing on teaching people how to trade foreign currencies. The Apiary Fund not only gives their traders some of the best Forex   education possible but also gives their traders money to trade with. The Apiary Fund had a slow start but has now become a company that recently hit $1 billion in trader volume  . The Apiary Fund's success has come from the great business concept, and work ethic  .
* Business Concept
The Apiary Fund has a very special but effective business concept, which Shawn Lucas discovered many years ago. You are probably wondering, where did this business concept come from? Shawn, while working as a Financial Advisor, received a phone call one day from a man he hadn't ever spoken to before. The man asked Shawn to go with him to China to do an analysis of a Chinese company's trading systems. The company at the time was under investigation for a possible violation   of intellectual property rights. He agreed to go and before he knew it he was on a plane to China.
During the analysis of this Chinese company Shawn noticed the company had a very effective business method. He noticed that the risk manager had created a system that protected the company from rarely posting a losing day. The risk manager made this all possible by putting restrictions on the amount a trader could lose. If one of the traders lost even a small amount the risk manager would then be notified  .
Shawn left China with a business concept that would later consume much of his life. After returning home, Shawn was devoted to creating a similar risk management system as the Chinese company had created. That risk management system turned into a successful business called the Apiary Fund.
* Work Ethic
The business concept alone didn't magically make the Apiary Fund into a booming business. The Apiary Fund became successful from hard work and devotion. This hard work and devotion has recently brought the Apiary Fund to hit a trading volume high of $1 billion. Shawn Lucas believes that by the end of this year the Apiary Fund can expect to see double or triple that volume. The company has experienced immense growth by making a few changes to their program structure, which has since increased growth by about five times within the last year.
Successful businesses are hard to start, but with a good business concept and great work ethic anything is possible. Shawn and the Apiary Fund are a great example of both. 
 Question:What does Shawn's business do? 
A. Trading with foreigners. 
B. Lend money to those who need it. 
C. Help people to found their own business. 
D. Teach people how to trade foreign currencies. 
 Answer: D
Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----. 
A. planted less corn 
B. planted morn crops 
C. planted morn wheat 
D. earned more money

Context: John McCain and Barack Obama call for closer U.S.-Chinese cooperation on trade, the environment and nuclear proliferation  in the upcoming issue of an American business group's magazine. They do so in an unusual effort to  _ voters abroad.
Both articles appeared Sunday on the website of the American Chamber of Commerce  in China, and will be published in China Brief, the chamber's monthly magazine, on September 22.
Both stress that the countries should work more closely to ease trade friction , fight global warming, improve military exchanges, and block the spread of nuclear weapons to such countries as Iran and North Korea. 
""Cooperation on the key, enduring global challenges, such as climate change, can deepen understanding and enhance confidence. """"We also need to deepen high-level dialogues on a sustained basis on economic, security and global political issues"", said Obama in the article.

Context: As long as you have broadband  service in your home, you can turn on your desktop computer and connect to the Internet. If you have a wireless router , a device that spreads the broadband connection to other devices, you can set up a Wi-Fi network, which enables your cellphones and tablets go online too. And when you are outdoors where is no Wi-Fi, such as in the park or at the beach, having 3G service allows you to stay connected.
It seems that lots of us have Internet coverage everywhere we go. So why have mobile companies around the world lately been so enthusiastic about a new term, ""4G""? First, you need to know that the letter :G"" stands for ""generation"". Even if you have no idea what 4G is, at least you can figure out that it is a step up from 3G since it's the latest generation of mobile internet service.
Unlike broadband, mobile Internet uses the same signal towers that provide voice service to your cellphone, which means wherever you can make phone calls with your cellphone you also have an Internet connection.
But mobile connections have their _ : they don't carry as much information as broadband does, making opening websites and downloading music slower than they are on a Wi-Fi connection. This is why mobile connections have been constantly upgraded since the first generation was launched back in the 1980s.
According to BBC, 4G is five to seven times faster than current 3G network speeds, almost as fast as home broadband. Because of this, 4G is widely suited for services like video downloading, mapping, online shopping and even video conferencing.
To achieve the high speeds, network companies have to spend a lot of money on building new signal towers, which will eventually lead to a higher phone bill if you switch to 4G, and you will also have to get a new phone with 4G capacity. 
 Question:What is the weakness of 3G compared with 4G? 
A. Its voice is not as clear as 4G 
B. It can't satisfy the users' basic needs. 
C. Its network speeds are much slower. 
D. It has much less popularity than 4G.

The machine works by drawing in damp air through a filter  and over a cooling element which changes it into water droplets.It can produce up to 12 liters a day.The Water Mill will also produce more water when storms pass over, as the humidity in the air increases.In keeping with its ecodevelopment,the machine uses the same amount of electricity as three light bulbs.
Inventor Jonathan Ritchey said:""The demand for water is
.People are looking for freedom from water distribution systems that are shaky and unreliable"".
The machine,which is about 3 feet wide,is likely to costPS800 when it goes on sale here in the spring.Its maker, Canadian firm Element Four, estimates that a liter of water will cost around 20 pence to produce.
Environmentalists claim half the world's population will face water shortage because of climate change by 2080.One in five humans is said to lack access to safe drinking water.
The Water Mill is not effective in areas with below about 30 percent relative humidity, but with average relative humidity in England of more than 70 percent that won't be much of an issue here. 
 Question:According to the author, the biggest advantage of the machine is its    _   . 
A. little power use 
B. unlimited source 
C. proper size 
D. high production

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: Fifteen years ago, I entered the Boston Globe, which was a temple to me then. It wasn't easy getting hired. But once you were there, I found, you were in.
Globe jobs were for life-guaranteed until retirement. For 15 years I had prospered there--moving from an ordinary reporter to senior editor. I would have a lifetime of security if I stuck with it. Instead, I had made a decision to leave. I entered my boss's office. Would he be angry? I wondered. He had a famous temper. ""Matt, we have to have a talk,"" I began. ""I came to the Globe when I was twenty-four. Now I' m forty. There' s a lot I want to do in life. I'm resigning.  "" ""To another paper?"" he asked. I reached into my coat pocket, but didn't say anything. I handed him a letter that explained everything. It said that I was leaving to start a new media company. We were at a rare turning point in history. I wanted to be directly engaged in the change. ""I' m glad for you,"" he said, quite out of my expectation. ""I just came from a board of directors meeting and it was seventy-five percent discouraging news. Some of that we can deal with. But much of it we can' t,"" he went on. ""I wish you all the luck in the world,"" he concluded. ""And if it doesn't work out, remember, there is always a place here for you.""
Then I went out of his office, walking through the newsroom for more good-byes. Everybody was saying congratulations. Everybody--even though I'd be risking all the financial security I had carefully built up.
Later, I had a final talk with Bill Taylor, chairman and publisher of the Boston Globe. He had turned the Globe into a billion-dollar property. ""I' m resigning, Bill,"" I said. He listened while I gave him the story. He wasn't looking angry either. After a pause, he said, ""Golly, I wish I were in your shoes. ""

Context: In 2007.five young people in the American state of Massachusetts developed an idea. The team knew that the world is filled with mobile phones.About eighty percent of all people are said to live within reach of a wireless telephone signal.    
    The idea was to use mobile phones and the Internet to connect job seekers with employers.The young people wrote a business plan and formed a company called Assured Labor.

    Through Assured Labor, companies will list open positions on the Internet.People who think
 they could do the job could reply by text messages or on their cellophanes.

    After a job is completed,the employer and employee rate each other, The rating is kept for  future use.Assured Labor is not charging anyone,right now, but the plan is to have employers pay for the service.

Context: In 1992, I had just launched a new business called Video News International.
It was the world's first video journalist network. The idea was to cover news and sell the service to news organizations.
One day, a young intern   who was working for us named Anthony Lappe pulled me aside.
""There is something you have to see,"" he told me. ""Comcast is doing this really cool thing.""
""What?""
""The Internet,"" he said. ""It's going to be really big.""
Anthony later introduced me to the head of the Internet project.
""We are looking for content to put on our network here,"" the guy said to me.
Well, I said I had lots of content to offer.
The guy's eyes lit up. ""Cool,"" he said. ""We would like to put it on our network.""
Well, I was always looking for new clients.
""What are you going to pay?"" I asked.
He said that they could not pay anything for the content, but they would set up a URL for me.
""What's that?"" I asked.
""It's kind of like your address on the web.""
""What would I do with this URL thing?""
""Well, it could be your business.""
""I don't see how it is a business, and there's not even any advertising,"" I cleverly replied.
""Not yet,"" he said. ""But one day there might be.""
I thought about it for two seconds.
""Naah..."" I said. "" _ . I've got to be going now. Maybe we can cooperate next time.""
And I walked out.
Idiot!
Well, that Internet thing turned out to be so much bigger than I had thought. I wish I had never made such a mistake. Sorry Anthony. You were right.

Context: If you go to Finland, you'll be surprised to find how ""foolish"" the Finnish people are.
Take the taxi drivers for example. Taxis in Finland are mostly high class Benz with a fare   of two US dollars a kilometer. You can go anywhere in one, tell the driver to drop you at any place, say that you have some business to attend to, and then get off without paying your fare. And the driver would not show the least sign of worry.
The dining rooms in all big hotels not only serve their guests, but also outside diners. Hotel guests have their meals free, so their good faith is to wave their registration card to the waiter. With such a loose check, you can easily use any old registration card to take a couple of friends and dine free of charge.
With so many loopholes   in everyday life, surely Finland must be a heaven to those who love to take ""pretty advantages"". But the strange things is, all the taxi-passengers would always come back to pay their fare after they have attended to their business; not a single outsider has ever been found in the free hotel dining rooms. As the Finns always act on good faith and always show an attitude of ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" in everything they do, so to live in such a society has turned everyone into a real ""gentleman"". In a society of such high moral practice, what need is there for people to take precautions   against others? 
 Question:The sentences ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" show that   _  . 
A. the Finns are foolish 
B. the Finns take things seriously 
C. the Finns are busy making money for the family 
D. the Finns never take precaution against others 
 Answer: B
Context: Is it time to kick Russia out of the BRICs  ? If so, it may end up sounding like a famous ball-point pen maker-BIC. An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device ,the BRICs, should really be the BICs.
""Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?"" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreigh Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of ""The Russian Balance Sheet"", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes:
""The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas. ""
Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing
far better than Russia.
But the BRICs are not just about economy. As is mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while around 80 percent is for the other three.
At very least, however, Russia's economic underperformance and stock market outperfoumance does suggest it is indeed one of the group. 
 Question:From the passage we know that   _  . 
A. Anders Aslund is working for the Russian government 
B. Russia outperfoumed the other three countries in stock market 
C. most people disagree Russia is included in BRICs 
D. the BRICs would end up being the BICs sooner or later 
 Answer: B

From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while around 80 percent is for the other three.
At very least, however, Russia's economic underperformance and stock market outperfoumance does suggest it is indeed one of the group. 
 Question:According to Aslund, Russia shouldn't be a BRIC partly because  _  . 
A. Russia's economic performance is far worse than the other three 
B. Russia's leaders are not good at managing economy 
C. Russia has taken effective measures to improve its economy 
D. Russia will no longer attract investors from other countries

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair.

A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.

Context: Mark Zukerberg is the founder and CEO of Facebook, an extremely popular social working website that started in the United States.
Now, millions of student users visit Facebook daily and the website is one of the top ten widely visited sites on the Internet worldwide. College and high school students use Facebook to communicate with friends and share both information and pictures for free. The company earns money through advertising.
Many other companies have been rumored to be interested in buying Facebook. Just a few years after Mark started the company, he was approached by Terry Semel, who was the CEO of Yahoo. Terry offered Mark one billion dollars($1,000,000,000) to sell Facebook to Yahoo. Mark said no, though. He stands behind his dreams at the very beginning. He knows the value of the company could fall down; however, he is in this to build something unbelievable, not be bought out by another company.
Maybe he was smart. Now Facebook is rumored to be worth billions of dollars and bigger companies like Microsoft or Google want a share of the company. Some private firms are also interested. Facebook could sell 15billion dollars if Mark decides to sell it at all. Perhaps Mark will just keep working from his California office to continue his dream of building something cool.

Context: In 1992, I had just launched a new business called Video News International.
It was the world's first video journalist network. The idea was to cover news and sell the service to news organizations.

The guy's eyes lit up. ""Cool,"" he said. ""We would like to put it on our network.""
Well, I was always looking for new clients.
""What are you going to pay?"" I asked.
He said that they could not pay anything for the content, but they would set up a URL for me.
""What's that?"" I asked.
""It's kind of like your address on the web.""
""What would I do with this URL thing?""
""Well, it could be your business.""
""I don't see how it is a business, and there's not even any advertising,"" I cleverly replied.
""Not yet,"" he said. ""But one day there might be.""
I thought about it for two seconds.
""Naah..."" I said. "" _ . I've got to be going now. Maybe we can cooperate next time.""

Context: John McCain and Barack Obama call for closer U.S.-Chinese cooperation on trade, the environment and nuclear proliferation  in the upcoming issue of an American business group's magazine. They do so in an unusual effort to  _ voters abroad.
Both articles appeared Sunday on the website of the American Chamber of Commerce  in China, and will be published in China Brief, the chamber's monthly magazine, on September 22.
Both stress that the countries should work more closely to ease trade friction , fight global warming, improve military exchanges, and block the spread of nuclear weapons to such countries as Iran and North Korea. 
""Cooperation on the key, enduring global challenges, such as climate change, can deepen understanding and enhance confidence. """"We also need to deepen high-level dialogues on a sustained basis on economic, security and global political issues"", said Obama in the article.
McCain agreed that the cooperation with prefix = st1 /Chinawould be essential in addressing issues of global concern. ""TheUnited Statesshares common interests withChinathat can form the basis of a strong partnership on issues of global concern, including climate change, trade and proliferation,"" he added. ""and I hope to see our relationship develop in a manner that benefits both countries and, in turn, the Asia-Pacific region and the world,"" he noted.
Both candidates  were impressed by China's economic success.
""Chinahas achieved extraordinary, sustained growth over the past three decades. Hundreds of millions of people inChinalive better now than most thought possible even two decades ago,"" Obama said.
""China's double-digit growth rates have brought hundreds of millions out of poverty, energized the economies of its neighbors and produced many new economic opportunities,"" McCain said.
Gao Wenhuan, 21st Century Online's special reporter, interviewed Marshall M. Bouton, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. ""My guess is, regardless of who is elected in November, you will hear basically the same description that Chinais a strategic partner and competitor,"" said Bouton.
A survey conducted by the Council in July 2008 found that the majority of respondents clearly admired China's accomplishments, but some Americans viewedChina's rising global power as a threat. According to the survey,Chinanow is seen as the most influential country in the world following theU.S..

Context: In 2007.five young people in the American state of Massachusetts developed an idea. The team knew that the world is filled with mobile phones.About eighty percent of all people are said to live within reach of a wireless telephone signal.    
    The idea was to use mobile phones and the Internet to connect job seekers with employers.The young people wrote a business plan and formed a company called Assured Labor.
    Assured Labor won a development competition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Three of the founders were graduate students there.    '
    Assured Labo is an electronic market place.It has two parts.One is for;the United States.That operation was launched in January in Boston.It links people with employees offering temporary jobs.
    The other arm of the business is for developing markets.That operation is meant to help people get mbfe permanent jobs.A representative is currently building partnerships with universities,and international companies in Central America.
    Assured Labor's president David Reich,says the companies now place job advertisements on radio or in newspapers.Some even drive around in cars with loudspeakers announcing that jobs are available.He says the companies are interested.in having more modem hiring practices.
    Through Assured Labor, companies will list open positions on the Internet.People who think
 they could do the job could reply by text messages or on their cellophanes.
    This is how the system works inprefix = st1 /Boston.
The jobs available include house cleaning.Dog walking and home repay. People who want their house cleaned,for example,can look online at a list of twenty housekeepers.The list tells what services.they offer,and how much they want to be paid.People need two letters praising their work to get on the list of service providers.
    The employer chooses workers they would like jot hire ,The company then sends the workers a text or e-mail message so they can respond quickly to an offer.
    After a job is completed,the employer and employee rate each other, The rating is kept for  future use.Assured Labor is not charging anyone,right now, but the plan is to have employers pay for the service. 
 Question:what kinds of jobs does Assured Labor offer? 
A. Temporary jobs. 
B. Permanent jobs. 
C. Free jobs

 Answer: C
Context: Supply and demand is perhaps one of the most basic concepts of economics and it is the backbone of a market economy. Demand refers to how much of a product or service is desired by buyers. The quantity demanded is the amount of a product people are willing to buy at a certain price; the relationship between price and quantity demanded is known as the demand relationship. Supply represents how much the market can offer. The quantity supplied refers to the amount of a certain goods producers are willing to supply when receiving a certain price. The relationship between price and how much of a goods or service is supplied to the market is known as the supply relationship. Price, therefore, is a reflection of supply and demand.
   The law of demand states that, if all other factors remain equal, the higher the price of a product, the fewer people will demand that product. The amount of goods that buyers purchase at a higher price is less as the price of a product goes up, so does the opportunity cost of buying that product.
   Like the law of demand, the law of supply shows the quantities that will be sold at a certain price. But unlike the law of demand, the supply relationship shows an upward slope. This means that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. Producers supply more at a higher price because selling a higher quantity at a higher price increases the whole income.
   Now that we know the laws of supply and demand, let's turn to an example to show how supply and demand affect price.
   Imagine that a CD of your favorite band is sold for $20. Because the record company's previous analysis showed that consumers will not demand CDs at a price higher than $20, only ten CDs were sold because the opportunity cost is too high for suppliers to produce more. If, however, the ten CDs are demanded by 20 people, the price will then rise. As a result, the rise in price should cause more CDs to be supplied as the supply relationship shows that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. If, however, there are 30 CDs produced and demand is still at 20, the price will not be pushed up because the supply is more than the demand. 
 Question:We know from the passage that changes in the prices of product cause changes in   _  . 
A. income and expense 
B. invention and production 
C. market and society 
D. supply and demand

Context: Local businessmen are increasingly facing competition from on line retailers. Larry Pollock, owner of Camera Co/Op on South Congress, said he has been dealing with this kind of problem for years, even before the Internet. The struggle began with mail-order catalogues, which are similar to online retailers in that they have few employees to pay, no sales tax fees and no business venue to lease and manage.
""Their overhead is lower, but they don't offer a service like we do,"" Pollock said.
Pollock, however, said providing a valuable service to customers does not always guarantee continued sales.
""We spend 30 minutes to an hour with somebody and they go home and buy it online,"" he said.
According to the state comptroller's office, online shopping is developing at a more rapid rate than traditional businesses.
In spite of how fair or unfair online shopping may be to the local businessmen, consumers will continue to turn to the Internet for its variety and accessibility, said Mitch Wilson, an online shopper. ""You have a larger selection and it's easier to compare prices.""
 Wilson said he built his personal computer and paid a third of the price by shopping online.
""Before the Internet, I would have had to go and buy an assembled computer from somebody like Dell,"" he said. ""Before I started shopping online I could never find all the pieces I wanted. No single store had everything needed, so shopping online saved me from having to buy from Dell.""
Janny Brazeal, a psychology freshman, said online shopping is too impersonal.
""I'd rather see it in person, touch it, know that I'm getting it,"" she said.
Brazeal also said she would not give out her credit card number or other personal information online no matter how safe the site claims it is.

Context: In 1992, I had just launched a new business called Video News International.
It was the world's first video journalist network. The idea was to cover news and sell the service to news organizations.
One day, a young intern   who was working for us named Anthony Lappe pulled me aside.
""There is something you have to see,"" he told me. ""Comcast is doing this really cool thing.""
""What?""
""The Internet,"" he said. ""It's going to be really big.""
Anthony later introduced me to the head of the Internet project.
""We are looking for content to put on our network here,"" the guy said to me.
Well, I said I had lots of content to offer.
The guy's eyes lit up. ""Cool,"" he said. ""We would like to put it on our network.""
Well, I was always looking for new clients.
""What are you going to pay?"" I asked.
He said that they could not pay anything for the content, but they would set up a URL for me.
""What's that?"" I asked.
""It's kind of like your address on the web.""
""What would I do with this URL thing?""
""Well, it could be your business.""
""I don't see how it is a business, and there's not even any advertising,"" I cleverly replied.
""Not yet,"" he said. ""But one day there might be.""
I thought about it for two seconds.
""Naah..."" I said. "" _ . I've got to be going now. Maybe we can cooperate next time.""
And I walked out.
Idiot!
Well, that Internet thing turned out to be so much bigger than I had thought. I wish I had never made such a mistake. Sorry Anthony. You were right.

Context: Sparrow is a fast-food chain with 200 restaurants. Some years ago, the group to which Sparrow belonged was taken over by another company. Although Sparrow showed no sign of declining, the chain was generally in an unhealthy state. With more and more fast-food concepts reaching the market, the Sparrow menu had to struggle for attention. And to make matters worse, its new owner had no plans to give it the funds it required.
Sparrow failed to grow for another two years. Until a new CEO, Carl Pearson, decided to build up its market share. He did a survey, which showed that consumers who already used Sparrow restaurants were extremely positive about the chain, while customers of other fast-food chains were unwilling to turn away from them. Sparrow had to develop a new promotional campaign.
Pearson faced a battle over the future of the Sparrow brand. The chain's owner now favored rebranding Sparrow as Marcy's restaurants. Pearson resisted, arguing for an advertising campaign designed to convince customers that visits to Sparrow restaurants were fun. Such an attempt to establish a positive relationship between a company and the general public was unusual for that time. Pearson strongly believed that numbers were the key to success, rather than customers' speeding power. Finally, the owner accepted his idea.
The campaign itself changed the traditional advertising style of the fast-food industry. The TV ads of Sparrow focused on entertainment and featured original songs performed by a variety of stars. Instead of showing the superiority of a specific product, the intention was to put Sparrow in the hearts of potential customers.
Pearson also made other decisions which he believed would contribute to the new Sparrow image. For example, he offered to lower the rent of any restaurants which achieved a certain increase in their turnover   .
These efforts paid off, and Sparrow soon became one of the most successful fast-food chains in the regions where it operated. 
 Question:What was Pearson's achievement as a CEO? 
A. He managed to pay off Sparrow's debts. 
B. He made Sparrow much more competitive 
C. He helped Sparrow take over a company 
D. He improved the welfare of Sparrow employees

Context: If you go to Finland, you'll be surprised to find how ""foolish"" the Finnish people are.
Take the taxi drivers for example. Taxis in Finland are mostly high class Benz with a fare   of two US dollars a kilometer. You can go anywhere in one, tell the driver to drop you at any place, say that you have some business to attend to, and then get off without paying your fare. And the driver would not show the least sign of worry.
The dining rooms in all big hotels not only serve their guests, but also outside diners. Hotel guests have their meals free, so their good faith is to wave their registration card to the waiter. With such a loose check, you can easily use any old registration card to take a couple of friends and dine free of charge.
With so many loopholes   in everyday life, surely Finland must be a heaven to those who love to take ""pretty advantages"". But the strange things is, all the taxi-passengers would always come back to pay their fare after they have attended to their business; not a single outsider has ever been found in the free hotel dining rooms. As the Finns always act on good faith and always show an attitude of ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" in everything they do, so to live in such a society has turned everyone into a real ""gentleman"". In a society of such high moral practice, what need is there for people to take precautions   against others? 
 Question:The sentences ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" show that   _  . 
A. the Finns are foolish 
B. the Finns take things seriously 
C. the Finns are busy making money for the family 
D. the Finns never take precaution against others

Context: In the 1920s and 30s the airlines were just beginning. It was unusual for people to travel by air because it was expensive and dangerous. In those days, there were no flight attendants to look after the passengers. Young men ,or ""stewards"" helped the passengers onto the airplane and carried the passengers' luggage but they did not provide food and drinks. _ 
Ellen Church was born in 1904 on a farm in Iowa. She was a different child. She didn't want to work on a farm or marry a farmer --she wanted a more adventurous life. Ellen studied to be a nurse at the University of Minnesota and then got a job in a hospital. For the next few years she stayed at the hospital but also took flying lessons and got her pilot's license.
Ellen was twenty-five years old when she first got in touch with Boeing Air Transport. She loved flying but she understood that airlines were a man's world. Although women like Emelia Earheart were becoming famous, she realized it was impossible for a woman to have a career as a pilot .But she had another idea. Most people were frightened of flying because. flying was still an unreliable  way to travel. There were often delays ,many crashes and the bad weathers made many passengers sick. Ellen thought nurses could take care of passengers during flights and B.A.T. agreed.
The young woman from Iowa and seven other nurses became the first air stewardesses.
At first pilots were unhappy because they did not want stewardesses on airplanes, but passengers loved the stewardesses. In 1940 there were around 1000 of them working for different airlines. The early ""stewardesses"" had to be under twenty-five-year-old, single and slim. When a woman joined an airline, she had to promise not to get married or have children. It was hard job and not well paid. They worked long hours and earned $1 an hour.
In the 1970s, stewardesses were unhappy in their job and airlines had to make some changes. Since the 1970s, ""stewardesses"" have been called flight attendants. They are well paid and work fewer hours than in the past. 
 Question:The passage mainly talks about   _  . 
A. the background of early flying pilots 
B. the experience of flying passengers 
C. the history of early flight attendants 
D. the development of airplanes 
 Answer: C
Context: If Kate McWilliams got a penny every time someone asked how old she was she would be on to a good thing.
Easyjet says the 26-year-old is its youngest ever commercial female airline captain.
She flies to around 100 destinations across the world and says most people ""are pleasantly surprised and impressed"" when she tells them her age.
But Kate isn't the youngest ever female captain.Ronan Milne got in touch with Newsbeat to say his colleague Dawn Hunter was made a captain aged 24 at Loganair.Sarah Hendry is also 24 and a captain with the same company.
Kate began flying in the air cadets  when she was 13 years old, but admitted to the Press Association that she never thought she could become a commercial pilot.However, following aviation training in Southampton, she joined easyJet as a co-pilot in May 2011.This August she took up the rank of captain after passing the airline's command course.
""Personally I don't think my age matters,"" she said. ""I've been through the same training and passed the same command course as every other captain so I've proven myself capable regardless of my age.""
Kate is originally from Carlisle, but now lives in Surrey so she can be near to Gatwick Airport.From there she flies Airbus A319 and A32 planes to locations across the world, including Iceland, Israel and Morocco.""I rarely fly to the same place twice in the same month,"" she said. ""That keeps things interesting.""
Around 5% of commercial pilots are women.Last year easyJet announced a plan to increase its number of female entrants to 12%.Julie Westhorp, chairwoman of the British Women Pilots' Association (BWPA), hopes Kate will inspire more women to think about working in aviation.She says: ""Both the BWPA and easyJet are aware of the importance of visible role models for girls and young women when making career choices and continue to work together to encourage young women to consider a pilot career."" 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? 
A. More women will take up a pilot career,inspired by Kate. 
B. Kate has flown to around 100 destinations across the Europe. 
C. Most people like the female pilot at such a young age. 
D. There are more training and couses for the female pilot.

Context: It isn't often that an entire industry is symbolized in the figure of a single human being, and such is the case with Canadian aviation and the aircraft industry. The man is the Hon. John A. D. McCurdy and the life story of this still vigorous , distinguished Canadian is at once and at the same time the thrilling history of aviation's progress in Canada.
It all began one cold February day in 1909 at Baddeck, Nova Scotia, when John McCurdy confounded  the critics by flying the Silver Dart, an aircraft designed by himself, for half a mile over the ice of Brasdeor Lakes. This was the first powered flight in Canada and the first by a British subject in the Commonwealth. McCurdy gave proof of his flying ability and of the development and the use of the aileron by being the first man in the world to carry out a figure  high in the air. He became the first to pilot a flying boat, taking off from Long Island Sound. He flew the first airplane to Mexico. In 1911 he had made the longest flight to date, and that over open sea 90 miles from Key West to Havana. He won the first crosscountry race in Canada 40 miles from Hamilton to Toronto and he transmitted the first radio message from aircraft.
When World WarIIcame, McCurdy took on board supervisory  authority for Canadian aircraft production by serving with the government in various senior positions.
Following World WarII, McCurdy was honored by being made lieutenant governor  of Nova Scotia where he made Canada's first historic flight. He now lives in Montreal with a summer home in Baddeck, site of his first flight. 
 Question:McCurdy is NOT the first one to   _  . 
A. fly in Canada 
B. pilot a flying boat 
C. fly from Key West to Toronto 
D. fly to Mexico 
 Answer: C
Context: For those who make journeys across the world, the speed of travel today has turned the countries into a series of villages.Distances between them appear no greater to a modern traveler than those which once faced men as they walked from village to village. Jet planes fly people from one end of the earth to the other, allowing them a freedom of movement undreamt of a hundred years ago.
Yet some people wonder if the revolution in travel has gone too far. A price has been paid, they say, for the conquest   of time and distance. _  .  The boat offers leisure and time enough to appreciate the ever-changing sights and sounds of a journey. A journey by train also has a special charm about it. Lakes and forests and wild, open plains sweeping past your carriage window create a grand view in which time and distance mean nothing. On board a plane, however, there is just the blank blue of the sky filling the narrow window of the airplane. The soft lighting, in-flight films and gentle music make up the only world you know, and the hours progress slowly.
Then there is the time spent being ""processed"" at a modern airport. People are conveyed like robots along walkways; baggage is weighed, tickets produced, examined and produced yet again before the passengers move to another waiting area. Journeys by rail and sea take longer, yes, but the hours devoted to being ""processed"" at departure and arrival in airports are luckily absent. No wonder, then, that the modern high-speed trains are winning back passengers from the airlines.
Man, however, is now a world traveler and cannot turn his back on the airplane. The working lives of too many people depend upon it; whole new industries have been built around its design and operation. The holiday maker, too, with limited time to spend, patiently endures the busy airports and limited space of the flight to gain those extra hours and even days, relaxing in the sun. speed controls people's lives; time saved, in work or play, is the important thing--or so we are told. Perhaps those first horsemen, riding free across the wild, open plains, were enjoying a better world than the one we know today. They could travel at will, and the clock was not their master. 
 Question:What is the main idea of the passage? 
A. Air travel benefits people and industries. 
B. Train Travel has some advantages over air travel. 
C. Great changes have taken place in modern travel. 
D. The high speed of air travel is gained at a cost.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair.

A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.

Context: September 21, 2050----At a press conference today it was announced that the first tourist heading for Mars will be the 38-year-old US businessman Patrick Clifford. He will leave the earth in the  launching window of June 2052 and set his foot on the surface of Mars in November, together with the other 6 astronauts assigned for the mission to further explore the planet.
Patrick has now two years of training ahead of him to get ready for the trip. Not only will he spend five months in getting to Mars, but another 600 days there before he can go back home.  Patrick was of course very excited, "" This has been my dream since I was four, and seeing the first man on Mars 20 years ago made me realize that it was possible.""
To be able to pay the $ 1. 3 billion for his ticket for the trip Patrick sold his majority stake   in the company his father had built. ""I know that my father would have been proud of me if he had still been alive today, he knew what this means to me"", says Patrick. _ but it is said that he was paid twice as much for his part of the company.
So, how is he going to spend his 600 days on the red planet? ""Well, since I don't have a job when I get back after selling the company, I have plenty of time to come up with a new business idea"", he says and laughs. If he brings a shovel he can start building the first hotel there, but maybe he shouldn't expect too many guests until someone can offer a cheaper ticket. 
 Question:What can be inferred from the passage? 
A. Patrick is an optimistic man 
B. A total of six people will go to Mars 
C. Patrick's father felt excited at the news 
D. Patrick will spend all his money on the trip

Context: I have had just about enough of being treated like a second-class citizen, simply because I happen to be that unfairly treated member of society --- a customer. The more I go into shops and hotels, banks and post offices, railway stations, airports and the like, the more I am convinced the things are being run merely to suit the firm, the system, or the union. There seems to be a deceptive   new motto for so-called ""service"" organizations --- Staff Before Service.
How often, for example, have you queued for what seems like hours at the Post Office or the supermarket because there was not enough staff on duty to manage all the service grilles or checkout counters? Surely in these days of high unemployment it must be possible to hire cashiers and counter staff. Yet supermarkets, hinting darkly at higher prices, claim that uncovering all their cash registers at any one time would increase operating costs. And the Post Office says we cannot expect all their service grilles to be occupied ""at times when demand is low"".
It is the same with hotels. Because waiters and kitchen staff must finish when it suits them, dining rooms close earlier or menu choice is cut short. As for us guests, we just have to put up with it. There is also the nonsense of so many friendly hotel night porters having been thrown out of their jobs in the interests of ""efficiency"" and replaced by coin-eating machines which offer everything. Not to mention the tea-making kit in your room a kettle with a mixed collection of tea bags, plastic milk boxes and lump sugar. Who wants to wake up to a raw teabag? I do not, especially when I am paying for ""service"".
Can it be stopped, this worsening of service, this growing attitude that the customer is always a trouble? I angrily hope so because it is happening, sadly, in all walks of life.
Our only hope is to hammer home our anger whenever and wherever we can and, if all else fails, bring back into practice that other, older slogan --- Take Our Deal Elsewhere.

Context: Like a growing number of young women in Vietnam's northern part city of Haiphong, Pham Thi Hue was infected with HIV by her husband, one of the town's many drug users. But instead of being shamed into silence, as Vietnamese with HIV and AIDS are, the 25-year-old tailor and mother of one went public, appearing on television and at conferences. Her business suffered and her neighbors insulted  her, but Hue has now become the public face of Mothers and Wives, an HIV/ AIDS support group established in Haiphong by a Norwegian nongovernmental organization and her neighborhood's People's Committee. Last year, she founded a smaller group named after a local flower. People who need advice on treatment or help preparing bodies for burial can dial a hot line and get assistance from able and sympathetic HIV victims. ""We gather to support each other,"" Hue says. ""When we are sick, what we need most is encouragement and comfort from people who understand our situation and are willing to share our happiness, as well as our sadness.""
On a hot and damp night last month, Hue welcomed into her small home a very thin woman, also a tailor, who was HIV positive. The woman tearfully told Hue that she had not told anyone about her condition, fearing that she would lose customers and that her daughter would be insulted at school. Hue became the wise elder, offering medical and personal advice. 
 Question:From the passage we can learn that Pham Thi Hue is a woman who is  _  . 
A. weak and kind

Context: Tu Youyou, 84, honored with the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Oct 5, 2015. She was the first Chinese citizen to win a Nobel Prize in science for her work in helping to create an anti-malaria  medicine.
In 1967, Communist leader Mao Zedong decided there was an urgent national need to find a cure for malaria. At the time, malaria spread by mosquitoes was killing Chinese soldiers fighting Americans in the jungles of northern Vietnam. A secret research unit was formed to find a cure for the illness. Two years later, Tu Youyou was instructed to become the new head of Mission 523. Researchers in Mission523 _ ancient books to find historical methods of fighting malaria. When she started her search for an anti-malarial drug, over 240,000 compounds  around the world had already been tested, without any success.
Finally, the team found a brief reference to one substance, sweet wormwood , which had been used to treat malaria in China around 400 AD. The team isolated one active compound in wormwood, artemisinin , which appeared to battle malaria-friendly parasites . The team then tested extracts  of the compound but nothing was effective until Tu Youyou returned to the original ancient text. After another careful reading, she improved the drug recipe one final time, heating the extract without allowing it to reach boiling point.
After the drug showed promising results in mice and monkeys, Tu volunteered to be the first human recipient of the new drug. ""As the head of the research group, I had the responsibility."" she explained. 
 Question:Which of the following words can best describe Tu Youyou? 
A. Responsible 
B. Traditional 
C. Stubborn 
D. Lucky

Context: When you buy a T-shirt, or a fur coat in a store, it often carries a label telling who made it or from what store it was bought. Instead, some labels show the dress is famous and it is very expensive, so buyers secretly wish they could be carried forever. On the other hand, buyers who deal with the cheapest products would be pleased to be away with labels  _ .
However, there is another label more important than the one showing from which store the dress was bought. When a person buys a fur coat, or a jacket from a store, a label telling what the product is made of should be carried to it.
The label is required by law. Besides telling what the product on show is made of, the label should be in clear English and be where one can find it easily. The information on the label must be true.
The reason for this is that most buyers today aren't expert enough to know exactly what kind of fur or material they are buying. The buyers must believe in the store that sells the products or in what the label says. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE? 
A. A T-shirt seldom carries a label. 
B. A fur coat with a high price often carries a false label. 
C. A label only says what material the product is made of. 
D. Not all buyers know the materials they are buying. 
 Answer: D
Context: Local businessmen are increasingly facing competition from on line retailers. Larry Pollock, owner of Camera Co/Op on South Congress, said he has been dealing with this kind of problem for years, even before the Internet. The struggle began with mail-order catalogues, which are similar to online retailers in that they have few employees to pay, no sales tax fees and no business venue to lease and manage.
""Their overhead is lower, but they don't offer a service like we do,"" Pollock said.
Pollock, however, said providing a valuable service to customers does not always guarantee continued sales.
""We spend 30 minutes to an hour with somebody and they go home and buy it online,"" he said.
According to the state comptroller's office, online shopping is developing at a more rapid rate than traditional businesses.
In spite of how fair or unfair online shopping may be to the local businessmen, consumers will continue to turn to the Internet for its variety and accessibility, said Mitch Wilson, an online shopper. ""You have a larger selection and it's easier to compare prices.""
 Wilson said he built his personal computer and paid a third of the price by shopping online.
""Before the Internet, I would have had to go and buy an assembled computer from somebody like Dell,"" he said. ""Before I started shopping online I could never find all the pieces I wanted. No single store had everything needed, so shopping online saved me from having to buy from Dell.""
Janny Brazeal, a psychology freshman, said online shopping is too impersonal.

 Question:Mitch Wilson prefers to build his personal computer by shopping on line because   _  . 
A. he can easily get what he needs at a lower price 
B. he can not get the price at traditional businessman 
C. he is not satisfied with the service of local businessman 
D. the quality of Dell is not satisfying 
 Answer: A
Context: Local businessmen are increasingly facing competition from on line retailers. Larry Pollock, owner of Camera Co/Op on South Congress, said he has been dealing with this kind of problem for years, even before the Internet. The struggle began with mail-order catalogues, which are similar to online retailers in that they have few employees to pay, no sales tax fees and no business venue to lease and manage.
""Their overhead is lower, but they don't offer a service like we do,"" Pollock said.
Pollock, however, said providing a valuable service to customers does not always guarantee continued sales.
""We spend 30 minutes to an hour with somebody and they go home and buy it online,"" he said.
According to the state comptroller's office, online shopping is developing at a more rapid rate than traditional businesses.
In spite of how fair or unfair online shopping may be to the local businessmen, consumers will continue to turn to the Internet for its variety and accessibility, said Mitch Wilson, an online shopper. ""You have a larger selection and it's easier to compare prices.""
 Wilson said he built his personal computer and paid a third of the price by shopping online.
""Before the Internet, I would have had to go and buy an assembled computer from somebody like Dell,"" he said. ""Before I started shopping online I could never find all the pieces I wanted. No single store had everything needed, so shopping online saved me from having to buy from Dell.""
Janny Brazeal, a psychology freshman, said online shopping is too impersonal.
""I'd rather see it in person, touch it, know that I'm getting it,"" she said.
Brazeal also said she would not give out her credit card number or other personal information online no matter how safe the site claims it is. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the following is wrong? 
A. Traditional business can provide valuable services to customers 
B. People can get cheaper goods from traditional business 
C. More and more people will turn to the Internet for their needs 
D. There are still many people who don't like on-line shopping 
 Answer: B
Context: Consumers are being confused and misled by the hodge-podge  of environmental claims made by household products, according to a ""green labeling"" study published by Consumers International Friday.
Among the report's more unacceptalbe findings - a German fertilizer described itself as ""earthworm friendly""; a brand of flour said it was ""non-polluting"" and a British toilet paper claimed to be ""environmentally friendlier"".
The study was written and researched by Britain's National Consumer Council (NCC) for lobby group Consumers International. It was funded by the German and Dutch governments and the European Commission.
""While many good and useful claims are being made, it is clear that there is a long way to go in ensuring shoppers are adequately informed about the environmental impacts they buy,"" said Consumers International director, Anna Fielder.
The 10-country study surveyed product packaging in Britain, Western Europe, Scandinavia and the United States. It found that products sold in Germany and the United Kingdom made the most environmental claims on average.
The report focused on claims made by specific products, such as detergent  , insect sprays and some garden products. It did not test claims, but compared them to labeling guidelines set by the International Standards Organization (ISO) in September, 1999. Researchers documented claims of environmental friendliness made by about 2,000 products and found many too vague or too misleading to meet ISO standards.
""Many products had specially designed labels to make them seem environmentally friendly, but in fact many of these symbols mean nothing,"" said report researcher Philip Page.
""Laundry detergents made the most number of claims with 158. Household cleaners were second with 145 separate claims, while paints were third on our list with 73. The high numbers show how confusing it must be for consumers to sort the true from the misleading,"" he said.
The ISO labeling standards ban vague or misleading claims on product packaging, because terms such as ""environmentally friendly"" and ""non-polluting"" cannot be verified. ""What we are now pushing for is to have multinational corporations meet the standards set by the ISO,"" said Page. 
 Question:According to the passage, the NCC found it unacceptable that   _  . 
A. all the products surveyed claim to meet ISO standards 
B. the claims made by products are often unclear and deceiving 
C. consumers would believe many of the manufacturers' claims 
D. few products actually prove to be environment friendly

Context: The Netherlands is a small country on the North Sea. From any place in the country, the farthest point is never more than 350 kilometers away. It takes only a little more than four hours to travel by train from Vlissingen, in the southwest, to Groningen, in the northeast.
More than 16 million people live there. Most of the people in the Netherlands live in the west of the country. The four largest cities, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Utrecht, are there. Amsterdam is the capital, but The Hague is the seat of govemment.
The Netherlands is sometimes called Holland, because an area in the west of the Netherlands used to be called Holland. The name lives on in the names of two Dutch provinces: North Holland and South Holland. The language spoken in the Netherlands is Dutch. In the province of Friesland, Frisian is also spoken. That is a separate  ( )  language, which is a little bit like English.

Context: It's hard not to feel cheated and over-charged when you receive unexpected roaming   charges while traveling abroad--whether they come from making phone calls or checking e-mails.
Jeff Gardner received an $ 11,000 bill from Verizon after spending four days in Jamaica. Before the trip, Mr. Gardner, who runs a fly-fishing business in Grayling, Michigan, said he called Verizon to find out what it would cost to use his cellphone for calls and his wireless card to check e-mails while in Jamaica. He said he was told that calls would be about $ 2 a minute and that there would be no extra charges for data as he was on an unlimited plan. _ .
""I don't mind paying a fair amount for fair service, but $11,000 for four days is ridiculous,"" said Mr. Gardner, who used his phone carefully and economically on the trip. He also tried to check and send e-mails using his wireless card, but quickly gave up after the e-mails didn't go through. Still, his Verizon bill said more than 500,000 kilobytes   of data was delivered while he was in Jamaica, an amount Mr. Gardner said is 100 times what he normally uses in a month.
As travelers increasingly use smart phones abroad in the same way they do at home--to check e-mails, update Facebook and Twitter and pull up online maps--many are facing costly roaming fees, which providers charge when customers use their phones outside their service area. In fact, roaming charges have gotten so out of hand that the Federal Communications Commission has proposed a plan that would require wireless companies to send their customers a voice or text message when they are approaching their plan's limit, when they have reached that limit and when they are starting to result in roaming fees. 
 Question:Why did Jeff Gardner call Verizon before his trip to Jamaica? 
A. To hand over his business. 
B. To check his cellphone bill 
C. To find out information about Jamaica. 
D. To find out information about roaming charges.

Context: Batteries are included, but the charger's not. The Nokia E-Cu concept phone doesn't need to plug in, it charges from any heat source. Designer Patrick Hyland says it can even work off the warmth of your pocket. The first time ""it would take approximately seven hours to reach full charge, then after that it's continuously charging by keeping the phone in areas between 86 degrees and 104 degrees Fahrenheit."" That's one hot pocket.?
He's put a thermogenerator  inside the phone that transforms heat into electric potential energy. To better conduct the heat to that little power plant in your pocket, the E-Cu (E for energy, Cu for copper) is coated by copper backing with heat sinks like those normally used to keep electronics from overheating.
Nokia doesn't have current plans to build the phone, so for now it remains a concept. But Hyland says he's open to anyone who wants to cooperate.
For Americans this technology would certainly be convenient. It would also save a bit on energy bills and waste. ""Annually, unwanted phone chargers produce 51,000 tons of waste in addition to the greenhouse gases created by the production of the electricity needed to charge them,"" Hyland says. So a charger-free phone is also a green phone. Though adapting our plug in habits would help a group of people, most cell phone related energy use comes from leaving your charger plugged in all day unnecessarily.
The real potential for charger-free cell phone technology is what it could enable places where plugging in isn't an option, like rural areas in the developing world.
Cell phones are spreading faster than power lines and bringing with them countless opportunities, aid and health advances. A phone like the E-Cu, if it ever comes to be, would enable all manner of expanded aid and development by phone projects. Let's hope Patrick finds a partner.

Context: Every day from the time we wake up until the time we go to bed, we are bombarded with information from all sides, from TV, radio, newspapers and books; from family, friends, and colleagues. As a new cable television subscriber, I am  ly amazed at the quantity and varying levels of information quality on cable television. Including the networks, there are eight TV ""news"" organizations vying to provide us with all the information we can possibly absorb. Newspaper, magazines, books, radio, the Internet, email, snail mail, and the telephone all compete for our attention and our minds. At the office conversations around the water cooler and coffee maker serve to spread even more items of information.
  There is valuable information out there about the world we live in, on topics as varied as health, safety, traffic, nutrition, business, finance, philosophy, nature, science, weather, history and the human condition. There is also a large amount of misleading and outright false information, not just on controversial subjects such as politics and religion but on any topic one can think of, including all of the topics mentioned above.
  With all this information coming at us from all directions, how does one sift through it all to sort out the facts from the fiction, the truth from the lies, the more important from the less important? Should we turn off the TV, cancel our newspaper subscriptions, disconnect our phones and modems to become information ""hermits""? Probably not.
  A better method of sifting through the information wave without being overwhelmed and confused is to become a skeptical inquirer-or skeptic-with regard to the surrounding world. By ""skeptic""-I do not mean a cynic-a person who rejects new ideas simply because they are new. A skeptic is one who questions the validity of a particular claim by calling for evidence to prove or disprove it. Skepticism is a method, not a position. It is a provisional approach to all factual claims. In terms of processing information, a skeptic needs to be able to grasp reality and acquire knowledge about the environment that agrees with reason, logic, and evidence. In other words, as skeptics, when we hear a claim that may or may not be fantastic, we should say, ""That's nice, prove it."" 
 Question:When faced with an incredible or fantastic claim, what shall we do according to the author? 
A. Ask questions and look for proof. 
B. Ignore the information and its source. 
C. Change the subject immediately. 
D. Try to consult an expert who knows the truth. 
 Answer: A
Context: A company advertised in the newspaper for a sales position. Details of the prerequisite  , salary and benefits were given. It was also clearly stated that applicants needed to take an aptitude test   and an interview. However, looking at the whole advertisement, one could not find any contact information of the company.
Most interested applicants thought that it was the company's HR department's carelessness or a printing error. They therefore waited patiently for the newspaper to publish an amendment. But instead of waiting for the newspaper to publish the company details, another three applicants took the initiative to find out the company's contact information themselves.
Tim did a search on the Internet. By typing the company's name, he easily obtained all the information including its contact number. Lisa called up the local telephone number search service and found out the company's office number. She called up the office and got the required contact information. Donna put in a greater effort in her search. She remembered seeing a poster by the same company in the city so she drove all the way down and made a few rounds to search for it. She finally found it together with the company's contact information.
Three days after that advertisement was published in the newspaper, most interested applicants were still waiting eagerly for an amendment. On the other hand, the application letters and resumes of Tim, Lisa and Donna had already reached the hands of the company's HR manager. They were then called up for an interview. During the interview, all went well and immediately they were hired. The three of them were a little surprised at how fast things went on. They were expecting for an aptitude test as stated in the advertisement. The HR director answered them, smiling, ""Our test is hidden in the advertisement itself. To be a good salesperson in this age, he or she has to be broad-minded and very importantly, does not follow rigid   steps or rules. You are all clever and agile. In a short time, you've managed to find ways of contacting us. It shows clearly that you have passed the test with flying colors!""
The fools sit around waiting for their chances whereas the wise actively take actions with great initiative   . 
 Question:The writer wants to tell us through this passage that   _  . 
A. no contact information seen in an advertisement might not be the company's mistake 
B. applicants should be careful not to be fooled by the company's advertisement 
C. opportunity always belongs to whoever is active and broad-minded 
D. there are many successful chances to be found in this age

Context: Tobacco companies are fighting efforts in the United States and Australia to make their products less appealing. In Washington, a federal judge last week blocked the Food and Drug Administration from requiring new warning labels on cigarette packs. Judge Richard Leon ruled in a case brought by five tobacco companies. The judge temporarily stopped a new federal rule which requires large new warnings starting next September. These include color1 images such as a dead body or diseased lungs. And simple text warnings now appear.
Congress called for color1 images showing the dangers of smoking, similar to what Canada does. But the tobacco companies say the new requirements approved in June violate   their free speech rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Judge Leon said the FDA could not require the new labels before a lawsuit  against the government is decided. Some experts say the process could take years. The judge said he believed the cigarette makers were highly likely to win their case.
He said the images should be designed to appeal to emotions, rejecting government arguments that they should be purely factual. He accused the government of trying to use the labels to promote an ""obvious anti-smoking agenda?""
The head of an anti-smoking group, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the decision ""wrong on the science and wrong on the law"".
About one-fifth of American adults smoke. The World Health Organization says tobacco kills nearly six mil-lion people worldwide each year. More than six hundred thousand of them are non-smokers who breathe other people's tobacco smoke.
In Australia, tobacco companies want to stop what would be the world's most restrictive laws on cigarette advertising. Cigarettes could be sold only in plain olive-green packages. Only the brand name and health warnings could appear. The Senate passed the bill last week and sent it back to the Lower House to approve minor amendments  . The law is to go into effect in December of next year.
Tobacco companies Say the legislation   violates the Australian constitution. They say it would unjustly reduce the value of their brand names and trademarks. Health Minister Nicola Roxon says the government is ready for a legal fight. 
 Question:What are the tobacco companies ii1 the United States and Australia fighting against? 
A. The requirements to sell fewer products to the public. 
B. The requirements to print new warning labels on their products. 
C. The measures to make their products more attractive. 
D. The ways to make the companies close their business.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

 Answer: C
Context: Paris
Passengers carried per day: 4.4m
Cost of ticket: 80p flat fare
Length: 131 miles    Lines: 14   Stations: 297
In Paris there are pleasures for those who use the Metro  -- many of them artistic. The graceful Art Nouveau dragon-fly entrances are just the most noticeable on a Metro system which celebrated its 100thanniversary by spending 30 million francs (PS2.9million) on making its stations works of art. On my way home I pass Bonne Nouvelle station in the heart of Paris's cinema district. There, during the cinema festival this summer, special lighting effects dot the platforms and films are projected onto the large advertising boards.
More than anything the metro is efficient. ""When I worked on line 4"", says a retired driver, ""we had exactly 30 minutes and 15 seconds to complete the journey. If it took any longer, they cut our pay."" But there are problems. Many Metro stations have too many stairs, and changing lines at big interchanges  can be tiresome.
Moscow
Passengers carried per day: 9m
Cost of ticket: 12p
Length: 164 miles    Lines: 11   Stations: 162
The first underground passage for the Moscow Metropolitan started in 1932. Three years later the trains started running. They haven't stopped since-- every 90 seconds or two minutes during rush hour, every five minutes the rest of the time, from 6 a.m. till 1 a. m. There may be a crowd of people but there is seldom a wait.
The trains take you through spacious and spotless stations. For tourists it's a major sightseeing attraction: from Russian Art Deco to neo-classical, the Metro stations are not to be missed.
Tokyo
Passengers carried per day: 7m
Cost of ticket: 90p ~ PS1.68
Length: 177 miles    Lines: 12   Stations: 209
Trains do not just arrive on time in Tokyo. They stop right on the platform mark so that passengers can line up knowing exactly where the doors will open. Train driving is a respectful job for life, for which the applicants must pass a strict screening of health checks, interviews and written exams before they can put on the enviable uniform, cap and white gloves.
However, overcrowding means it is far from perfect. At rush hours, some stations employ part-time platform staff to push in passengers. Carriages can be filled to 184% of capacity . The main reason for such conditions is that the Tokyo subway station system has only 15 miles of track for every 1 million people, compared to 36 on the London Underground. New lines are under construction, but at a cost of PS500,000 per meter of rail. Progress has been slow.
Mexico City
Passengers carried per day: 4.2m
Cost of ticket: 11p flat fare
Length: 99 miles    Lines: 11   Stations: 175
Fast, relatively safe, and very cheap, Mexico City's underground is an ideal place of order and efficiency compared to the disorders above. The Mexican capital's underground system is the biggest in the continent and one of the most subsidized   networks in the world.
The first trains leave the station at 5 a.m. and the last after midnight as the crowd move from the outskirts of the 20 million-strong megacity  . Mexico City's Metro also attracts a sizeable group of passengers who are unwilling to spend hours in traffic jams. There is a master plan to build new lines and extend existing one, but financial constraints   complicated by the fact that the system runs through different jurisdicitons   mean progress is slow. 
 Question:Metro rail drivers in Paris must  _  . 
A. keep to the train schedule strictly 
B. complete the journey gracefully 
C. stop right on the platform mark 
D. understand the special lighting 
 Answer: A
Context: Have you ever imagined what kind of car we will be driving in 2020? It will be rather different from the type we know today, with the next 20 years bringing greater change than the past 50. The people who will be designing the models of tomorrow believe that environmental problems may well accelerate(,)the pace of the car's development. Today they are students on the transport design course at London's Royal College of Art.
Their vision is of a machine with three wheels instead of four, electrically powered, environmentally clean, and able to drive itself along ""intelligent"" roads equipped with built-in power supplies. Future cars will pick up their fuel during long journeys from a power source built into the road, or store it in small quantities for traveling in the city.
Instead of today's seating arrangements--two in front, two or three behind, all facing forward--the 2010 car will have a versatile interior with adults and children in a family circle.
This view of the future car is based on a much more sophisticated road system,  _ Cars will not need drivers, because computers will provide safe driving control and route finding. All the driver will have to do is to say where to go and the computer will do the rest. It will become impossible for cars to crash into one another. The technology already exists for the car to become a true automobile. 
 Question:What is the main idea of the text? 
A. Future cars will be completely different from the automobiles we know today. 
B. The design of future cars will be more sophisticated. 
C. Because of the new type of cars, our future environment will become cleaner. 
D. The road system will become more sophisticated than it is today.

The next day in Center Market, the people would buy it at a much higher price. But Bob wouldn't sell it.
The third day, Bob took the stone to Street Market. This time, the people there offered a price which was ten times higher than that in Green Market. But Bob wouldn't sell it.
Bob couldn't understand. He asked Mr. White, "" Why did they pay me so much money for just a stone?""

Context: David hated spending money. When he had to buy something in a shop, he always tried his best to knock down the price, even for the cheapest things. If he wanted to buy a bottle of orange, for example, and the shopkeeper asked for $2, David would say, ""Make it $1.90 and I'll buy it."" Sometimes the shopkeepers agreed to _ their prices a little. ""What's ten cents?"" they asked themselves. ""If it makes this man happy, it won't hurt me very much."" In this way David saved a few cents here and a few cents there, and by the end of the year he had saved several hundred dollars.
One day he had a very bad toothache and had to go to the dentist. The dentist looked at the tooth and said, ""This tooth will have to come out. It's too serious to save."" ""How much must I pay you to take out a tooth?"" David asked. ""Forty dollars,"" the dentist said. ""How long will it take you to pull out the tooth?"" he asked. ""About two minutes,"" the dentist answered. ""Forty dollars for two minutes' work!"" he shouted, ""That's robbery  ."" The dentist smiled. ""You're right,"" she said. ""Thank you for telling me. I'll pull your tooth out very slowly. How about if I take half an hour?"" 
 Question:After the dentist answered David's question, he became very   _  . 
A. angry 
B. sad

 Answer: A
Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT."" 
 Question:The price of the knives was cut down by half because   _  . 
A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap 
D. the knives were produced in one factory

A week later the general heard that his teeth were being sold in curiosity shops as $ 5 each. On each of the teeth there was a label with the name of the general and words: ""Buy these teeth and show them to your friends at home."" The general got angry. He rushed to his office and ordered six officers to go around the city and buy all his teeth.
The officers went out and visited every curiosity shop in the capital. They were away from the office all day. In the evening they returned and put on the table in front of the general the teeth they had bought. They had collected 175 teeth.

Based on the question, the option and the context select the most appropriate answer from the provided choices ""A."", ""B."", ""C."" and ""D."".
Context: The health-care economy is filled with unusual and even unique economic relationships. One of the least understood involves the peculiar roles of producer or ""provider"" and purchaser or ""consumer"" in the typical doctor-patient relationship. In most sectors of the economy, it is the seller who attempts to attract a potential buyer with various appealing factors of price, quality, and use, and it is the buyer who makes the decision. Such condition, however, is not common in most of the health-care industry.
In the health-care industry, the doctor-patient relationship is the mirror image of the ordinary relationship between producer and consumer. Once an individual has chosen to see a physician -- and even then there may be no real choice -- it is the physician who usually makes all significant purchasing decisions: whether the patient should return ""next Wednesday"", whether X-rays are needed, whether drugs should be prescribed, etc. It is rare that a patient will challenge such professional decisions or raise in advance questions about price, especially when the disease is regarded as serious.
This is particularly significant in relation to hospital care. The physician must certify the need for hospitalization, determine what procedures will be performed, and announce when the patient may be discharged. The patient may be consulted about some of the decisions, but in general it is the doctor's judgments that are final. Little wonder then that in the eye of the hospital it is the physician who is the real ""consumer"". As a consequence, the medical staff represents the ""power center"" in hospital policy and decision-making, not the administration.
Although usually there are in this situation four identifiable participants-- the physician, the hospital, the patient, and the payer (generally an insurance carrier or government)-- the physician makes the essential decisions for all of them. The hospital becomes an extension of the physician; the payer generally meets most of the bills generated by the physician/hospital, and for the most part the patient plays a passive role. We estimate that about 75-80 percent of health-care choices are determined by physicians, not patients. For this reason, the economy directed at patients or the general is relatively ineffective. 
 Question:The author's primary purpose in writing this passage is to   _  . 
A. urge hospitals to reclaim their decision-making authority 
B. inform potential patients of their health-care rights 
C. criticize doctors for exercising too much control over patients 
D. analyze some important economic factors in health-care 
 Answer: D

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle.

 Your twelve thousand 'Smart' watches were received by our company this morning. However, we wish to make a number of complaints concerning the serious delay in delivery and your failure to carry out our instructions regard to this order.
It was firmly pointed out from the beginning that the delivery date had to be less than six weeks from the original order in order to satisfy our own customers' requirements. While we understand that delays in production are occasionally unavoidable, we must point out that the major reason why the order was placed with your company was that we were assured by you of its simplicity, and that your existing stocks were sufficiently high to ensure immediate shipment. Late delivery of the goods has caused us to disappoint several of our most valued customers, and will have an unfavorable effect on future orders.
The second complaint concerns the difference in colour between the watches we ordered and those delivered. It was stated clearly in the order that watches in combinations of green/purple and orange/purple only were required. However, only half the watches in the delivery received are of the colours specified. Our Hong Kong agent informed you of the importance of following our instructions exactly, since we consider there to be only a limited market in this country for watches of other color1s at the present time. Any watches that are not of the specified colours will, of course, be returned to you.
We are also somewhat concerned about the rather poor quality of the goods received, since it is obvious that the watches that finally arrived have been made from not good enough materials and have been produced to a lower standard than those in the sample. We have also found that a number of the watches do not appear to be working. Whether the latter problem is due to poor production, or damage in transportation is not yet clear, but we should like to point out that we feel this matter to be entirely your fault.
As a result of the above problems, therefore, we feel that the most suitable course of action is to return to you unpaid any of the goods considered unsatisfactory. We shall also, of course, be forced to reconsider whether any further orders should be placed with your company.
We look forward to your early reply.
Yours sincerely,
John Smith

 Answer: B
Context: Trying to recover from a devastating economic crisis, Spain is considering moving the country's clock back by one hour.
Many people regard long afternoon naps and late dinners as perfect aspects of the Spanish way of life. Until the 1940s, Spain was on the same time as Britain and Portugal. In World War II, Spain and Portugal moved the clocks forward to align them with Nazi Germany. The same happened in Portugal. After the defeat of Hitler, Portugal returned to Greenwich Mean Time, but Spain did not.
""The fact that for more than 71 years Spain has not been in its proper time zone means we sleep almost an hour less than the World Health Organization recommends,"" lawmakers in the Spanish Parliament wrote in a proposal.""This has a negative effect on productivity, absenteeism, stress, accidents and school drop-out rates.""
Last September, a parliamentary commission recommended that the government turn back the clocks by one hour and introduce a regular eight-hour workday. For the time being, the Spanish government is treating the campaign seriously but it hasn't taken any action yet.
Spain's time zone issue explains why everything in Spain happens later, from meal times to broadcast entertainment (primetime doesn't start until 10 pm). Many urban Spaniards complain of a never-ending workday that begins in the morning but is interrupted by a traditional late-morning break and then again by the midday siesta--a two-hour long lunch and nap that usually start at 2 pm. If workers return to their desks at 4 pm, they end up working late into the evening.
Under the proposed new schedule, the lunchtime break would be cut to an hour or less. The interruption-filled Spanish workday would be replaced by something closer to a 9-to-5 schedule. Ignacio Buqueras, president of the Association for the Rationalization of Spanish Working Hours, told The New York Times that changing the Spanish schedule would be good news for working mothers. It would also allow families more free time together and boost Spain's economic recovery.
Maria Angles Duran, a sociologist with the Spanish National Research Council, is skeptical that changing the time zone will reverse low productivity, which she attributes more to the structure of the service-oriented economy. But she agreed that a more normal work schedule would help women, who often complain that their husbands deliberately schedule meetings in the early evening.
""For men, this is perfect,"" Duran said, ""They arrive home and the children have already had their baths! Timetables can be used as a sort of weapon."" 
 Question:According to the passage, Duran may agree with the following except that   _  . 
A. the new schedule will allow families more free time 
B. women will probably benefit from the new schedule 
C. economic structure influences economic performance 
D. men can escape housework in the existing schedule

         After the long winter, the farmers finally began planting their fields. This made the birds very glad, for now there would be millions of seeds  to steal! While some of the birds were careful, the cranes   were daring ; they stole seeds from right under the farmers' noses. The cranes considered stealing is fun, and that morning they asked a simple-minded stork   to come along for the fun.
         The stork went along, not knowing what the cranes were up to. But the party ended unexpectedly when the birds all got caught in the trap  of the farmer's net, who had set the trap for just that purpose.
         When the farmer discovered the birds in his trap, the stork asked for mercy  .
         ""Please, Farmer, sir, I am a stork. I come from a good family that is honest and true. I went along with the cranes, but I had no idea they were going to steal from you,"" the bird said.

Context: My summer hols wr CWOT. B4, we usd 2 go 2 NY 2C my bro, his CF & thr 3:-@ kids FTF ILNY, its gr8.
Can you understand this sentence? If you can't, don't feel too bad: neither could the middle school teacher in England who received this as homework. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cellphones. To newcomers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the ""translation"" of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York; it's great.
Schoolteachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes cxan be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted .
Everyone should just relax, say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nunberg, from Stanford University, agrees. ""People get better at writing by writing,"" he says, ""Kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mail, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than, their parents.""
Linguist James Millroy says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can bet your bottom dollar that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents, they too will think this way. Milroy argues that languages do not and cannot become ""corrupted""; they simply change to meet the new needs.
However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write Standard English. Cynthia McVey says, ""I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but that learning to write proper English is a must for their future.""
Perhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway. Erin, age 12, says, ""I wouldn't use text language in my homework. Texting is just for fun"" 
 Question:Which of the following is true according to the passage? 
A. Cynthia McVey points out teenagers can deal with Netspeak properly. 
B. Geoffrey Nunberg believes Netspeakers can write Standard English. 
C. David Crystal thinks Netspeak helps develop the habit of writing. 
D. James Milroy says that language is changing and improving. 
 Answer: C
Context: The advantages of an international language in the modern world are obvious. Thanks to modern methods of transport, we can travel everywhere more easily and more quickly than ever before, but the language problem still remains. Without a common language, there may be misunderstandings between people of different countries. There are two possible solutions to this problem: either we choose one of the main living languages of the world, or we make up an artificial  one. But neither solution is simple because no living language will be acceptable to everyone and because an artificial language, such as Esperanto, has no culture and would be thought boring by many learners.
It is often said that English is quickly becoming a world language. It is certainly the most widely used language in the world, and second only to Chinese in its number or native speakers, but there are certain worries of choosing English as an international language.
First of all, for political reasons and national pride, English is not acceptable to everyone as a world language. Many dislike its influence. English words enter their language and this often threats their own language. In France, a new word ""frangla is"" has been invented to describe the results. Although English is being taught in more and more schools abroad, the process is not always popular. Not every nation is prepared to accept the leading position of English in their education system 
 Question:The invention of the new French word ""franglais"" shows that   _  . 
A. French words enter the English language 
B. English words enter the French language 
C. the French language is becoming international 
D. the English language is becoming international

Context: John McCain and Barack Obama call for closer U.S.-Chinese cooperation on trade, the environment and nuclear proliferation  in the upcoming issue of an American business group's magazine. They do so in an unusual effort to  _ voters abroad.
Both articles appeared Sunday on the website of the American Chamber of Commerce  in China, and will be published in China Brief, the chamber's monthly magazine, on September 22.
Both stress that the countries should work more closely to ease trade friction , fight global warming, improve military exchanges, and block the spread of nuclear weapons to such countries as Iran and North Korea. 
""Cooperation on the key, enduring global challenges, such as climate change, can deepen understanding and enhance confidence. """"We also need to deepen high-level dialogues on a sustained basis on economic, security and global political issues"", said Obama in the article.
McCain agreed that the cooperation with prefix = st1 /Chinawould be essential in addressing issues of global concern. ""TheUnited Statesshares common interests withChinathat can form the basis of a strong partnership on issues of global concern, including climate change, trade and proliferation,"" he added. ""and I hope to see our relationship develop in a manner that benefits both countries and, in turn, the Asia-Pacific region and the world,"" he noted.
Both candidates  were impressed by China's economic success.
""Chinahas achieved extraordinary, sustained growth over the past three decades. Hundreds of millions of people inChinalive better now than most thought possible even two decades ago,"" Obama said.
""China's double-digit growth rates have brought hundreds of millions out of poverty, energized the economies of its neighbors and produced many new economic opportunities,"" McCain said.
Gao Wenhuan, 21st Century Online's special reporter, interviewed Marshall M. Bouton, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. ""My guess is, regardless of who is elected in November, you will hear basically the same description that Chinais a strategic partner and competitor,"" said Bouton.
A survey conducted by the Council in July 2008 found that the majority of respondents clearly admired China's accomplishments, but some Americans viewedChina's rising global power as a threat. According to the survey,Chinanow is seen as the most influential country in the world following theU.S.. 
 Question:This passage mainly talks about  _  . 
A. closer U.S.-Chinese cooperation

Context: Language has a powerful influence over people and their behaviour. This is especially true in the fields of advertising. Visual content and design in advertising have a very great impact on the consumers,but it is language that helps people to identify a product and keep it in mind. The choice of language to show specific messages with the intention of influencing people is of vital importance.
The English language is known for its extensive vocabulary. While many other languages have only one or two words to carry a particular meaning,English may have five or six. Moreover,the meanings of these five or six words may differ very slightly and in a very subtle  way. It is important to understand the connotation  of a word. ""Armchair"",for example,suggests comfort,whereas ""chair"" causes no particular feelings. Different people sometimes interpret language in different ways.
Both the mass media,when reporting news items,and marketing and advertising personnel have to consider the emotive power of the words they use. First,they make a decision about what to communicate and what to withhold .One way in which advertisers adapt language to their own use is to take compound words and use them as adjectives. Examples of these compounds are:top-quality,economysize,chocolateflavoured,featherlight and longerlasting. These compounds have become part of the English language.
The language of advertising always emphasizes  why one product stands out in comparison with the others. Don't expect advertising language to be always correct in the normal sense. For example,comparatives are often used when no real comparison is made. An advertisement for a detergent  may say ""It gets clothes whiter"",but whiter than what? 
 Question:When choosing words for their products,advertisers should consider  _  . 
A. whether the words are easy to remember 
B. what emotion the words can bring to people 
C. whether the words are popular and in fashion 
D. which group of people will be interested in them 
 Answer: B
Context: In 2007.five young people in the American state of Massachusetts developed an idea. The team knew that the world is filled with mobile phones.About eighty percent of all people are said to live within reach of a wireless telephone signal.    
    The idea was to use mobile phones and the Internet to connect job seekers with employers.The young people wrote a business plan and formed a company called Assured Labor.
    Assured Labor won a development competition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Three of the founders were graduate students there.    '
    Assured Labo is an electronic market place.It has two parts.One is for;the United States.That operation was launched in January in Boston.It links people with employees offering temporary jobs.
    The other arm of the business is for developing markets.That operation is meant to help people get mbfe permanent jobs.A representative is currently building partnerships with universities,and international companies in Central America.
    Assured Labor's president David Reich,says the companies now place job advertisements on radio or in newspapers.Some even drive around in cars with loudspeakers announcing that jobs are available.He says the companies are interested.in having more modem hiring practices.
    Through Assured Labor, companies will list open positions on the Internet.People who think
 they could do the job could reply by text messages or on their cellophanes.
    This is how the system works inprefix = st1 /Boston.
The jobs available include house cleaning.Dog walking and home repay.

Context: Writing one or two articles a day is a fair goal for a human writer. By contrast, the Wordsmith platform can produce up to 2,000 articles a second! Wordsmith is one example of natural language-generation software, often referred to as a robot journalist. To be fair, the software doesn't start from the beginning, like a human writer might. Instead, the software takes a set of structured data and transforms it into readable text.
Natural language-generation software, such as Wordsmith and Quill, does its work by identifying trends and highlights in sets of data. The software then searches its own dictionary for the words to express its findings.[:]
Why keep human writers around
Although this type of software writes faster than any human, it requires sets of structured data to work. That's why it's especially useful for writing earnings reports and other types of ""dry"" writing. Humans, on the other hand, are good at turning their unstructured thoughts directly into prose. The reports produced by Wordsmith and Quill read naturally, and they can match the tone of human writers. But for now, the robot journalists probably won't steal many jobs or win any Pulitzer Prizes! 
Current applications of natural language-generation software
Financial reports: The software is commonly used by banks or traders to analyze large amounts of financial data and then produce reports in plain English.
Health and fitness: The software can turn data gathered from wearable devices or fitness trackers into personalized reports. The writing tone can even be adjusted to sound more encouraging!
Sports reporting: The software is often used to turn real baseball, basketball and football statistics into exciting stories. 
 Question:Natural language-generation software can  _  . 
A. discover the world's focuses through the Internet 
B. write well enough to win Pulitzer Prizes 
C. produce articles in a tone similar to human's 
D. write such beautiful prose as human writers

Context: Consumers are being confused and misled by the hodge-podge  of environmental claims made by household products, according to a ""green labeling"" study published by Consumers International Friday.
Among the report's more unacceptalbe findings - a German fertilizer described itself as ""earthworm friendly""; a brand of flour said it was ""non-polluting"" and a British toilet paper claimed to be ""environmentally friendlier"".
The study was written and researched by Britain's National Consumer Council (NCC) for lobby group Consumers International. It was funded by the German and Dutch governments and the European Commission.
""While many good and useful claims are being made, it is clear that there is a long way to go in ensuring shoppers are adequately informed about the environmental impacts they buy,"" said Consumers International director, Anna Fielder.
The 10-country study surveyed product packaging in Britain, Western Europe, Scandinavia and the United States. It found that products sold in Germany and the United Kingdom made the most environmental claims on average.
The report focused on claims made by specific products, such as detergent  , insect sprays and some garden products. It did not test claims, but compared them to labeling guidelines set by the International Standards Organization (ISO) in September, 1999. Researchers documented claims of environmental friendliness made by about 2,000 products and found many too vague or too misleading to meet ISO standards.
""Many products had specially designed labels to make them seem environmentally friendly, but in fact many of these symbols mean nothing,"" said report researcher Philip Page.
""Laundry detergents made the most number of claims with 158. Household cleaners were second with 145 separate claims, while paints were third on our list with 73. The high numbers show how confusing it must be for consumers to sort the true from the misleading,"" he said.
The ISO labeling standards ban vague or misleading claims on product packaging, because terms such as ""environmentally friendly"" and ""non-polluting"" cannot be verified. ""What we are now pushing for is to have multinational corporations meet the standards set by the ISO,"" said Page. 
 Question:According to the passage, the NCC found it unacceptable that   _  . 
A. all the products surveyed claim to meet ISO standards 
B. the claims made by products are often unclear and deceiving 
C. consumers would believe many of the manufacturers' claims 
D. few products actually prove to be environment friendly 
 Answer: B
Context: There is a forgotten player in the global efforts to limit C02 emissions:the consumer. Households consume one--third of the final energy used in the European Union and produce around two--thirds of city waste.Moreover,food,housing,and private transport account for almost 80%of environmental pressures.So consumers can make a real difference when it comes to fighting climate change.
Several factors can direct consumers towards more environmentally--friendly behavior. To achieve this,we need clear and simple information to guide consumption decisions. Indeed.Two thirds of consumers find it difficult to understand which products are better for the environment when shopping.
 With 58% of Europeans believing that many companies pretend to be green in order to charge higher prices, industry has a long way to go in helping consumers feet confident when making green choices.They should give consumers more information about the carbon footprint of their products,and promote more sustainable behavior among their customers.
To be sure, companies are increasingly creating product labels that help consumers make responsible choices--for instance, reminding users of products made from materials that are recycled,renewable, and/or less carbon--intensive.  Even so,only,20%  of Europeans believe that companies are doing enough to promote environmentally friendly options.
In times of crisis, consumers prefer high-quality products that will last long and won't go out of style.Durable products might sometimes cost more, but they don't need to be replaced as frequently. In this way,companies that create durable or recyclable products enable consumers to think differently about their purchases, which can help users behave more responsibly, and thus may help end our ""throw-way"" culture.
However,  it is not enough to inform consumers of the environmental features of products. We also need to provide consumers with guidance to establish a practical lifestyle model to follow. This cannot be brought about by regulations alone, but by good business communities that would create a loyal group of ""sustainable consumers"". 
 Question:According to the passage, the key to going greener globally is  _  . 
A. to get the government involved in protecting the environment 
B. to require the companies produce environmentally-friendly products 
C. to encourage consumers to make their efforts to live a green way 
D. to provide enough information about sustainable products 
 Answer: C
Context: Language has a powerful influence over people and their behaviour. This is especially true in the fields of advertising. Visual content and design in advertising have a very great impact on the consumers,but it is language that helps people to identify a product and keep it in mind. The choice of language to show specific messages with the intention of influencing people is of vital importance.
The English language is known for its extensive vocabulary. While many other languages have only one or two words to carry a particular meaning,English may have five or six. Moreover,the meanings of these five or six words may differ very slightly and in a very subtle  way. It is important to understand the connotation  of a word. ""Armchair"",for example,suggests comfort,whereas ""chair"" causes no particular feelings. Different people sometimes interpret language in different ways.
Both the mass media,when reporting news items,and marketing and advertising personnel have to consider the emotive power of the words they use. First,they make a decision about what to communicate and what to withhold .One way in which advertisers adapt language to their own use is to take compound words and use them as adjectives. Examples of these compounds are:top-quality,economysize,chocolateflavoured,featherlight and longerlasting. These compounds have become part of the English language.
The language of advertising always emphasizes  why one product stands out in comparison with the others. Don't expect advertising language to be always correct in the normal sense. For example,comparatives are often used when no real comparison is made. An advertisement for a detergent  may say ""It gets clothes whiter"",but whiter than what? 
 Question:When choosing words for their products,advertisers should consider  _  . 
A. whether the words are easy to remember 
B. what emotion the words can bring to people 
C. whether the words are popular and in fashion 
D. which group of people will be interested in them 
 Answer: B
Context: For many years people in Estonia have been leaving their rubbish in the forests. Rainer Nolvak, a businessman and his friends wanted to clean up all the rubbish in Estonia. The rubbish was not just an environmental problem. It was a problem of people's attitudes. Rainer Nolvak got together with a team of 20 friends and they began to make a plan about how to clean up the rubbish. Soon, over 600 people joined in the group.
They named the project  Let's Do It! Estonia. The Ministry of the environment gave them some support. Many other companies joined in the group. Famous actors and singers also took part. Even the President of Estonia joined in. They sent information about Let's Do It! Estonia throughout the country.
Technology experts developed a special computer program. Team members went into the forests to find where the rubbish was. They used their mobile phones to mark every place where they found rubbish and send the information to the computer program. Then, the marked rubbish places appeared on the map. Anyone could go on the Internet and see the map.
The team found a surprising result. There were over 10,000 tons of waste in the forests of Estonia. When people saw how much waste was around their own homes, they were shocked. Thousands of people began to help. The team chose May 3, 2008 as the day to clean up the rubbish. On May 3, more than 50,000 people helped to get rid of the rubbish. They moved over 10,000 tons of rubbish in only one day!
    This was amazing for the environment in Estonia. But it was also an important step for Estonian society. Rainer Nolvak gave a speech at a conference in the Balkans. He said: ""The most important thing we did was build a team. It changed every one of us. We had to connect to people. We had to see that the rubbish was our problem. At times we are afraid of sharing. When we are together and there are many of us, we are not afraid.' 
 Question:What do we know about the project Let's Do It! Estonia? 
A. It was less successful than expected. 
B. It got great support from all over the country. 
C. It got money from famous actors and singers. 
D. It was set up by the Ministry of the Environment.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees 
 Answer: C
Context: For years I have been asked by several people how and why I came to translate a novel by Virginia Woolf in 1945. I graduated from the University of Ankara in 1941 and my four teachers, including Orphan Burian, are members of the Translation Bureau who prepared a list of works to be translated into Turkish and set themselves to translating some of these, besides shouldering the heavy work of correcting or editing the translations submitted to the Bureau. Orphan Burian, now mostly known for his translations of Shakespeare, had started to translate To the Lighthouse for the Translation Bureau, but at the same time he wanted to do something from Shakespeare. So he transferred it to me.
For me, To the Lighthouse was love at first sight or rather at first reading. To translate a book, I first read it from the beginning to the end. Then I started writing each sentence by hand. When I finished the whole book I read my translation from the beginning to the end, checking it with the original, and making corrections. Then I typed it, and read the typed copy, making changes again. All in all that added up to five readings. I started translating the novel in 1943 and submitted it to the Bureau in 1944. It was published in 1945 under the general title of ""New English Literature"" in the series called ""Translations from World Literature"" known as the ""Classical Series"".
So, the first book by Virginia Woolf in Turkish appeared in 1945, and it was To the Lighthouse. This was eighteen years after its publication in England in 1927. To me the book itself was pure poetry; I read it as if in a dream. Not trying to dive very deeply into it, I sort of swam on it or over it. Now, years later, _ . Even after so many years, in each reading I become conscious of new layers of which I haven't been aware before. It keeps pace with my experiences in life as years go by, and each reading is a new reading for me.
In 1982 and again in 1989 I revised it for two new editions and I again did it sentence by sentence checking it with the original. In those years I had thought it was necessary to revise my translations every ten years, but now I think I must do it every three or four years. In a country like Turkey, where we work very hard to clear our language from old and new foreign words, we should try to be up to date as to the words we are using, and of the same importance are the studies being made on the methods or techniques of translation, and new approaches in translation.
While translating, I usually have both the writer and the reader in mind. The novels she wrote after 1920 were especially new for most of the readers. She usually uses very short sentences, followed by rather long ones. I remember sentences of more than ten lines which weren't easy for me to translate as they were. And in Turkish our having only one word, the word ""O"", for ""he"", ""she"", ""it"" in English, made me repeat the names of the characters more often than Woolf did. And I changed some long indirect sentences in the original into direct sentences in my translation, thinking it would make an easier reading in Turkish.
When translating, I make use of all kinds of dictionaries. A difficult English word for me is the word ""vision"". In To the Lighthouse, the artist Lily Briscoe is trying to finish the picture she has been drawing for some time and the novel ends with the following sentences: ""Yes, she thought, laying down her brush extremely tired, I've had my vision."" And I'm still thinking about how to translate this remark into Turkish. 
 Question:While translating, the writer repeated the names of the characters to  _  . 
A. make full use of the direct sentences 
B. emphasize all of these characters 
C. make her translation clearer in Turkish 
D. make her translation much briefer

Context: In 1992, I had just launched a new business called Video News International.
It was the world's first video journalist network. The idea was to cover news and sell the service to news organizations.
One day, a young intern   who was working for us named Anthony Lappe pulled me aside.
""There is something you have to see,"" he told me. ""Comcast is doing this really cool thing.""
""What?""
""The Internet,"" he said. ""It's going to be really big.""
Anthony later introduced me to the head of the Internet project.

Well, I was always looking for new clients.
""What are you going to pay?"" I asked.
He said that they could not pay anything for the content, but they would set up a URL for me.
""What's that?"" I asked.
""It's kind of like your address on the web.""
""What would I do with this URL thing?""
""Well, it could be your business.""
""I don't see how it is a business, and there's not even any advertising,"" I cleverly replied.
""Not yet,"" he said. ""But one day there might be.""
I thought about it for two seconds.
""Naah..."" I said. "" _ . I've got to be going now. Maybe we can cooperate next time.""
And I walked out.
Idiot!

Context: Tobacco companies are fighting efforts in the United States and Australia to make their products less appealing. In Washington, a federal judge last week blocked the Food and Drug Administration from requiring new warning labels on cigarette packs. Judge Richard Leon ruled in a case brought by five tobacco companies. The judge temporarily stopped a new federal rule which requires large new warnings starting next September. These include color1 images such as a dead body or diseased lungs. And simple text warnings now appear.
Congress called for color1 images showing the dangers of smoking, similar to what Canada does. But the tobacco companies say the new requirements approved in June violate   their free speech rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Judge Leon said the FDA could not require the new labels before a lawsuit  against the government is decided. Some experts say the process could take years. The judge said he believed the cigarette makers were highly likely to win their case.
He said the images should be designed to appeal to emotions, rejecting government arguments that they should be purely factual. He accused the government of trying to use the labels to promote an ""obvious anti-smoking agenda?""
The head of an anti-smoking group, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the decision ""wrong on the science and wrong on the law"".
About one-fifth of American adults smoke. The World Health Organization says tobacco kills nearly six mil-lion people worldwide each year. More than six hundred thousand of them are non-smokers who breathe other people's tobacco smoke.
In Australia, tobacco companies want to stop what would be the world's most restrictive laws on cigarette advertising. Cigarettes could be sold only in plain olive-green packages. Only the brand name and health warnings could appear. The Senate passed the bill last week and sent it back to the Lower House to approve minor amendments  . The law is to go into effect in December of next year.
Tobacco companies Say the legislation   violates the Australian constitution. They say it would unjustly reduce the value of their brand names and trademarks. Health Minister Nicola Roxon says the government is ready for a legal fight. 
 Question:What are the tobacco companies ii1 the United States and Australia fighting against? 
A. The requirements to sell fewer products to the public. 
B. The requirements to print new warning labels on their products. 
C. The measures to make their products more attractive. 
D. The ways to make the companies close their business.

Context: ""We don't necessarily believe that new advertising, which might make consumers feel better about the Coke brand or better about the ads themselves , will actually result in consumers consuming more of the product,"" Morgan Stanley's Bill Pecoriello wrote in a research note the days after the investor   meeting . But Coke is optimistic it can regain its old magic, and is banking on a new slogan: ""Welcome to the Coke side of life.""
BREAK THROUGH HIT? 
With PepsiCo about to surpass  Coke as the beverage king on Wall Street--Pepsi's market capitalization has  _ in recent years to $97.9 billion, putting it less than a billion dollars behind its rival--the heat is on Coke . It's set to launch a new marketing campaign in March, 2006. And having taken a quick look at Coke's investor presentation on Dec. 7 in New York, my sense is that Coke may be moving in the right direction .
Given the continued shift by consumers away from soda--Coke's stronghold --and into alternative beverages like juice, tea, and water, Coke badly needs a breakthrough hit. And given that shift away from soda, some analyists wonder whether even the catchiest new ads will be enough to put the fizz back into Coke.
SAME OLD, UPDATED?
    The new flavors of PowerAde sports drink will probably enable Coke to continue stealing market share from PepsiCo's Gatorade brand. And Coke is getting a little more creative with packaging, including new, aluminum bottles of Coke that will be sold in nightclubs, and an 8.4-ounce ""100 calorie"" version of its flagship Coke that will appeal to women who want fewer calories and will like the fact that the small can will fit in their purse. I doubt whether other new products will be successful, including a new coffee-flavored soda called Coke-Cola Black that I tried. Think carbonated coffee. But I'm not sure if the product, which Coke is pitching as an afternoon pick-me-up for the 35-and-over set, is going to pull people away from their afternoon Frappucino fix. And my opinion is that Vault, an orange-flavored energy drink, will have just as much trouble unseating Mountain Dew among teens as did Coke's last attempt, a product called Surge.
If there is one concern I have about the fresh offerings Coke plans to launch this year, it appears that many of them are simply new brands, not new products. 
 Question:According to the passage, we can know that   _  . 
A. Coke mainly depends on new products recently 
B. Nowadays Coke is comparatively less popular 
C. PepsiCo has taken the place of Coke 
D. Coke has few new brands 
 Answer: B
Context: In 1991, Kentucky Fried Chicken announced that it was officially changing its name to ""KFC"" as well as updating its packaging and logo with a more modern look. The public relations reason was that health-conscious consumers associated the word ""fried"" with ""unhealthy"", causing some of them to completely avoid the wide variety of ""healthy"" menu items. The new title and image were designed to attract customers to a restaurant now offering foods branded as ""better for you"".
It sounded good, but the real reason behind the shift to KFC had nothing to do with critical consumers. In 1990, the Commonwealth of Kentucky, trapped in debt, took the unusual step of trade marking its name. Therefore, anyone using the word ""Kentucky"" for business reasons would have to obtain permission and pay licensing fees to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. It was an unusual and brilliant scheme to lighten government debt, but it was also one that alienated  one of the most famous companies ever associated with Kentucky. The Kentucky Fried Chicken chain refused as a matter of principle to pay royalties on a name they had been using for four decades. After a year of fruitless talks, Kentucky Fried Chicken changed their name instead, introducing new packaging and products to hide the real reasons behind the change of the name.
Kentucky fried Chicken was not the only one who bravely refused to give in. The name of the most famous horse race in North America, held every year at Churchill Downs, was changed to ""The Run for the Roses"" for similar reasons.
In November 2006, KFC and the State of Kentucky finally reached a settlement over the use of the trademarked word ""Kentucky"", and the restaurant chain announced it would be reusing its former name of ""Kentucky Fried Chicken"". 
 Question:The public relations reason for Kentucky Fried Chicken's updating its packaging and logo was that  _  . 
A. it was losing money 
B. most customers didn't like the old logo 
C. it wanted to get involved in other businesses 
D. it decided to offer better foods to customers

Context: It can greet people, show DVDs and hand out balloons. ""Ubiko"", a robot-on -wheels with a catlike face, is joining the crew of temporary workers supplied by a Japanese job-referral company, Ubiquitous Exchange, to stores, events and even weddings. Next month, the 44-inch tall robot will be selling mobile phones at a store.
Ubiko can be hired as a temporary worker for two hours for 105,000 yen, or $890.
""We see this as serious business. There are jobs that robots are better at,"" Akiko Sakurai said ""people do develop a relation with the robot, and it's lovable.""
The $255,000 robot, which is equipped with a camera and sensors, greets customers with a nasal electronic voice, shows DVDs with a projector in its head and hands out balloons and other goods with wireless remote-controllable arms.
Ubiko sounds like a Japanese female name, which often ends with ""ko"".
Tmsuk, the Japanese company that makes the robot, sold three last month to hospital, where they are working as full-time, rather than temporary, receptionists and guides. One of the hospital's robots serves as a receptionist and has been programmed to greet visitors. It also has a touch-panel  on its body, and visitors can use it to get directions for where they want to go.
""Just give it electricity, and a robot can work for long hours, even do repetitive work, and you don't have to worry about labor laws,"" Sudo said.
Japan's lower birth rate means that in the coming years it could face a labor shortage, and some experts believe robots could be part of the key to that problem. Robots are very popular in Japan partly because of the popularity of cartoons that describe robots as friends and assistants to humans. 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that   _  . 
A. the price of Ubiko is $890 
B. the purpose for a store to buy the robot is to greet customers 
C. Ubiko can work for long hours without using energy 
D. three robots have been sold to a hospital 
 Answer: D
Context: When you're an employee of a company, no matter the size, it's common to see co-workers promoted, or transferred to a different department. But there is another way to move around--by creating a new position for yourself. I did this several years ago, though I wasn't actively looking for a different job.
In 2007, I was hired at the Transamerica Life Insurance Company, as a customer service representative in the distributions services department. I processed requests for distributions from our annuity policy holders around the country. Someone might have forgotten to sign a form, for example, or might have omitted security information. To solve the problem, I'd mail the person a letter.
The company had been through several combinations, so in our department alone we had a collection of about 140 templates  for letters related to distributions. The longer I worked with the letters, the more I saw how they could be improved. Some had overlapping information and could be combined. Some had incorrect grammar or needed updating. I also noticed that industry terminology  wasn't standard across all the versions.
When I told my department supervisor about this in 2008, she agreed that the letters needed _ . She said I should stop what I'd been doing and start the new work. In a relatively short time, I was able to make numerous improvements and reduce the number of letters to 70. It was an informal job change until a managers' meeting several months later.
At that meeting, a vice president who was unaware of my new work mentioned that the division's entire stock of 1,700 letters should be reviewed. My manager told her that she knew the perfect person for the job--me. The position was still considered temporary when I took on the extra tasks, but I was able to show that the work had value, and I was officially promoted and given a raise in November 2009. 
 Question:Which of the following problems with the letters is NOT mentioned in the passage? 
A. Some information was overlooked. 
B. Some information needed to be united. 
C. Some had grammatical mistakes. 
D. Industry terminology didn't meet the standard.

Context: For many people around the world, a subway journey means speeding from one dull station to the next,surrounded by too many uncomfortable, impatient people. But on the Moscow Metro, taking the subway is like walking through a national heritage site. Depending on where you get off,you'll receive a brief course in architectural movements and face colorful glass windows, marble columns, gilded  mosaics and painted scenes from Russian history.
""These extraordinarily beautiful places are unlike any metro station I've ever seen,"" says Vancouver-based photographer David Burdeny.
When Burdeny, who himself has a master's degree in architecture, first found out about Moscow's metro stations, he was struck by the work of art. In all, he has photographed 20 of the most beautiful stations.
Burdeny had originally planned to focus on Russian stations more generally, taking photos of examples in both St. Petersburg and Moscow.
""But when I saw the stations in Moscow, they just completely blew away the St. Petersburg ones,""he says.
Shooting in the subway sounds simple, but it is not without challenges. For one thing, Burdeny had to figure out a way to access them between 12:30 a.m. and 5:30 a.m., when the stations were closed.
In the end, he settled on Arbatskaya Metro Station, whose vaulted   arches he found the most beautiful. But it also represented a challenge he was not sure he was able to overcome: conveying the hugeness of the spaces. The Arbatskaya platform, for example, stretches 820 feet.""Some of the arches are quite long,"" he says. ""When you enter them, they' re just so completely grand."" 
 Question:We can learn from the text that David Burdeny  _  . 
A. is a world-famous architect 
B. is studying Russian history 
C. took the subway to and from work 
D. took photos of Moscow subway stations

Context: Is it time to kick Russia out of the BRICs  ? If so, it may end up sounding like a famous ball-point pen maker-BIC. An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device ,the BRICs, should really be the BICs.
""Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?"" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreigh Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of ""The Russian Balance Sheet"", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes:
""The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas. ""
Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing
far better than Russia.
But the BRICs are not just about economy. As is mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while around 80 percent is for the other three.
At very least, however, Russia's economic underperformance and stock market outperfoumance does suggest it is indeed one of the group. 
 Question:From the passage we know that   _  . 
A. Anders Aslund is working for the Russian government 
B. Russia outperfoumed the other three countries in stock market 
C. most people disagree Russia is included in BRICs 
D. the BRICs would end up being the BICs sooner or later

Context: ""When an American asks me this question, it's like a wall of ice crashing down between us."" my Moscow-born friend Galina said. The question is ""How are you?"".
The answer Americans give, of course is, ""Fine."" But when Russians hear this they think one of two things: you are experiencing a rare moment of fineness or you are lying.
Ask a Russian, ""How are you?"" and you will hear, for better or worse, the truth. I have experienced many painful minutes of silence after my grandmother made her stock response: ""Terrible,"" to which she might add, ""Why? Because being old is terrible and I am very old.""
""'Fine' makes Russians think that Americans have no soul,"" I explained recently to an American-born friend. ""That they just want to go home, eat a frozen dinner in front of the TV, and wait out the hours before going to work to make money again."" He laughed, ""You know, there's something to that.""
The thing most Russians don't realize is that, in English, ""How are you?"" isn't a question at all, but a form of ""hi"", like the Russian ""privyet!""
Psychologists at the University of Michigan have shown that, while Russians are, indeed, easier to be depressed than Americans, their open acceptance of bad experiences might be healthier.
Recently, when I looked through a few American guides on traveling to Russia, I was disappointed to find that they all suggested that tourists adopt the American approach to ""How are you"".

A. answer ""fine"" 
B. tell you the truth

Context: In 2007.five young people in the American state of Massachusetts developed an idea. The team knew that the world is filled with mobile phones.About eighty percent of all people are said to live within reach of a wireless telephone signal.    
    The idea was to use mobile phones and the Internet to connect job seekers with employers.The young people wrote a business plan and formed a company called Assured Labor.
    Assured Labor won a development competition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Three of the founders were graduate students there.    '
    Assured Labo is an electronic market place.It has two parts.One is for;the United States.That operation was launched in January in Boston.It links people with employees offering temporary jobs.
    The other arm of the business is for developing markets.That operation is meant to help people get mbfe permanent jobs.A representative is currently building partnerships with universities,and international companies in Central America.
    Assured Labor's president David Reich,says the companies now place job advertisements on radio or in newspapers.Some even drive around in cars with loudspeakers announcing that jobs are available.He says the companies are interested.in having more modem hiring practices.
    Through Assured Labor, companies will list open positions on the Internet.People who think
 they could do the job could reply by text messages or on their cellophanes.
    This is how the system works inprefix = st1 /Boston.
The jobs available include house cleaning.Dog walking and home repay. People who want their house cleaned,for example,can look online at a list of twenty housekeepers.The list tells what services.they offer,and how much they want to be paid.People need two letters praising their work to get on the list of service providers.
    The employer chooses workers they would like jot hire ,The company then sends the workers a text or e-mail message so they can respond quickly to an offer.
    After a job is completed,the employer and employee rate each other, The rating is kept for  future use.Assured Labor is not charging anyone,right now, but the plan is to have employers pay for the service. 
 Question:what kinds of jobs does Assured Labor offer? 
A. Temporary jobs. 
B. Permanent jobs. 
C. Free jobs 
D. Both A and B* 
 Answer: D
Context: At one time, computers were expected largely to remove the need for paper copies of documents  because they could be stored electronically. But for all the texts that are written, stored and sent electronically, a lot of them are still ending up on paper.
It is difficult to measure the quantity of paper used as a result of use of Internet-connected computers, although just about anyone who works in an office can tell you that when e-mail is introduced, the printers start working overtime. ""I feel in my bones this revolution is causing more trees to be cut down,"" says Ted Smith of the Earth Village Organization.
Perhaps the best sign of how computer and Internet use pushes up demand for paper comes from the high-tech industry itself, which sees printing as one of its most promising new markets. Several Internet companies have been set up to help small businesses print quality documents from a computer. Earlier this week Hewlett-Packard Co. announced a plan to develop new technologies that will enable people to print even more so they can get a hard copy of a business document, a medical record or just a on-line e-mail, even if they are nowhere near a computer. As the company sees it, the more use of the Internet the greater demand for printers.
Does all this mean environmental concerns   have been forgotten? Some activists suggest people have been led to believe that a lot of dangers to the environment have gone away.
""I guess people believe that the problem is taken care of, because of recycling ,"" said Kelly Quirke, director of the Rainforest Action Network in San Francisco. Yet Quirke is hopeful that high-tech may also prove helpful. He says printers that print on both sides are growing in popularity.
The action group has also found acceptable paper made from materials other than wood, such as agricultural waste. 
 Question:Hewlett-Packard Co. has decided to develop new technologies because   _  . 
A. people are concerned about the environment 
B. printers in many offices are working overtime 
C. small companies need more hard copies 
D. they see a growing market for printers

Context: Cyberspace, data superhighway, multimedia, for those who have seen the future, and the linking of computers, televisions and telephones will change our lives for ever. Yet for all the talks of a forthcoming technological utopia, little attention has been given to the implications of these developments for the poor. As for all the new high technology, the West concerns itself with the ""how"", while the question of ""for whom"" is put aside once again.
Economists are only now realizing the full extent to which the communication revolution has affected the world economy. Information technology allows the extension of trade across geographical and industrial boundaries, and transnational corporations take full advantage of it. Terms of trade and exchange, interest rates and money movements are more important than the production of goods. The electronic economy made by information technology allows the haves to increase their control on global markets -- with a destructive impact on the havenots.
For them the result is unstable. Developing countries which rely on the production of a small range of goods for export are made to feel like small parts in the international economic machine. As ""futures"" are traded on computer screens, developing countries simply have less and less control of their destinies.
So what are the options of regaining control?One alternative for developing countries is to buy in the latest computers and telecommunications. Yet this leads to long-term dependency and perhaps permanent constraints ( ,) on developing countries' economies.
Communication technology is generally exported from the US, Europe or Japan;the patents, skills and ability remain in the hands of a few industrialized countries. It is also expensive, therefore imported products and services must be bought on credit usually provided by the very countries whose companies stand to gain. 
 Question:It can be inferred from the passage that   _   . 
A. international trade should be expanded 
B. the interests of the poor countries have not been given enough consideration 
C. the exports of the poor countries should be increased 
D. communication technology in developing countries should be modernized

Context: Copenhagen is a city full of fairy tales . If you want to _ it, you have to spend a long time and walk slower to enjoy yourself. Copenhagen was the first city to have a street for walkers only. The city has less traffic noise and pollution than any other European capital.
Walking along the river banks, you'll see the Amalienborg Palace first. The king's family is living there.
Churches and castles show us the original city. Copenhagen became the capital of Denmark in 1445. But fires in 1728 and 1795 completely destroyed  the old wooden buildings. Much of what we see today dates back to  the 19th and early 20th centuries.
Keep going, and you'll see the Christiansborg Palace. The town of Copenhagen began there. The you'll see Nyhavn ,a waterway, which was dug in 1673. When you see it, you'll understand why Hans Christian Andersen made this beautiful waterway his home. Nyhavn is a peaceful and wonderful place. You'll usually see some rich people walk along here.
If you walk there, you can enjoy the old trees, the colorful lights and the beautiful gardens. You might feel as if you were in a fairy tale. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE about Nyhavn? 
A. Andersen made it his home. 
B. It has a history of 383 years. 
C. Rich people seldom walk along it 
D. It's a fictitious place in a fairy tale. 
 Answer: A
Context: While other countries debate whether to fix wind turbines  offshore or in distant areas, Denmark is building them right in its capital. Three windmills  were recently introduced in a Copenhagen neighbourhood, and the city plans to add another 97.
""We've made a very ambitious commitment to make Copenhagen CO2-neutral by 2025,"" Frank Jensen, the mayor, says. ""But going green isn't only a good thing. It's a must."" The city's carbon-neutral plan, passed two years ago, will make Copenhagen the world's first zero-carbon capital.
With wind power making up 33% of Denmark's energy supply, the country already features plenty of wind turbines. Indeed, among the first sights greeting airborne visitors during the landing at Copenhagen's Kastrup airport is a chain of sea-based wind towers. By 2020, the windswept country plans to get 50% of its energy from wind power.
Now turbines are moving into the city and these ones will cost less than half the price of those sea-based. Having the energy production closer makes it cheaper, and land-based turbines are the cheapest possible source of energy available today. Fixing them also makes the locals more aware of their energy consumption.
Though considerably less attractive than it was in ancient times, the windmill is enjoying popularity in the 21st century. ""Windmills are a symbol of the new and clean Copenhagen,"" says resident Susanne Sayers. Meanwhile, fellow Copenhagen citizen Maria Andersen worries about the noise, explaining that she wouldn't want a wind turbine in her neighbourhood. While Copenhagen citizens approve of the windmills, they're less willing to live close to one. The answer, the city has decided, is to sell turbine shares.
Each share represents 1,000 kW hours/year, with the profit tax-free. With a typical Copenhagen household consuming 3,500 kW hours/year, a family buying four shares effectively owns its own renewable energy supply. To date, 500 residents have bought 2,500 shares. Involving the local population was a smart move. ""There are a lot of things you can do close to people if it's not too big and if there's a model where locals feel involved and get to share in the profit. Knowing that you, or your neighbours, own a technology creates a very different atmosphere than if a multinational owned it,"" says Vad Mathiesen.
Going green? Yes. Accepted by the population? Yes. Going with centuries-old city architecture? Hardly.
Certainly, the three turbines don't exactly _ the 18th-century city centre, as they are in a neighbourhood 3 km away. According to the mayor's office, none of the remaining 97 turbines will rise in architecturally sensitive areas. But Sascha Haselmayer, CEO of city creation group Citymart, warns, ""With Denmark being a world-leading producer of windmills, there is a risk that the answer to every energy question is windmills.""
""We've destroyed mountains and lakes in order to support our lifestyle,"" notes Irena Bauman, an architect and professor at Sheffield University. ""Wind turbines are a sign that we're learning to live with nature. I hope we'll have them all over the world,"" she says. ""They may be unpleasant to some, but better-looking ones will come. It's just that we don't have time to wait for them!"" 
 Question:How has the city of Copenhagen persuaded its people to accept the windmills around their homes? 
A. By promising them that all their income is free of tax. 
B. By designing less noisy windmills to ease their worries. 
C. By convincing them that land-based turbines are much cheaper. 
D. By offering them the chance to get the profit the windmills bring. 
 Answer: D
Context: When Denis Hennequin took over as the European boss of McDonald's in January 2004, the world's biggest restaurant chain was showing signs of recovery in America and Australia, but sales in Europe were sluggish or declining.One exception was France, where Mr.Hennequin had done a reliable job as head on the group's French subsidiary  to sell more Big Macs to his relatives, His task was to copy this success in all 41 of the European countries where anti-globalisers' favourite enemy operates.

Mr.Hennequin's recipe for revival  is to be more open about his company's operations, to be ""locally relevant"", and to improve the experience of visiting his 6.400 restaurants. McDonaId's is blamed for making people fat, exploiting workers, treating animals cruelly, polluting the environment and simply for being American.Mr.Hennequin says he wants to engage in a dialogue with the public to address these concerns.
He introduced ""open door"" visitor days in each country which became hugely popular.In Poland alone some 50,000 visitors came to McDonaId's through the visitors' program last year.The Nutrition Information Initiative launched last year, put detailed Sables on McDonaId's packaging with data on calories, protein, fat, carbohy drates and salt content, ""the details are also printed on tray-liners.

A. He visited all the McDonaId's branches in Europe. 
B. He introduced ""open door"" visitor's days in each country. 
C. He had done a reliable job as head of the group's French subsidiary.

Context: There is no doubt that Apple is well aware of the increased competition in the market and could be in a hurry to put another device out there, said Ramon Llamas, senior research analyst at IDC Mobile Devices Technology and Trends. Given its history with product launches and business policy, though, Apple probably isn't going to rush an iPhone release simply to put it on shelves, he said.
""If you're Tim Cook (CEO of Apple), you're thinking if you want to pay more attention to how to keep growing that bottom line and keep investors happy, or continue with the same approach from Apple, which is do what we can do and manage products and releases in the best way they can work for us. Apple usually does things in their own time ,and I'm having a hard time buying this May or June timeline."" Llamas told Mac News World.
While it,s probable that Apple is definitely in a testing stage for its next smartphone , consumers likely have a standard wait for the finished product, said Colin Gibbs, analyst at GigaOm Pro.
""It typically takes a year or longer to create a state-of-the-art smartphone, so no one should be surprised Apple is in the testing stages with the next iPhone. And while it's possible that Apple could launch the next iPhone this spring or summer, I'm not expecting to see it until a little later in the year,"" he told Mac News World.
When it does launch, though, it could be in a variety of colors, said Gibbs. ""Apple has already tested the waters with releasing colored devices when it revamped(,)its iPod line last fall, so it's not too much of a stretch to believe it would want the new twist with its smartphone, as well"".
""I wouldn't be surprised if the new iPhone becomes available in some new colors,'' he said. ""That could be done pretty cheaply ,and it would give Apple a new marketing angle."" 
 Question:What's Colin Gibbs ,attitude towards the next iPhone? 
A. Disapproving. 
B. Casual 
C. Objective. 
D. Doubtful.

Context: As Apple tries to maintain its growth and success in China, the world's largest smart-phone market is becoming even more critical. Apple's shares  fell sharply as the company's earnings for the holiday quarter through December disappointed investors.
The sales of the iPhone, which include both the iPhone 5 and older models, came in at the low end of analysts' expectations, while the company's income plan for the second quarter was below analysts' forecasts, though Apple is known to give conservative   forecasts.
Som'6 analysts have said that for Apple to regain its growth, the company.needs a more aggressive strategy for markets, or more specifically for China, where the market for smart phones has been expanding more rapidly than anywhere else. In China, demand is particularly great for inexpensive phones that run on Android  operating system, sold by many Chinese phone makers as well as South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.
But Apple says it's already enjoying strong growth in China. ""We saw big growth in iPhones,""Chief Executive Tim Cook said. He said that the company has been quickly expanding its sales channels in China, including the number of Apple stores. ""This isn't nearly what we need, we're not even close to that, but we're making great progress. "" he said.
In China, a big missing piece for Apple is China Mobile Ltd. , the biggest local telecom carrier that doesn't yet sell the iPhone. Earlier this month, Mr. Cook met China Mobile Chairman Xi Guohua in Beijing and discussed cooperation, stirring hopes that the world's largest mobile carrier may soon start offering the iPhone.
Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is working on a lower-end iPhone that could launch as early as this year. But one possible challenge for Apple in China is that low-pricod Android-based phones are getting better in terms of quality. A report from CLSA in late November showed that many smart-phones sold at about 1,000 yuan ( $160) came with higher-reso-lution screens, better cameras and more powerful processors than phones at that price did a year earlier. 
 Question:What can we learn from the passage? 
A. Apple tends to offer a lower sales forecast. 
B. China Mobile Ltd began to team up with Apple. 
C. Cook is pessimistic about what Apple did in China. 
D. Apple didn't take measures to develop Chinese market.

Context: Sirs,
 Your twelve thousand 'Smart' watches were received by our company this morning. However, we wish to make a number of complaints concerning the serious delay in delivery and your failure to carry out our instructions regard to this order.
It was firmly pointed out from the beginning that the delivery date had to be less than six weeks from the original order in order to satisfy our own customers' requirements. While we understand that delays in production are occasionally unavoidable, we must point out that the major reason why the order was placed with your company was that we were assured by you of its simplicity, and that your existing stocks were sufficiently high to ensure immediate shipment. Late delivery of the goods has caused us to disappoint several of our most valued customers, and will have an unfavorable effect on future orders.
The second complaint concerns the difference in colour between the watches we ordered and those delivered. It was stated clearly in the order that watches in combinations of green/purple and orange/purple only were required. However, only half the watches in the delivery received are of the colours specified. Our Hong Kong agent informed you of the importance of following our instructions exactly, since we consider there to be only a limited market in this country for watches of other color1s at the present time. Any watches that are not of the specified colours will, of course, be returned to you.
We are also somewhat concerned about the rather poor quality of the goods received, since it is obvious that the watches that finally arrived have been made from not good enough materials and have been produced to a lower standard than those in the sample. We have also found that a number of the watches do not appear to be working. Whether the latter problem is due to poor production, or damage in transportation is not yet clear, but we should like to point out that we feel this matter to be entirely your fault.
As a result of the above problems, therefore, we feel that the most suitable course of action is to return to you unpaid any of the goods considered unsatisfactory. We shall also, of course, be forced to reconsider whether any further orders should be placed with your company.
We look forward to your early reply.

Context: New rules will let millions of Americans know where more of their food comes from. The law is known as COOL -- Country of Origin Labeling .
American congress first passed the law in 2002. Stores have had to label seafood by country of origin since 2005. But industry pressure delayed other requirements until last week.
Products that must now be labeled include fresh fruits and vegetables, muscle meats and some kinds of nuts. But the rules are complex, and many foods are not included. For example, organ meats are free to be labeled. So are processed foods, including cooked or smoked foods.
The same food may sometimes have to be labeled and other times not. Fresh or frozen peas, for example, have to be labeled but not canned peas. Foods that are mixed with other foods are also excluded. Mixed nuts, for example, do not need to be labeled. The same is true of a salad mix that contains different things like lettuce and carrots. Or a fruit cup that combines different fruits. Also, the law doesn't include restaurants and other food service organizations. Department of Agriculture officials say the law is really meant for larger grocery stores.
The United States has imported more and more food in recent years to save money and expand choices. Country-of-origin labeling has become more common lately but has still been limited in many stores.
Food safety is one reason why some shoppers pay close attention to where foods came from. For example, when a large number of people recently got sick from salmonella , officials blamed peppers from Mexico. Yet the last big food scare involved spinach grown in California. But labeling is also a way for people to know they are getting what they want. Some want to buy local foods or foods from a particular country.
The country-of-origin labeling law gives stores 30 days to correct any violations  that are found. Stores and suppliers that are found to be deliberately violating the law could be fined 1,000 dollars per violation. Federal inspectors are not to take action to enforce the law for six months to give time for an education campaign.
Some food safety activists say they are generally pleased with the law. They call it a good step that will give people more useful information. 
 Question:The new rules of the country-of-origin labeling law will come into effect  _  . 
A. right now 
B. in a month 
C. in three months 
D. in half a year 
 Answer: D
Context: Food prices have risen sharply over the past few years. The good news is that the rate of increase has slowed. The bad news is that prices will not go down anytime soon.
Also,the rate of global agricultural production is slowing. Yet it needs to increase 60% over the next 40 years to feed a growing world population.
These are among the findings from the OECDFAO(the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development & the Food and Agriculture Organization)Agricultural Outlook 2012-2021.
FAO DirectorGeneral Jose Graziano da Silva spoke at a news conference in Rome when the report was released. Mr.Da Silva said that,not surprisingly,the world's poorest people will feel the greatest effects of higher prices.
""For the millions and millions of extremely poor people, the effects of high food prices are clear--they might have to change their diets,usually to ones with poorer nutrition quality, ""he said.
In middleincome countries, people are gaining weight as they eat fewer fruits and vegetables and more of the cheaper but less nutritious foods.
The report also shows that farmers in poorer countries will be leading efforts to feed an expected 9,000,000,000 people by 2050.The outlook predicts that farmers in Latin America,the Caribbean and subSaharan Africa will drive agricultural production in the future.
Angel Gurria,SecretaryGeneral of the OECD,said:""We can feed 9,000,000,000 people by 2050 on this planet. But we have to organize ourselves better."" But there are plenty of challenges.Onefourth of all agricultural land is damaged. Many countries face water shortages .And experts believe climate change is driving increasingly unusual weather patterns.
The report says farmers need to use more growing methods that can't cause damage to the environment.At the same time,it says governments should end economically harmful supports and spend more money to increase agricultural production.Mr.Gurria says rich and poor nations need to treat agriculture more like a business.
""In many cases,agriculture is related in people's minds to the poorest. It's related to aid. It's related to very poor living conditions,etc. We have got to shake that image away,""he said. 
 Question:What can be done to deal with the slow agricultural production? 
A. Improving the growing methods. 
B. Finding more agricultural land. 
C. Preventing governments' involvement. 
D. Improving farmers' living conditions. 
 Answer: A
Context: Food labels are such a mess that the government is redesigning them, as the ingredient  lists are usually too confusing. As a result, a shopper could spend hours in a grocery store watching, calculating, and comparing, and still could not get it right. ShopWell is trying to help by allowing consumers to scan food labels and receive understandable and personalized information.
Here's how it works. Register for ShopWell, and enter your age and gender. Add your goals (General health? Or are you trying to lose weight?). Then, note what you want in your diet, such as protein or iron, and what you want to avoid(added sugar, say). Add your allergies  and things you cannot accept, and start scanning.
Then ShopWell will come up with a clearly personal result: green for a food that is good for you; yellow for foods you can enjoy a little; and red for foods you should avoid.
The results are easily understandable and is clean because it's not mixed with ads. Instead, ShopWell makes money by selling data to supermarkets. Its database contains 350,000 products, the app has been downloaded 1.3 million times, and the company claims a scan every two seconds ""in stores such as Walmart, Whole Foods and 7-Eleven,"" in the words of marketing manager James Allgood.
One of the first items I scanned was So Delicious Coconut Milk Creamer, which I buy because I'm lactose  intolerant. It turns out it's only a little suitable for me -- because of its 1 gram per serving of added sugar. I'm not sure I'll give it up. But Ididask the app to watch for added sugar, and it's doing its job.
One _ to ShopWell is that the scanner often doesn't work for items from Costco or Trader Joe's. Meanwhile, Some user reviews say that it doesn't cover enough allergies. 
 Question:Why do consumers hesitate long when deciding which food to purchase in a shop? 
A. Because there are usually an extremely wide variety of food in the shop. 
B. Because food labels in the shop are in such a mess that they need redesigning. 
C. Because consumers desire to scan food labels for understandable information. 
D. Because consumers can hardly make sense of the information on the food labels. 
 Answer: D
Context: Ever since they were first put on the market in the early 1990s, genetically modified (GM, ) foods have been increasingly developed and marketed in many countries in the world, mainly on the basis of their promise to end the worldwide food crisis. But can GM technology solve world hunger problems? Even if it would, is it the best solution?
Despite what it promises, GM technology actually has not increased the production potential of any crop. In fact, studies show that the most widely grown GM crop, GM soybeans, has suffered reduced productivity. For instance, a report that analysed nearly two decades of research on major GM food crops shows that GM engineering has failed to significantly increase US crop production.
Something else, however, has been on the rise, While GM seeds are expensive, GM companies tell farmers that they will make good profits by saving money on pesticides . On the contrary, US government data show that GM crops in the US have produced an overall increase in pesticide use compared to traditional crops. ""The promise was that you could use less chemicals and _ production. But neither is true,"" said Bill Christison, President of the US National Farm Coalition.
At the same time, the authors of the book World Hunger: Twelve Myths argue that there actually is more than enough food in the world and that the hunger crisis is not caused by production, but by problems in food distribution and politics. These indeed deserve our efforts and money. Meanwhile, the rise in food prices results from the increased use of crops for fuel rather than food, according to a 2008 World Bank report.
As a matter of fact, scientists see better ways to feed the world. Another World Bank report concluded that GM crops have little to offer to the challenges of worldwide poverty and hunger, because better ways out are available, among which ""green"" farming is supposed to be the first choice. 
 Question:Which of the following best describes the attitude of the author towards GM technology? 
A. Optimistic 
B. Defensive 
C. Disapproving 
D. Casual

Context: John McCain and Barack Obama call for closer U.S.-Chinese cooperation on trade, the environment and nuclear proliferation  in the upcoming issue of an American business group's magazine. They do so in an unusual effort to  _ voters abroad.
Both articles appeared Sunday on the website of the American Chamber of Commerce  in China, and will be published in China Brief, the chamber's monthly magazine, on September 22.
Both stress that the countries should work more closely to ease trade friction , fight global warming, improve military exchanges, and block the spread of nuclear weapons to such countries as Iran and North Korea. 
""Cooperation on the key, enduring global challenges, such as climate change, can deepen understanding and enhance confidence. """"We also need to deepen high-level dialogues on a sustained basis on economic, security and global political issues"", said Obama in the article.
McCain agreed that the cooperation with prefix = st1 /Chinawould be essential in addressing issues of global concern. ""TheUnited Statesshares common interests withChinathat can form the basis of a strong partnership on issues of global concern, including climate change, trade and proliferation,"" he added. ""and I hope to see our relationship develop in a manner that benefits both countries and, in turn, the Asia-Pacific region and the world,"" he noted.
Both candidates  were impressed by China's economic success.
""Chinahas achieved extraordinary, sustained growth over the past three decades. Hundreds of millions of people inChinalive better now than most thought possible even two decades ago,"" Obama said.
""China's double-digit growth rates have brought hundreds of millions out of poverty, energized the economies of its neighbors and produced many new economic opportunities,"" McCain said.
Gao Wenhuan, 21st Century Online's special reporter, interviewed Marshall M. Bouton, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. ""My guess is, regardless of who is elected in November, you will hear basically the same description that Chinais a strategic partner and competitor,"" said Bouton.
A survey conducted by the Council in July 2008 found that the majority of respondents clearly admired China's accomplishments, but some Americans viewedChina's rising global power as a threat. According to the survey,Chinanow is seen as the most influential country in the world following theU.S..

Context: My mother once was a follower of traditional methods when it came to anything. She cooked traditional food, liked dressing up traditionally and thus was fond of traditional way of shopping.

She never bought things online but when they were delivered as a gift, she jumped for joy.

   After this incident she ordered a gift for her friend's wedding anniversary. She chose a gift basket that could be made to her requirements. They sent a beautifully decorated basket with fine wines and chocolates. The basket was so carefully decorated that it immediately became her friend's favorite gift.

Context: Several days ago, a Beijing - based IT company fired about 400 people overnight. No one had expected the job cuts, which broke with traditional ways of letting go of workers in China. Moreover, what was special about this case was that the day before the 400 were fired, they all received from their boss a gift - the book ""Who Moved My Cheese?"".
The book - a bestseller in the US - is being used by men and women to deal with changes in their lives and work. Some large organizations, including Coca- Cola, Kodak and General Motors, ask their employees to read it in order to encourage them to be active towards changes.
Cheese is something related to everyone's livelihood - our jobs, the industries we work in, relationships and love as well.

""Whatever challenges and changes we meet, we should face up to them bravely"" Jiang Hengwei, a civil servant said after reading the book.
Professor Yang in Renmin University of China agrees. ""We should change our way of thinking. The coming competitive foreign companies and products provide us with great chances to learn from them and improve our own products to meet international standards and be more competitive.""

Context: Sparrow is a fast-food chain with 200 restaurants. Some years ago, the group to which Sparrow belonged was taken over by another company. Although Sparrow showed no sign of declining, the chain was generally in an unhealthy state. With more and more fast-food concepts reaching the market, the Sparrow menu had to struggle for attention. And to make matters worse, its new owner had no plans to give it the funds it required.
Sparrow failed to grow for another two years. Until a new CEO, Carl Pearson, decided to build up its market share. He did a survey, which showed that consumers who already used Sparrow restaurants were extremely positive about the chain, while customers of other fast-food chains were unwilling to turn away from them. Sparrow had to develop a new promotional campaign.
Pearson faced a battle over the future of the Sparrow brand. The chain's owner now favored rebranding Sparrow as Marcy's restaurants. Pearson resisted, arguing for an advertising campaign designed to convince customers that visits to Sparrow restaurants were fun. Such an attempt to establish a positive relationship between a company and the general public was unusual for that time. Pearson strongly believed that numbers were the key to success, rather than customers' speeding power. Finally, the owner accepted his idea.
The campaign itself changed the traditional advertising style of the fast-food industry. The TV ads of Sparrow focused on entertainment and featured original songs performed by a variety of stars. Instead of showing the superiority of a specific product, the intention was to put Sparrow in the hearts of potential customers.
Pearson also made other decisions which he believed would contribute to the new Sparrow image. For example, he offered to lower the rent of any restaurants which achieved a certain increase in their turnover   .
These efforts paid off, and Sparrow soon became one of the most successful fast-food chains in the regions where it operated. 
 Question:What was Pearson's achievement as a CEO? 
A. He managed to pay off Sparrow's debts. 
B. He made Sparrow much more competitive 
C. He helped Sparrow take over a company 
D. He improved the welfare of Sparrow employees

Context: New rules will let millions of Americans know where more of their food comes from. The law is known as COOL -- Country of Origin Labeling .
American congress first passed the law in 2002. Stores have had to label seafood by country of origin since 2005. But industry pressure delayed other requirements until last week.
Products that must now be labeled include fresh fruits and vegetables, muscle meats and some kinds of nuts. But the rules are complex, and many foods are not included. For example, organ meats are free to be labeled. So are processed foods, including cooked or smoked foods.
The same food may sometimes have to be labeled and other times not. Fresh or frozen peas, for example, have to be labeled but not canned peas. Foods that are mixed with other foods are also excluded. Mixed nuts, for example, do not need to be labeled. The same is true of a salad mix that contains different things like lettuce and carrots. Or a fruit cup that combines different fruits. Also, the law doesn't include restaurants and other food service organizations. Department of Agriculture officials say the law is really meant for larger grocery stores.
The United States has imported more and more food in recent years to save money and expand choices. Country-of-origin labeling has become more common lately but has still been limited in many stores.
Food safety is one reason why some shoppers pay close attention to where foods came from. For example, when a large number of people recently got sick from salmonella , officials blamed peppers from Mexico. Yet the last big food scare involved spinach grown in California. But labeling is also a way for people to know they are getting what they want. Some want to buy local foods or foods from a particular country.
The country-of-origin labeling law gives stores 30 days to correct any violations  that are found. Stores and suppliers that are found to be deliberately violating the law could be fined 1,000 dollars per violation. Federal inspectors are not to take action to enforce the law for six months to give time for an education campaign.
Some food safety activists say they are generally pleased with the law. They call it a good step that will give people more useful information. 
 Question:The new rules of the country-of-origin labeling law will come into effect  _  . 
A. right now 
B. in a month 
C. in three months 
D. in half a year 
 Answer: D
Context: When you buy a T-shirt, or a fur coat in a store, it often carries a label telling who made it or from what store it was bought. Instead, some labels show the dress is famous and it is very expensive, so buyers secretly wish they could be carried forever. On the other hand, buyers who deal with the cheapest products would be pleased to be away with labels  _ .
However, there is another label more important than the one showing from which store the dress was bought. When a person buys a fur coat, or a jacket from a store, a label telling what the product is made of should be carried to it.
The label is required by law. Besides telling what the product on show is made of, the label should be in clear English and be where one can find it easily. The information on the label must be true.
The reason for this is that most buyers today aren't expert enough to know exactly what kind of fur or material they are buying. The buyers must believe in the store that sells the products or in what the label says. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE? 
A. A T-shirt seldom carries a label. 
B. A fur coat with a high price often carries a false label. 
C. A label only says what material the product is made of. 
D. Not all buyers know the materials they are buying.

Context: College graduation brings both the satisfaction of academic achievement and the expectation of a well-paid job. But for 6,000 graduates at prefix = st1 /San JoseStatethis year, there's uncertainty as they enter one of the worst job markets in decades. Ryan Stewart has a freshly-minted  degree in religious studies, but no job prospects.
""You look at everybody's parents and neighbors, and they're getting laid off and don't have jobs,"" said Stewart, ""then you look at the young people just coming into the workforce... it's just scary.""
When the class of 2003 entered college, the future never looked brighter. But in the four years they've been here, the world outside has changed greatly.
""Those were the exciting times, lots of  _ opportunities, exploding offers, students getting top dollar with lots of benefits,"" said Cheryl Allmen-Vinnidge of theSan JoseStateCareerCenter. ""Times have changed. It's a mew market.""
Cheryl Allmen-Vinnidge ought to know. She runs the San JoseStateCareerCenter, sort of a crossroad between college and the real world. Allmen-Vinnidge says students who do find jobs after college have done their homework.
""The typical graduate who does have a job offer started working on it two years ago. They've postured  themselves well during the summer. They've had several internships "", she said. And they've majored in one of the few fields that are still hot, like chemical engineering, accounting, or nursing, where average starting salaries  have actually increased over last year. Other popular fields have seen big declines in starting salaries.
Ryan Stewart may just end up going back to school. ""I'd like to teach college some day and that requires more schooling, which would be great in a bad economy,"" he said. 
To some students, a degree may not be a ticket to instant wealth. For now, they can only hope its value will increase overtime. 
 Question:Ryan Stewart is probably going to   _  . 
A. get a teaching job 
B. become a religious leader 
C. change his major 
D. go back to school

Context: One of the main challenges facing many countries is how to maintain their identity in the face of globalization and the growing multi-language trend. ""One of the main reasons for economic failure in many African countries is the fact that, with a few important exceptions, mother-tongue education is not practiced in any of the independent African states."" said Neville Alexander, Director of the Project for the Study of Alternative Education in South Africa at the University of Cape Town.
In response to the spread of English and the increased multi-language trends arising from immigration, many countries have introduced language laws in the laws in the last decade. In some, the use of languages other than the national language is banned in public spaces such as advertising posters. One of the first such legal provisions was the 1994 ""Toubon law"" in France, but the idea has been copied in many countries since then. Such efforts to govern language use are often dismissed as _ by language experts, who are well aware of the difficulty in controlling fashions in speech and know from research that language switching among bilinguals is a natural process.
It is especially difficult for native speakers of English to understand the desire to maintain the ""purity"" of a language by law. Since the time of Shakespeare, English has continually absorbed foreign words into its own language. English is one of the most mixed and rapidly changing languages in the world, but there has not been a barrier to acquiring prestige and power. Another reason for the failure of many native English speakers to understand the role of state regulation is that it has never been the Anglo-Saxon way of doing things. English has never had a state-controlled authority for the language, similar, for example, to the Academic Francaise in France.
The need to protect national languages is, for most western Europeans, a recent phenomenon--especially the need to ensure that English does not unnecessarily take over too many fields. Public communication, education and new modes of communication promoted by technology, may be key fields to defend. 
 Question:Why do many English-speaking countries not support the language protection efforts described in the passage? 
A. They think language protection laws are ineffective. 
B. They want their language to spread to other countries. 
C. They have a long history of taking words from other languages. 
D. It reduces a language's ability to acquire international importance. 
 Answer: C
Context: Food labels are such a mess that the government is redesigning them, as the ingredient  lists are usually too confusing. As a result, a shopper could spend hours in a grocery store watching, calculating, and comparing, and still could not get it right. ShopWell is trying to help by allowing consumers to scan food labels and receive understandable and personalized information.
Here's how it works. Register for ShopWell, and enter your age and gender. Add your goals (General health? Or are you trying to lose weight?). Then, note what you want in your diet, such as protein or iron, and what you want to avoid(added sugar, say). Add your allergies  and things you cannot accept, and start scanning.
Then ShopWell will come up with a clearly personal result: green for a food that is good for you; yellow for foods you can enjoy a little; and red for foods you should avoid.
The results are easily understandable and is clean because it's not mixed with ads. Instead, ShopWell makes money by selling data to supermarkets. Its database contains 350,000 products, the app has been downloaded 1.3 million times, and the company claims a scan every two seconds ""in stores such as Walmart, Whole Foods and 7-Eleven,"" in the words of marketing manager James Allgood.
One of the first items I scanned was So Delicious Coconut Milk Creamer, which I buy because I'm lactose  intolerant. It turns out it's only a little suitable for me -- because of its 1 gram per serving of added sugar. I'm not sure I'll give it up. But Ididask the app to watch for added sugar, and it's doing its job.
One _ to ShopWell is that the scanner often doesn't work for items from Costco or Trader Joe's. Meanwhile, Some user reviews say that it doesn't cover enough allergies. 
 Question:Why do consumers hesitate long when deciding which food to purchase in a shop? 
A. Because there are usually an extremely wide variety of food in the shop. 
B. Because food labels in the shop are in such a mess that they need redesigning. 
C. Because consumers desire to scan food labels for understandable information. 
D. Because consumers can hardly make sense of the information on the food labels.

Context: On the New York set of the film Hide and Seek, ten-year-old Dakota Fanning spends her time playing a deeply disturbed girl who deals with her mother's suicide   by creating an imaginary friend, who may not frighten her family.
Today, though, she has the day off. ""This week I only worked two days,""says Fanning, sitting in a sofa in her hotel's library, ""but I get bored when I'm not working. Especially because it's cold here and I can't do anything, you know? So, I've been knitting   --- all day, every day.""The actress, who's held her own opposite Oscar winners such as Sean Penn and Denzel Washington, recently mastered the fine art of scarves  . Though she's about ready to move on to hats, she first plans to make a souvenir   scarf for Robert De Niro, who plays her father in the film. ""He's the nicest guy you'd ever meet in your entire life,""she says, her voice dropping to a whisper. ""I would make him a brown one.""
Like any other fifth-grader, Fanning spends several hours a day going to school. In addition to her personal trailer   --- which is kept well-supplied with hot chocolate packets, lemon Gatorade, and a TV that doesn't always work --- she has another trailer where her teacher, Jan, conducts classes in history, spelling, reading, math, science and health. ""We have this big board where we have a calendar  ,""Fanning says. ""When we were here in January, I wrote the calendar in all blue. February was red, and March was green.""
On this particular morning, she had a spelling test. ""There was a topic for each of the word lists,""she says, sitting on her knees. ""This one was flowers --- they were all names like oxygen, carbon dioxide, chrysanthemum  ...""Chrysanthemum? ""Well, they didn't make me spell that one. They just had me fill in the 'e'.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

Context: John McCain and Barack Obama call for closer U.S.-Chinese cooperation on trade, the environment and nuclear proliferation  in the upcoming issue of an American business group's magazine. They do so in an unusual effort to  _ voters abroad.
Both articles appeared Sunday on the website of the American Chamber of Commerce  in China, and will be published in China Brief, the chamber's monthly magazine, on September 22.
Both stress that the countries should work more closely to ease trade friction , fight global warming, improve military exchanges, and block the spread of nuclear weapons to such countries as Iran and North Korea. 
""Cooperation on the key, enduring global challenges, such as climate change, can deepen understanding and enhance confidence. """"We also need to deepen high-level dialogues on a sustained basis on economic, security and global political issues"", said Obama in the article.

Context: If you go to Finland, you'll be surprised to find how ""foolish"" the Finnish people are.
Take the taxi drivers for example. Taxis in Finland are mostly high class Benz with a fare   of two US dollars a kilometer. You can go anywhere in one, tell the driver to drop you at any place, say that you have some business to attend to, and then get off without paying your fare. And the driver would not show the least sign of worry.
The dining rooms in all big hotels not only serve their guests, but also outside diners. Hotel guests have their meals free, so their good faith is to wave their registration card to the waiter. With such a loose check, you can easily use any old registration card to take a couple of friends and dine free of charge.
With so many loopholes   in everyday life, surely Finland must be a heaven to those who love to take ""pretty advantages"". But the strange things is, all the taxi-passengers would always come back to pay their fare after they have attended to their business; not a single outsider has ever been found in the free hotel dining rooms. As the Finns always act on good faith and always show an attitude of ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" in everything they do, so to live in such a society has turned everyone into a real ""gentleman"". In a society of such high moral practice, what need is there for people to take precautions   against others? 
 Question:The sentences ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" show that   _  . 
A. the Finns are foolish 
B. the Finns take things seriously 
C. the Finns are busy making money for the family 
D. the Finns never take precaution against others 
 Answer: B
Context: A company advertised in the newspaper for a sales position. Details of the prerequisite  , salary and benefits were given. It was also clearly stated that applicants needed to take an aptitude test   and an interview. However, looking at the whole advertisement, one could not find any contact information of the company.
Most interested applicants thought that it was the company's HR department's carelessness or a printing error. They therefore waited patiently for the newspaper to publish an amendment. But instead of waiting for the newspaper to publish the company details, another three applicants took the initiative to find out the company's contact information themselves.
Tim did a search on the Internet. By typing the company's name, he easily obtained all the information including its contact number. Lisa called up the local telephone number search service and found out the company's office number. She called up the office and got the required contact information. Donna put in a greater effort in her search. She remembered seeing a poster by the same company in the city so she drove all the way down and made a few rounds to search for it. She finally found it together with the company's contact information.
Three days after that advertisement was published in the newspaper, most interested applicants were still waiting eagerly for an amendment. On the other hand, the application letters and resumes of Tim, Lisa and Donna had already reached the hands of the company's HR manager. They were then called up for an interview. During the interview, all went well and immediately they were hired. The three of them were a little surprised at how fast things went on. They were expecting for an aptitude test as stated in the advertisement. The HR director answered them, smiling, ""Our test is hidden in the advertisement itself. To be a good salesperson in this age, he or she has to be broad-minded and very importantly, does not follow rigid   steps or rules. You are all clever and agile. In a short time, you've managed to find ways of contacting us. It shows clearly that you have passed the test with flying colors!""
The fools sit around waiting for their chances whereas the wise actively take actions with great initiative   . 
 Question:The writer wants to tell us through this passage that   _  . 
A. no contact information seen in an advertisement might not be the company's mistake 
B. applicants should be careful not to be fooled by the company's advertisement 
C. opportunity always belongs to whoever is active and broad-minded 
D. there are many successful chances to be found in this age

Context: The health-care economy is filled with unusual and even unique economic relationships. One of the least understood involves the peculiar roles of producer or ""provider"" and purchaser or ""consumer"" in the typical doctor-patient relationship. In most sectors of the economy, it is the seller who attempts to attract a potential buyer with various appealing factors of price, quality, and use, and it is the buyer who makes the decision. Such condition, however, is not common in most of the health-care industry.
In the health-care industry, the doctor-patient relationship is the mirror image of the ordinary relationship between producer and consumer. Once an individual has chosen to see a physician -- and even then there may be no real choice -- it is the physician who usually makes all significant purchasing decisions: whether the patient should return ""next Wednesday"", whether X-rays are needed, whether drugs should be prescribed, etc. It is rare that a patient will challenge such professional decisions or raise in advance questions about price, especially when the disease is regarded as serious.
This is particularly significant in relation to hospital care. The physician must certify the need for hospitalization, determine what procedures will be performed, and announce when the patient may be discharged. The patient may be consulted about some of the decisions, but in general it is the doctor's judgments that are final. Little wonder then that in the eye of the hospital it is the physician who is the real ""consumer"". As a consequence, the medical staff represents the ""power center"" in hospital policy and decision-making, not the administration.
Although usually there are in this situation four identifiable participants-- the physician, the hospital, the patient, and the payer (generally an insurance carrier or government)-- the physician makes the essential decisions for all of them. The hospital becomes an extension of the physician; the payer generally meets most of the bills generated by the physician/hospital, and for the most part the patient plays a passive role. We estimate that about 75-80 percent of health-care choices are determined by physicians, not patients. For this reason, the economy directed at patients or the general is relatively ineffective. 
 Question:The author's primary purpose in writing this passage is to   _  . 
A. urge hospitals to reclaim their decision-making authority 
B. inform potential patients of their health-care rights 
C. criticize doctors for exercising too much control over patients 
D. analyze some important economic factors in health-care 
 Answer: D

Context: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth.
An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, ""the worst came to the worst"". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door.
The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced.
Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank. He says the plant seeds would only be used when all other seeds are gone for some reason. Norwayfirst proposed the idea in the 1980s. But security concerns delayed the plan. At that time, the Soviet Union was meeting inRomeof the Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the above passage? 
A. The government of Norwaywill perform the project alone. 
B. Seeds to be collected there were produced ten thousands years ago. 
C. Spitsbergen is chosen because it is free of the threat unclear war forever. 
D. Temperature is a major consideration when choosing the storage place.

Context: The Norwegian Government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down (though these have already been raised); and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the Government will be able to hold things back for long. As one Norwegian politician said last week: "" We will soon be changed beyond all recognition.""
Ever since the war, the Government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. During the past few years this program has had a great deal of success. Tromso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern policy could be in ruins.
The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 percent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad.
The real argument over oil is its threat to the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it, because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as essentially Norwegian. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most critical of the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the countryside and to the sea. 
 Question:According to the passage, the oil industry might lead northern Norway to   _  . 
A. the development of industry 
B. a growth in population 
C. the failure of the development program 
D. the development of new towns

Context: If you go to Finland, you'll be surprised to find how ""foolish"" the Finnish people are.
Take the taxi drivers for example. Taxis in Finland are mostly high class Benz with a fare   of two US dollars a kilometer. You can go anywhere in one, tell the driver to drop you at any place, say that you have some business to attend to, and then get off without paying your fare. And the driver would not show the least sign of worry.
The dining rooms in all big hotels not only serve their guests, but also outside diners. Hotel guests have their meals free, so their good faith is to wave their registration card to the waiter. With such a loose check, you can easily use any old registration card to take a couple of friends and dine free of charge.
With so many loopholes   in everyday life, surely Finland must be a heaven to those who love to take ""pretty advantages"". But the strange things is, all the taxi-passengers would always come back to pay their fare after they have attended to their business; not a single outsider has ever been found in the free hotel dining rooms. As the Finns always act on good faith and always show an attitude of ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" in everything they do, so to live in such a society has turned everyone into a real ""gentleman"". In a society of such high moral practice, what need is there for people to take precautions   against others? 
 Question:The sentences ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" show that   _  . 
A. the Finns are foolish 
B. the Finns take things seriously 
C. the Finns are busy making money for the family 
D. the Finns never take precaution against others

Context: Is it time to kick Russia out of the BRICs  ? If so, it may end up sounding like a famous ball-point pen maker-BIC. An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device ,the BRICs, should really be the BICs.
""Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?"" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreigh Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of ""The Russian Balance Sheet"", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes:
""The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas. ""
Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing
far better than Russia.
But the BRICs are not just about economy. As is mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while around 80 percent is for the other three.
At very least, however, Russia's economic underperformance and stock market outperfoumance does suggest it is indeed one of the group. 
 Question:According to Aslund, Russia shouldn't be a BRIC partly because  _  . 
A. Russia's economic performance is far worse than the other three 
B. Russia's leaders are not good at managing economy 
C. Russia has taken effective measures to improve its economy 
D. Russia will no longer attract investors from other countries

Context: In 1992, I had just launched a new business called Video News International.
It was the world's first video journalist network. The idea was to cover news and sell the service to news organizations.
One day, a young intern   who was working for us named Anthony Lappe pulled me aside.
""There is something you have to see,"" he told me. ""Comcast is doing this really cool thing.""
""What?""
""The Internet,"" he said. ""It's going to be really big.""
Anthony later introduced me to the head of the Internet project.
""We are looking for content to put on our network here,"" the guy said to me.
Well, I said I had lots of content to offer.
The guy's eyes lit up. ""Cool,"" he said. ""We would like to put it on our network.""
Well, I was always looking for new clients.
""What are you going to pay?"" I asked.
He said that they could not pay anything for the content, but they would set up a URL for me.
""What's that?"" I asked.
""It's kind of like your address on the web.""
""What would I do with this URL thing?""
""Well, it could be your business.""
""I don't see how it is a business, and there's not even any advertising,"" I cleverly replied.
""Not yet,"" he said. ""But one day there might be.""
I thought about it for two seconds.
""Naah..."" I said. "" _ . I've got to be going now. Maybe we can cooperate next time.""
And I walked out.
Idiot!
Well, that Internet thing turned out to be so much bigger than I had thought. I wish I had never made such a mistake. Sorry Anthony. You were right.

Context: A company advertised in the newspaper for a sales position. Details of the prerequisite  , salary and benefits were given. It was also clearly stated that applicants needed to take an aptitude test   and an interview. However, looking at the whole advertisement, one could not find any contact information of the company.
Most interested applicants thought that it was the company's HR department's carelessness or a printing error. They therefore waited patiently for the newspaper to publish an amendment. But instead of waiting for the newspaper to publish the company details, another three applicants took the initiative to find out the company's contact information themselves.
Tim did a search on the Internet. By typing the company's name, he easily obtained all the information including its contact number. Lisa called up the local telephone number search service and found out the company's office number. She called up the office and got the required contact information. Donna put in a greater effort in her search. She remembered seeing a poster by the same company in the city so she drove all the way down and made a few rounds to search for it. She finally found it together with the company's contact information.
Three days after that advertisement was published in the newspaper, most interested applicants were still waiting eagerly for an amendment. On the other hand, the application letters and resumes of Tim, Lisa and Donna had already reached the hands of the company's HR manager. They were then called up for an interview. During the interview, all went well and immediately they were hired. The three of them were a little surprised at how fast things went on. They were expecting for an aptitude test as stated in the advertisement. The HR director answered them, smiling, ""Our test is hidden in the advertisement itself. To be a good salesperson in this age, he or she has to be broad-minded and very importantly, does not follow rigid   steps or rules. You are all clever and agile. In a short time, you've managed to find ways of contacting us. It shows clearly that you have passed the test with flying colors!""
The fools sit around waiting for their chances whereas the wise actively take actions with great initiative   . 
 Question:The writer wants to tell us through this passage that   _  . 
A. no contact information seen in an advertisement might not be the company's mistake 
B. applicants should be careful not to be fooled by the company's advertisement 
C. opportunity always belongs to whoever is active and broad-minded 
D. there are many successful chances to be found in this age

Based on the question, the option and the context select the most appropriate answer from the provided choices ""A."", ""B."", ""C."" and ""D."".
Context: Cyberspace, data superhighway, multimedia, for those who have seen the future, and the linking of computers, televisions and telephones will change our lives for ever. Yet for all the talks of a forthcoming technological utopia, little attention has been given to the implications of these developments for the poor. As for all the new high technology, the West concerns itself with the ""how"", while the question of ""for whom"" is put aside once again.
Economists are only now realizing the full extent to which the communication revolution has affected the world economy. Information technology allows the extension of trade across geographical and industrial boundaries, and transnational corporations take full advantage of it. Terms of trade and exchange, interest rates and money movements are more important than the production of goods. The electronic economy made by information technology allows the haves to increase their control on global markets -- with a destructive impact on the havenots.
For them the result is unstable. Developing countries which rely on the production of a small range of goods for export are made to feel like small parts in the international economic machine. As ""futures"" are traded on computer screens, developing countries simply have less and less control of their destinies.
So what are the options of regaining control?One alternative for developing countries is to buy in the latest computers and telecommunications. Yet this leads to long-term dependency and perhaps permanent constraints ( ,) on developing countries' economies.
Communication technology is generally exported from the US, Europe or Japan;the patents, skills and ability remain in the hands of a few industrialized countries. It is also expensive, therefore imported products and services must be bought on credit usually provided by the very countries whose companies stand to gain. 
 Question:It can be inferred from the passage that   _   . 
A. international trade should be expanded 
B. the interests of the poor countries have not been given enough consideration 
C. the exports of the poor countries should be increased 
D. communication technology in developing countries should be modernized 
 Answer: B
Context: John McCain and Barack Obama call for closer U.S.-Chinese cooperation on trade, the environment and nuclear proliferation  in the upcoming issue of an American business group's magazine. They do so in an unusual effort to  _ voters abroad.
Both articles appeared Sunday on the website of the American Chamber of Commerce  in China, and will be published in China Brief, the chamber's monthly magazine, on September 22.
Both stress that the countries should work more closely to ease trade friction , fight global warming, improve military exchanges, and block the spread of nuclear weapons to such countries as Iran and North Korea. 
""Cooperation on the key, enduring global challenges, such as climate change, can deepen understanding and enhance confidence. """"We also need to deepen high-level dialogues on a sustained basis on economic, security and global political issues"", said Obama in the article.
McCain agreed that the cooperation with prefix = st1 /Chinawould be essential in addressing issues of global concern. ""TheUnited Statesshares common interests withChinathat can form the basis of a strong partnership on issues of global concern, including climate change, trade and proliferation,"" he added. ""and I hope to see our relationship develop in a manner that benefits both countries and, in turn, the Asia-Pacific region and the world,"" he noted.
Both candidates  were impressed by China's economic success.
""Chinahas achieved extraordinary, sustained growth over the past three decades. Hundreds of millions of people inChinalive better now than most thought possible even two decades ago,"" Obama said.
""China's double-digit growth rates have brought hundreds of millions out of poverty, energized the economies of its neighbors and produced many new economic opportunities,"" McCain said.
Gao Wenhuan, 21st Century Online's special reporter, interviewed Marshall M. Bouton, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. ""My guess is, regardless of who is elected in November, you will hear basically the same description that Chinais a strategic partner and competitor,"" said Bouton.
A survey conducted by the Council in July 2008 found that the majority of respondents clearly admired China's accomplishments, but some Americans viewedChina's rising global power as a threat. According to the survey,Chinanow is seen as the most influential country in the world following theU.S..

C. high-level dialogues on economic, security and global political issues 
D. China's rising global power

Context: In 2007.five young people in the American state of Massachusetts developed an idea. The team knew that the world is filled with mobile phones.About eighty percent of all people are said to live within reach of a wireless telephone signal.    
    The idea was to use mobile phones and the Internet to connect job seekers with employers.The young people wrote a business plan and formed a company called Assured Labor.
    Assured Labor won a development competition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Three of the founders were graduate students there.    '
    Assured Labo is an electronic market place.It has two parts.One is for;the United States.That operation was launched in January in Boston.It links people with employees offering temporary jobs.
    The other arm of the business is for developing markets.That operation is meant to help people get mbfe permanent jobs.A representative is currently building partnerships with universities,and international companies in Central America.
    Assured Labor's president David Reich,says the companies now place job advertisements on radio or in newspapers.Some even drive around in cars with loudspeakers announcing that jobs are available.He says the companies are interested.in having more modem hiring practices.
    Through Assured Labor, companies will list open positions on the Internet.People who think
 they could do the job could reply by text messages or on their cellophanes.
    This is how the system works inprefix = st1 /Boston.
The jobs available include house cleaning.Dog walking and home repay. People who want their house cleaned,for example,can look online at a list of twenty housekeepers.The list tells what services.they offer,and how much they want to be paid.People need two letters praising their work to get on the list of service providers.
    The employer chooses workers they would like jot hire ,The company then sends the workers a text or e-mail message so they can respond quickly to an offer.
    After a job is completed,the employer and employee rate each other, The rating is kept for  future use.Assured Labor is not charging anyone,right now, but the plan is to have employers pay for the service. 
 Question:what kinds of jobs does Assured Labor offer? 
A. Temporary jobs. 
B. Permanent jobs. 
C. Free jobs 
D. Both A and B*

Context: My summer hols wr CWOT. B4, we usd 2 go 2 NY 2C my bro, his CF & thr 3:-@ kids FTF ILNY, its gr8.
Can you understand this sentence? If you can't, don't feel too bad: neither could the middle school teacher in England who received this as homework. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cellphones. To newcomers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the ""translation"" of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York; it's great.
Schoolteachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes cxan be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted .
Everyone should just relax, say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nunberg, from Stanford University, agrees. ""People get better at writing by writing,"" he says, ""Kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mail, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than, their parents.""
Linguist James Millroy says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can bet your bottom dollar that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents, they too will think this way. Milroy argues that languages do not and cannot become ""corrupted""; they simply change to meet the new needs.
However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write Standard English. Cynthia McVey says, ""I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but that learning to write proper English is a must for their future.""
Perhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway. Erin, age 12, says, ""I wouldn't use text language in my homework. Texting is just for fun""

Context: When you buy a T-shirt, or a fur coat in a store, it often carries a label telling who made it or from what store it was bought. Instead, some labels show the dress is famous and it is very expensive, so buyers secretly wish they could be carried forever. On the other hand, buyers who deal with the cheapest products would be pleased to be away with labels  _ .
However, there is another label more important than the one showing from which store the dress was bought. When a person buys a fur coat, or a jacket from a store, a label telling what the product is made of should be carried to it.
The label is required by law. Besides telling what the product on show is made of, the label should be in clear English and be where one can find it easily. The information on the label must be true.
The reason for this is that most buyers today aren't expert enough to know exactly what kind of fur or material they are buying. The buyers must believe in the store that sells the products or in what the label says. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE? 
A. A T-shirt seldom carries a label. 
B. A fur coat with a high price often carries a false label. 
C. A label only says what material the product is made of. 
D. Not all buyers know the materials they are buying.

Context: The Norwegian Government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down (though these have already been raised); and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the Government will be able to hold things back for long. As one Norwegian politician said last week: "" We will soon be changed beyond all recognition.""
Ever since the war, the Government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. During the past few years this program has had a great deal of success. Tromso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern policy could be in ruins.
The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 percent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad.
The real argument over oil is its threat to the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it, because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as essentially Norwegian. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most critical of the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the countryside and to the sea. 
 Question:According to the passage, the oil industry might lead northern Norway to   _  . 
A. the development of industry 
B. a growth in population 
C. the failure of the development program 
D. the development of new towns 
 Answer: C
Context: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth.
An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, ""the worst came to the worst"". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door.
The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced.
Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank. He says the plant seeds would only be used when all other seeds are gone for some reason. Norwayfirst proposed the idea in the 1980s. But security concerns delayed the plan. At that time, the Soviet Union was meeting inRomeof the Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the above passage? 
A. The government of Norwaywill perform the project alone. 
B. Seeds to be collected there were produced ten thousands years ago. 
C. Spitsbergen is chosen because it is free of the threat unclear war forever. 
D. Temperature is a major consideration when choosing the storage place.

Context: 2009 is the year of what? Yes, it's the year of the Ox. But do you know that 2009 is also the year of the telescope? This year the world celebrates the 400thanniversary of Galileo's observations of the universe through an astronomical telescope  . In 1609, the Italian scientist first pointed a ""Dutch perspective glass"" at the night sky and made discoveries that changed mankind's conceptions of the universe. 
In honor of Galileo's discoveries, the United Nations and the International Astronomical Union have declared 2009 to be the International Year of Astronomy (IYA 2009).
IYA 2009 is a yearlong celebration of astronomy. Its goal is to spread knowledge of astronomy's contributions to society and culture and to inspire more interest in astronomy and science, especially among young people. The theme of the celebration is ""The Universe, Yours to Discover.""
One interesting aim of the IYA is to encourage more diversity   in the field of astronomy and physics. IYA organizers hope that the yearlong celebration of astronomy will inspire more females and underrepresented minorities to pursue   careers in science. An event that will help further that goal is 100 Hours of Astronomy (100 HA) that will fall on April. This event aims to have as many people as possible look through a telescope. From April 2ndto 5th, millions of people worldwide will peer through telescopes to catch their first glimpse   of the universe, just as Galileo's did 400 years ago. Sidewalk astronomy events will give city-dwellers   an excellent opportunity to see the moon, the planet Saturn, and other objects in position for early evening observations. 
Organizers hope that the activities of IYA will ""promote   a greater appreciation of the astronomy."" So join the fun. Look through a telescope this year!

Context: Doubt usually comes along when companies talk very proudly how socially responsible they are, but Nike's decision to publish its entire list of contract suppliers on the Internet is harder to ignore. Nike's move opens a new front in companies' efforts to face their critics.
As Nike states in its latest corporate responsibility report, it is often hard to confirm exactly what is happening at about 800 factories that make its footwear and clothing under contract, many of which are remote.
Nike is hoping other companies will publish their factory lists, too. Hannah Jones, Nike's vice - president for corporate responsibility, says Nike would like to see the best - run contract factories using their social position as suppliers to the big brands to try to get more work.
Nike's approach moves corporate responsibility into its third age. The first age was corporate philanthropy - companies donating money to various community projects. The $170,   000,000 that Wal - Mart gave in charitable donations last year is a good example. Of course, some critics oppose even this form of corporate generosity , arguing that companies should concentrate on making profits, leaving it to shareholders to decide what charitable donations to make.
Corporate responsibility's second age was reputation management and risk avoidance. Second - age corporate responsibility supporters believe agreement with the wider community can warn a company of future risks in advance.
Nike is now trying to go a stage further. The company says it sees corporate responsibility as a way of improving its performance rather than just protecting its reputation. Factories which ensure that workers are registered  for social - security benefits often become more productive as a result. Attention to one aspect of staff management often leads to improvement in others.
If other companies publish supplier lists, they can together work out common standards, Nike says. At present, different companies have different standards, which make life difficult for the many factories that produce for more than one brand. If other companies published suppliers' locations, they could work out common standards and save money by relying on one another's checks. 
 Question:What effect could Nike's action have on its contract suppliers? 
A. Their managers will win promotion they desire. 
B. They will get donations from big brands easily. 
C. There's no need for their factories to be checked. 
D. They may have more opportunities to make money. 
 Answer: B
Context: ""We don't necessarily believe that new advertising, which might make consumers feel better about the Coke brand or better about the ads themselves , will actually result in consumers consuming more of the product,"" Morgan Stanley's Bill Pecoriello wrote in a research note the days after the investor   meeting . But Coke is optimistic it can regain its old magic, and is banking on a new slogan: ""Welcome to the Coke side of life.""
BREAK THROUGH HIT? 
With PepsiCo about to surpass  Coke as the beverage king on Wall Street--Pepsi's market capitalization has  _ in recent years to $97.9 billion, putting it less than a billion dollars behind its rival--the heat is on Coke . It's set to launch a new marketing campaign in March, 2006. And having taken a quick look at Coke's investor presentation on Dec. 7 in New York, my sense is that Coke may be moving in the right direction .
Given the continued shift by consumers away from soda--Coke's stronghold --and into alternative beverages like juice, tea, and water, Coke badly needs a breakthrough hit. And given that shift away from soda, some analyists wonder whether even the catchiest new ads will be enough to put the fizz back into Coke.
SAME OLD, UPDATED?
    The new flavors of PowerAde sports drink will probably enable Coke to continue stealing market share from PepsiCo's Gatorade brand. And Coke is getting a little more creative with packaging, including new, aluminum bottles of Coke that will be sold in nightclubs, and an 8.4-ounce ""100 calorie"" version of its flagship Coke that will appeal to women who want fewer calories and will like the fact that the small can will fit in their purse. I doubt whether other new products will be successful, including a new coffee-flavored soda called Coke-Cola Black that I tried. Think carbonated coffee. But I'm not sure if the product, which Coke is pitching as an afternoon pick-me-up for the 35-and-over set, is going to pull people away from their afternoon Frappucino fix. And my opinion is that Vault, an orange-flavored energy drink, will have just as much trouble unseating Mountain Dew among teens as did Coke's last attempt, a product called Surge.
If there is one concern I have about the fresh offerings Coke plans to launch this year, it appears that many of them are simply new brands, not new products. 
 Question:According to the passage, we can know that   _  . 
A. Coke mainly depends on new products recently 
B. Nowadays Coke is comparatively less popular 
C. PepsiCo has taken the place of Coke 
D. Coke has few new brands 
 Answer: B
Context: John McCain and Barack Obama call for closer U.S.-Chinese cooperation on trade, the environment and nuclear proliferation  in the upcoming issue of an American business group's magazine. They do so in an unusual effort to  _ voters abroad.
Both articles appeared Sunday on the website of the American Chamber of Commerce  in China, and will be published in China Brief, the chamber's monthly magazine, on September 22.
Both stress that the countries should work more closely to ease trade friction , fight global warming, improve military exchanges, and block the spread of nuclear weapons to such countries as Iran and North Korea. 
""Cooperation on the key, enduring global challenges, such as climate change, can deepen understanding and enhance confidence. """"We also need to deepen high-level dialogues on a sustained basis on economic, security and global political issues"", said Obama in the article.

Both candidates  were impressed by China's economic success.
""Chinahas achieved extraordinary, sustained growth over the past three decades. Hundreds of millions of people inChinalive better now than most thought possible even two decades ago,"" Obama said.
""China's double-digit growth rates have brought hundreds of millions out of poverty, energized the economies of its neighbors and produced many new economic opportunities,"" McCain said.
Gao Wenhuan, 21st Century Online's special reporter, interviewed Marshall M. Bouton, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. ""My guess is, regardless of who is elected in November, you will hear basically the same description that Chinais a strategic partner and competitor,"" said Bouton.
A survey conducted by the Council in July 2008 found that the majority of respondents clearly admired China's accomplishments, but some Americans viewedChina's rising global power as a threat. According to the survey,Chinanow is seen as the most influential country in the world following theU.S..

C. high-level dialogues on economic, security and global political issues 
D. China's rising global power

Context: Do you still get free plastic bags  from the supermarket ? Things will change soon.
To protect  the environment, supermarkets in China will stop providing   free plastic bags after June 1st. If you don't want to pay money to buy them, you'll have to bring your own shopping bag.
What kind of bags will be the best to bring? Students in Kunming Xinying Middle School have some good ideas.
Recently 54 students of the school held an activity in which they made their own environmentally-friendly shopping bags.
Most students used old clothes to make their bags. They painted pictures like the Olympic rings on them.
But Wang Shuncheng, a Junior 2 boy, chose a different material  . He made his bag with old newspaper. Is a newspaper bag strong enough to hold shopping? Wang says it is, ""No problem. I put six bottles of water in the bag,"" he said. ""It's strong enough!""
Chen Lisi, a girl, had a more traditional way to make her bag - she weaved   a bamboo basket. It was not an easy job. With her grandfather's help, Chen spent a whole afternoon making it. She also weaved wool   flowers on the basket.
Making bags was not all the students did. They had another job: to persuade their parents and relatives to use environmentally-friendly shopping bags instead of plastic ones. The school will show the bags so that shops and stores can get inspiration   from the students' work. 
 Question:Supermarkets in China stop providing plastic bags because   _  . 
A. they want to save money 
B. markets want to make more money 
C. plastic bags are very expensive 
D. they want to protect the environment 
 Answer: D
Context: A philosophy professor stood before his class with some items on the table in front of him. When the class began, wordlessly he picked up a very large and empty jar and started to fill it with rocks. He then asked the students if the jar was full. They agreed that it was. So the professor then picked up a box of _ and poured them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas between the rocks. He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was. The professor picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand filled up everything else. He then asked once more if the jar was full. The students responded with ""Yes.""
""Now,"" said the professor, ""I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life. The rocks are the important things - your family, your partner, your health, your children - things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be full. The pebbles are the other things that matter - like your job, your house, your car. The sand is everything else. The small stuff."" ""If you put the sand into the jar first,"" he continued ""there is no room for the pebbles or the rocks. The same goes for your life.
If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness. Play with your children. Take your partner out dancing. There will always be time to go to work, clean the house, and give a dinner party. Take care of the rocks first - the things that really matter. Set your priorities . The rest is just sand."" 
 Question:What did the professor think were the most important things in his life?

Context: It was Molly's job to hand her father his brown paper lunch bag each morning before he headed off to work.
One morning, in addition to his usual lunch bag, Molly handed him a second paper bag. This one was worn and held together with staples   . 
""Why two bags?"" her father asked. ""The other is something else,"" Molly answered. ""What's in it?"" ""Just some stuff. Take it with you.""
Not wanting to discuss the matter, he put both bags into his briefcase, kissed Molly and rushed off. At midday he opened Molly's bag and took out the contents: two hair ribbons , three small stones, a plastic dinosaur, a tiny sea shell, a small doll, and 13 pennies... The busy father smiled, finished eating, and swept the desk clean into the wastebasket, Molly's stuff included.
That evening, Molly ran up behind him as he read the paper. ""Where's my bag?"" ""What bag?"" ""The one I gave you this morning."" ""I left it at the office. Why?"" ""I forgot to put this note in it,"" she said. ""And, besides, Daddy, the things in the sack are the things I really like -- I thought you might like to play with them. You didn't lose the bag, did you, Daddy?"" ""Oh, no,"" he said, lying. ""I just forgot to bring it home. I'll bring it tomorrow."" While Molly hugged her father's neck, he unfolded the note that read: ""I love you, Daddy."" Molly had given him her treasures -- all that a 7-year-old held dear.
Love in a paper bag, and he missed it -- not only missed it, but had thrown it in the wastebasket. So back he went to the office. Just ahead of the night janitor , he picked up the wastebasket. He put the treasures inside and carried it home carefully. The bag didn't look so good, but the stuff was all there and that's what counted.
After dinner, he asked Molly to tell him about the stuff in the sack. It took a long time to tell. Everything had a story or a memory.
""Sometimes I think of all the great times in this sweet life,"" he thought.
We should all remember that it's not the destination that counts in life, but the journey. That journey with the people we love is all that really matters. It is such a simple truth but it is so easily forgotten.

Context: Every morning Molly gave her father the lunch bag before he set off for work. 
One morning,besides his usual lunch bag.Molly handed him a second paper bag.
""Why two bags?""her father asked.
""The other is something else, ""Molly answered.
""What's in it?""asked her father.
""Just some stuff.Take it with you.""Molly replied.
Not wanting to discuss the matter, put both bags into his briefcase, he kissed Molly and rushed off.At midday he opened Molly's bag and took out the contents:three small stones, a plastic dinosaur,a tiny seashell,a small doll,and 13 pennies...The busy lather smiled,finished eating, and swept the desk clean into the wastebasket.Molly's stuff included.
That evening,Molly ran up behind him as he was reading a newspaper.
""Where's my bag,Daddy?""asked Molly.
""What bag?""her father responded.
""The one I gave you this morning, ""said Molly.
""I left it at the office.Why?""said her father.
""I forgot to put this note in it, ""Molly said. ""and besides,Daddy,the things in the sack are those I really like-I thought you might like to play with them.You didn't lose the bag,did you, Daddy?""
""Oh,no, ""he said,lying.""I just forgot to bring it home.I'll bring it tomorrow."" 
While Molly hugged her father' neck, unfolded the note that read, love you.  s he ""I Daddy. "" Molly had given him her treasures--all that a 7-year-old girl held dear.
Love in a paper bag,but he missed it--not only missed it,but had thrown it in the wastebasket. So back he went to the office.Just ahead of the night guard,he picked up the paper bag. He put the treasures inside and carried it home carefully.The bag didn't look SO good,but the stuff was all there and that was of great importance.
After dinner,he asked Molly to tell him about the stuff in the sack. It took a long time to tell.Everything had a story or a memory.
""Sometimes I think of all the great times in this sweet life, ""he thought.
We should all cherish the moment with the people we love.That's what really matters. It's so simple and so easily forgotten.

A. He kept it in the drawer. 
B. He took it back home. 
C. He threw it into the wastebasket. 
D. He put it on his table.

Context: Recently, I experienced a wonderful lesson in how little things still mean a lot. My brother, mother and I live in a very rural district on the Big Island of Hawaii. Our farm is at least a dozen miles from the most basic of services. Consequently, we take weekly trips to COSTCO to procure fuel and supplies. About a month ago, we'd finished loading up the SUV and prepared to leave. As I settled into my seat, I glanced down at the roadside, when a piece of paper caught my eye. I picked it up and read it carefully. Instantly, I was grateful I did.
The form turned out to be a receipt from the State Motor Vehicle Division, documenting the owners' payment of their Vehicle's Registration fees. Quickly, I put myself in their shoes and figured: no one would throw this out, especially if it was current. I also looked over the form for contact or any personal data, perhaps a license tag or telephone number. But that seemed impractical. Although the form had been born on the wind, where in the busy, crowded parking lot would I find the owners? Had it been lying there for a few minutes or a week? So I checked the date, the fees paid, noted the names of the owners and pocketed the receipt. Recalling the parable of the Good Samaritan, I concluded that the best and easiest step to take was to put the form in an envelope addressed to the couple and send it to them by post. Further, I imagined how crazy I'd be if I had misplaced my receipt. Much easier to attempt returning it than to leave them angry, upset, etc. over the loss.
By the end of the week, I received a beautiful thank-you letter from a very grateful and happy couple containing a hand written message and a gift card to use at any Starbuck's. In her note, the wife explained how a gust of wind snatched their receipt from a pocket in her car's passenger door. They had panicked and searched crazily for quite some time before giving up. It felt great to know I'd helped someone avoid a major loss by doing something that at first glance seemed minor or even unimportant. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the short passage? 
A. I rode my car to COSTCO to buy supplies a month ago. 
B. The receipt was out of date, so the owner threw it away. 
C. I waited on the roadside for the receipt owner for half a day. 
D. I called up the owner to take back the receipt. 
 Answer: A
Context: My life plan is to visit all the states in the US. Several years ago, my husband and I were traveling in the northwest. One day, when we were having our breakfast, I lost my wallet that had over $300 in it. There was no way for us to be able to find it, but we went on with our trip.
We went off to drive around and enjoy the city, completely forgetting my missing wallet. Later on, when I checked my phone, there was a message from the boss of the restaurant where we had our breakfast:
""I have something that belongs to you, and you're going to be very happy.""
We got back to the restaurant and there was the wallet on the table with all the money in it!
The boss's son found the wallet in front of the door, and brought it to him. He thought that it must belong to someone who had a meal in the restaurant, so he checked inside and found my phone number on a piece of paper. 
 Question:According to the passage, we can say that   _  . 
A. the writer always lost things during her trips 
B. the message was a good surprise to the writer 
C. the wallet was not important for the writer 
D. the writer didn't mind that she had lost her wallet 
 Answer: B
Context: When you buy a T-shirt, or a fur coat in a store, it often carries a label telling who made it or from what store it was bought. Instead, some labels show the dress is famous and it is very expensive, so buyers secretly wish they could be carried forever. On the other hand, buyers who deal with the cheapest products would be pleased to be away with labels  _ .
However, there is another label more important than the one showing from which store the dress was bought. When a person buys a fur coat, or a jacket from a store, a label telling what the product is made of should be carried to it.
The label is required by law. Besides telling what the product on show is made of, the label should be in clear English and be where one can find it easily. The information on the label must be true.
The reason for this is that most buyers today aren't expert enough to know exactly what kind of fur or material they are buying. The buyers must believe in the store that sells the products or in what the label says. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE? 
A. A T-shirt seldom carries a label. 
B. A fur coat with a high price often carries a false label. 
C. A label only says what material the product is made of. 
D. Not all buyers know the materials they are buying. 
 Answer: D
Context: In March 2004, Joe Ryan got a collection notice from a billing agency for Littleton Adventist Hospital near prefix = st1 /Denver,Colorado. The hospital wanted payment for surgery totaling $41,188. Ryan had never set foot in that hospital. Obviously there was some mistake. ""I thought it was a joke,"" says Ryan.
But when he called the billing agency, nobody laughed. Someone named Joe Ryan, using Ryan's Social Security number, had indeed been admitted for surgery. He figured clearing this up would take just a few phone calls. 
Two years later, Ryan continues to suffer from the damage to his credit rating and still doesn't know if his medical record has been cleared of wrong information. 
Joe Ryan was the victim of a little-known but frightening type of consumer fraud that is on the rise: medical identity theft, which involves using your name to get drugs, expensive medical treatment and even cheating insurance payments. 
As Ryan discovered, money isn't the half of it. When someone steals your name to receive health care, his medical history becomes part of your record -- and setting the record straight can be extremely difficult. That's because, in part, the information is distributed among dozens of caregivers, from doctors to medicine stores to insurance companies and labs.
""I wanted to help straighten this out,"" says Ryan, ""so I went to the hospital, and they had a three-inch-thick record for me, but they wouldn't let me see it. I showed them my ID, and they said that's not Joe Ryan's signature. Well, of course not! They had this other guy's signature."" 
Ryan had fallen into a victim's Catch-22: If your record doesn't appear to be yours, you may not have the right to see it, much less change it.
Ryan's next step was a visit to the Police Department. But the cops concluded there was not much they could do; local law enforcement has little experience with medical ID theft, and cases can end up being considered a civil matter. 
 Question:At first Joe Ryan thought his problem was   _  . 
A. easy to settle 
B. difficult to settle 
C. impossible to solve 
D. unnecessary to solve

Context: I do desire to help my Chinese students to find a better way of learning. I once divided my Chinese MBA students into six groups and set them an assignment: brainstorming on ""two-hour business plans"", for example: a restaurant chain. Originality would be valued most. As a result, five groups proposed projects for restaurant chains. The sixth showed a catering service. I couldn't help expressing my disappointment, though the time limit had been rather challenging.
Those middle managers and financial analysts from state-owned enterprises and global companies were not untalented or without opinions, but they had been accustomed to an educational system that rarely rewarded critical thinking or Originality. Papers were often copied from the Internet and the Harvard Business Review. Students insisted that copying was a superior business strategy, better than inventing and creating.
In China, you can see almost all kinds of products you can imagine have been made and sold, but so few well developed marketing and management minds have been produced that it will be a long time before most people in the world can name a Chinese brand!
Partnerships with institutions like Yale and MIT have been established so as to solve the problem mentioned above. And there's also the ""thousand talent scheme"": this new government program is designed to improve technological modernization by inviting top foreign trained scientists to the mainland with large sums of money. But there are concerns about China's research environment, which is known for lacking in encouraging independent thinking and inventiveness, and even high salary offers may not be attractive enough to overcome this.
If China wants to become a major world creator, it is no good just seeking partnerships with top Western universities or gathering a group of well-educated people and telling them to think creatively. It's time to establish a rich learning environment for young minds. Yes, new way of learning is the key! 
 Question:The author feels disappointed when the students hand in their plans because  _ 
A. there's one group presenting a catering service. 
B. all groups followed his idea of restaurant chains. 
C. the students' ideas were lacking in creativeness. 
D. the time limit had been rather challenging.

Context: I will never forget the tenth summer of childhood with my grandfather in western Norway at the mountain farm where my mother was born. As a boy ,I always thought people simply bought whatever they need. Whether Grandfather knew this, I don't know. One day he said, ""Come, I have something for you.""
I followed him to a workroom. ""You should have a toy boat. You can sail it at Storvassdal."" He said. Great, I thought,looking around for the boat. But there was none.
Grandfather pointed to a block of wood. ""The boat is in there,"" he said. Then he handed me some tools and showed me how to use them properly. ""It'll be a fine boat,and you'll make it with your own hands,"" he said,""No one can give you what you do for yourself."" The words rang in my head as I worked. Finished the boat. It wasn't much to look at ,but I was poud. Then I sailed it at Storvassdal.
We had to return to America. ""You cannot bring that boat home with you,"" my mother said. We already had too much baggage. Feeling sad, I hid my boat under a big rock at Storvassdal.

I returned to the lake in 1968,1971,1977 and 1988. Each time I had the boat and carved the year,my grandfather seemed near.
My last trip to Storvassdal was in 1991. I brought my granddaughters: Catherine,13; Claire,12. I hoped they would understand the importance of the little boat and its simple message. At Storvassdal, Claire said softly, 'Grandpa,someday I'll come back.' She added,""And I'll bring my children.""

Context: San Francisco has its cable cars. Seattle has its Space Needle. And, Longview has its squirrel bridge. The bridge, which has attracted international attention, is now a local landmark.
The Nutty Narrows Bridge was built in 1963 by a local builder, Amos Peters, to give squirrels a way to cross the busy road without getting flattened by passing cars.
The original bridge was built over Olympia Way on the west edge of the library grounds. Before the bridge was built, squirrels had to avoid traffic to and from the Park Plaza office building where office staff put out a nutty feast for the squirrels. Many times, Peters and others who worked in and near Park Plaza witnessed squirrels being run over.
One day Peters found a dead squirrel with a nut still in its mouth, and that day's coffee break discussion turned into squirrel safety. The group of businessmen cooked up the squirrel bridge idea and formed a committee to ask the blessing of the City Council .The Council approved, and Councilwoman Bess LaRiviere named the bridge ""Nutty Narrows.""
After architects designed the bridge, Amos Peters and Bill Hutch started Construction, They built the 60-foot bridge from aluminum and lengths of fire hose . It cost 1,000.
It didn't take long before reports of squirrels using the bridge started. Squirrels were even seen guiding their young and teaching them the ropes. The story was picked up by the media, and Nutty Narrows became know in newspapers all over the world.
In 1983, after 20 years of use, Peters took down the worn-out bridge. Repairs were made and crosspieces were replaced. The faded sign was repainted and in July 1983, hundreds of animal lovers attended the completion ceremony of the new bridge.
Peters died in 1984, and a ten-foot wooden squirrel sculpture was placed near the bridge in memory of its builder and his devotion to the project. 
 Question:What happened over the coffee break discussion? 
A. The committee got the Council's blessing. 
B. The squirrel bridge idea was born 
C. A councilwoman named the bridge 
D. A squirrel was found dead.

Context: The world is not only hungry, it will also be thirsty for water. About 97% of water on the earth is sea water, or salty  water. Man can only drink or use the other 3% of the fresh water  which comes from rivers, lakes and underground.
The sea is very big. Look at the map of the world, there is more sea than land. It covers  quarters of the earth, it looks very beautiful when the sun is shinning on it. But it can be terrible when there is a strong wind. Some parts of the sea are very deep. There is one place near Japan. It's nearly 11 kilometers high. If we put that mountain into the sea at that place, there would be 2 kilometers of water above it!
The sea is salty. There is one ""sea"" called the Dead Sea. The Dead Sea is not a sea. It's a big lake in the Jordan Valley. It's the saltiest. It's near the city of Jericho. It's about 80.kilometres long, between 4.8 and 17.7 kilometers wide. The river Jordan runs into the Dead Sea. The sun is not there and the water is salty. Fish can't live in the Dead Sea and plants can't grow near it. People can't swim well in the Dead Sea, but they can float  on the water. The water is very blue and the air is clean. In winter, people come to the Dead Sea to enjoy the sunshine. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the following isn't true? 
A. The river Jordan runs into the Dead Sea. 
B. The world will only be thirsty. 
C. The sea looks beautiful when the sun-is shining on it. 
D. The Dead Sea is the saltiest lake in the world.

Context: Future history books might record that we were robbed of the use of our eyes ,In our hurry to get from one place to another, we fail to see anything on the way, Air travel gives you a bird's -eye view of the world ---or even less if the wing of the aircraft happens to _ When you travel by car or train , you are moving so quickly that you do not see the countryside clearly , Car drivers are forever thinking about going on and on; they never want to stop, Is it the great motorways ,that attract them, or what? And as for sea travel ,it hardly deserves mention ,It is perfectly summed up in the words of the old song:'I joined the navy to see the world ,and what did I see? I saw the sea'. You mention the place names in the world like EI Dorado, Kabul and someone is sure to say'I've been there'meaning ,'I drove through it at 100 miles an hour on the way to somewhere else.'

By traveling like this, you suspend  all experience; the present stops being a reality:you might just as well be dead.
The traveler on foot, on the other hand , lives constantly in the present, For him traveling and arriving are one and the same thing: he arrives somewhere with every step he makes, He experiences, the present moment with his eyes, his ears and the whole of his body, At the end of his journey he feels a delicious physical tiredness, Satisfying sleep will be his: the just reward of all true travelers. 
 Question:Why does ""the present""mean ""nothing ""when we travel at high speeds? 
A. Because we change our aims all the time 
B. Because we are eager to go to another place 
C. Because we are looking forward to the future life 
D. Because we cannot enjoy the experience we have had

Context: A new report says sea ice in the Arctic Ocean is melting more quickly than expected. American scientists say the ice is melting even faster than computer programs had estimated.
Scientists know that climate change has a major effect on the Arctic Ocean partly because sea ice is disappearing. They also know that areas of open seawater are expanding. Such areas are known to take in sunlight and increase temperatures. Scientists say this has helped to cause the loss of the Arctic's ice cover.
For the study, the American scientists compared eighteen computer programs with observations made by satellites and other instruments. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change used the computer programs to prepare its 2007 estimates of climate change.
The computer programs gave estimates of the amount of ice in the Arctic Ocean in the month of September. September is when the Arctic has the least ice, after the warm, summer months. The computer estimates suggested an ice loss of two and a half percent for every ten-year period between 1953 and 2006.
Newer studies of the Arctic have used information gathered by aircraft, satellites and ships. This information showed a loss of September ice cover of almost eight percent for every ten-year period between 1953 and last year. This means the ice is disappearing about thirty years faster than the computer programs estimated.
The scientists say the programs might not have recognized the full effect of increased carbon dioxide and other gases in Earth's atmosphere. They say their study suggests the gases may have more of an effect than had been thought. 
 Question:It is reported that sea ice in the Arctic Ocean is melting more quickly than expected mainly because   _  . 
A. climate change 
B. sea ice's disappearance 
C. seawater's expansion 
D. the loss of the Arctic's ice cover 
 Answer: A
Context: Masses of floating ice are so large that they dwarfs your ship, making you question whether your ship still can be spotted among such floating mountains. They are so improbable looking that you simply look in wonder. It seems that nothing that large could be natural-- and then it strikes you that something so large could only be natural.  
Now, people realize that as climate change is raising global temperatures, more icebergs are being born. Antarctica creates far more of them than Greenland, the source of bergs in Arctic waters. Antarctica's are also much larger, sometimes reaching the size of small countries. Recent data show the average atmospheric temperature has increased about 4.5degF in the western Antarctic Peninsula since the 1940s, making the region, among the fastest warming on earth. This jump has been shown in the recent breaking of major ice shelves along the Antarctic Peninsula. As a result, thousands of new icebergs have broken off, from ice shelves into the Southern Ocean at an accelerated rate.
Even as more icebergs are being created, scientists are learning that these beauties are far from inactive masses of ice. In fact, they strikingly alter their environments biologically, chemically, and physically, making them islands of life in the open sea. Observers at sea had long remarked that they attract seals, and seabirds, and divers had noticed that fish are more numerous near them than in the surrounding sea. Now scientists are learning just what the attraction is all about.
Depending on their size, location, and the season, icebergs can be nurturers or destroyers. During their existence--typically years from breaking off from an Antarctic or Greenlandic glacier to their gradual melting as they float into lower altitudes, they support animals on, around, even inside their splendid ice castle. They fertilize the ocean with nutrients, increasing sea creature production. Grounded bergs can shelter areas of the seafloor, protecting bottom-living creatures from free-floating icebergs. However, large bergs can also trap sea ice, preventing its annual breakup and thus stopping phytoplankton from getting life-giving sunlight, breaking the food chain at its first link. ...
Icebergs will continue to astonish and attract visitors to the polar regions with their size and extraordinary beauty. But now these frozen masses are taking on a new dimension of wonder as we uncover their vital role in the environment of polar seas. No longer can we look at icebergs as mere passive beauties. They are active agents of change, each one an icy oasis with a wake of life as it floats on its unstoppable oceanic journey to melting. 
 Question:From the passage we can conclude that icebergs can   _  . 
A. preserve ocean life 
B. carry ocean nutrients away 
C. create a warm polar environment 
D. keep sea animals away from polar seas 
 Answer: A
Context: Experts estimate that one out of every five fish sold was caught illegally. It threatens  food security and hurts the environment. Officials are using new observational technology to fight illegal fishing.
""Thank you for taking the time to join us here in Harwell (UK) in the Operations Center to what we call 'Project Eyes on the Seas.'"" says Tony Long, who leads the Ending Illegal Fishing program for Pew Charitable Trusts. The group created Project Eyes on the Seas. Large three-dimensional images of a globe can be seen on a video.
""It looks different from what you might expect because this globe only shows you the boats that are coming into this system from a live automated information system or AIS.""
The screen shows 120,000 fishing boats have AIS. They are required to have the technology. But those who are fishing illegally often turn it off. The technology does not tell observers when that happens. Project Eyes on the Seas combines satellite information with secret government records on every ship's past activities.
Mr. Long says that permits researchers to understand exactly where the fishing boats are operating. The Pew team gives the information it gathers to port officials to help them decide if they should take action against a ship. Tony Long says he would like to be able to provide port officials all over the world with clear lists. They would inform the officials about ships to inspect, ships to bar from entrance, and ships to permit entrance for trade activities.
The Pacific island nation of Palau was an early user of the technology. Palau has one of the richest fishing areas in the world. Last year, it announced a plan to ban commercial fishing in a 630,000 square kilometer area. K.B. Sakuma is a special adviser to the president of Palau. He says Palau is trying to deal with a recent increase in illegal, unsupervised and unreported fishing.
""And it's come to a head in the last year or two. From our southern island in the evening you can see on the horizon just dotted lights of these illegal fishermen that come into our waters, fill their ships with our fish, our resources, our food security..."" 
 Question:According to the estimation, what is the percentage of illegal fishing? 
A. 1% 
B. 5% 
C. 23.5% 
D. 20% 
 Answer: D
Context: Hotels can make a person's stay away from home as restful as possible. Hotels provide warm beds to allow guests a peaceful night's rest. Besides, some hotels offer guests special services such as newspapers to read in the morning, fresh coffee, and even breakfast. Hotel workers want their guests to feel warm and welcome when they stay in their hotel.
One hotel near the Arctic Circle, however, is different. This hotel gives its guests a cold welcome. The Ice Hotel, in Sweden, is all made of ice. The Ice Hotel might sound strange, but in some ways it is a special hotel. It has a front lobby where guests check into the hotel, plenty of rooms to sleep in, and even room service, which guests can use to have food delivered to their rooms. The Ice Hotel is different, though, because most of the items are made from ice.
It takes more than 30 tons of ice and snow to build the Ice Hotel. It melts  in the summer and is rebuilt each winter. Different builders and artists create the Ice Hotel, so each winter this famous hotel has a new shape and design.
The effort of building the Ice Hotel is worth it, however. Walking into the Ice Hotel is like walking into a diamond. The walls reflect even the smallest bits of light. Ice pillars support the roof. The floor below shines like glass. Almost every inch of this hotel sparkles inside. Visiting the Ice Hotel is truly an unusual experience.
Temperatures inside the Ice Hotel are usually below freezing. Guests wear warm jackets, hats, gloves, and thick boots. Even the owners of the Ice Hotel know that staying in a building with walls of ice four feet thick can be a bit cold. They have a solution though. The Ice Hotel has a sauna for its guests. A sauna is a room filled with steam, where guests can warm themselves. In a way, then, one could say that the Ice Hotel does give their guests a warm welcome after all. 
 Question:Why must the Ice Hotel be rebuilt each year ? 
A. Because the hotel melts during the summer. 
B. Because guests suggest changes to the hotel. 
C. Because the hotel is damaged by the sauna. 
D. Because more rooms are needed at the hotel.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT."" 
 Question:The price of the knives was cut down by half because   _  . 
A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap

Context: Strange Baby-Naming Laws
Germany Parents are banned by law from using last names and the names of objects and products as first names. A child's first name must clearly indicate his or her sex, and all names must be approved by the office of vital statistics in the area in which the child was born.
Iceland The country's naming committee consults the National Register of Persons to determine if a name is acceptable. If parents want to go off-list, they must apply for approval and pay a fee, and the name must contain only letters in the Icelandic alphabet.
New Zealand The country's Births, Deaths, and Marriages Registration Act of 1995 prohibits parents from choosing a name that "" might cause offense to a reasonable person; is unreasonably long; or is, includes, or resembles an official title or rank,"" including, apparently, Adolf Hitler and Yeah Detroit--both names recently rejected.
Denmark If Danish parents prefer a moniker not on the list of 7,000 preapproved baby names, they must get permission from local church and government officials. Fifteen to 20 percent of the 1,100 reviewed names--including creative spellings of common names, last names as first names, and unusual names--are rejected each year. 
 Question:Which name is accepted in New Zealand?

Context: One of the biggest new bands in the UK is Arctic Monkeys.Their first two singles went straight to Number One in the charts and their first album ""Whatever People Say I Am,That's what I'm No"" has become a recordbreaking album.It's the fastest selling debut album in UK chart history.
Arctic Monkeys are famous because of their great success.They achieved their success thanks to the Internet.Usually a new band signs to a record company and then it is through marketing that people buy their singles.The single sales then get the band into the charts and they become popular that way.
However,Arctic Monkeys became wellknown in a slightly different way.Back in 2003 when the band first started,they handed out CDs at their performing concert.Certain fans liked the music so much that they put the music up on the Web.The general public had access to this music because it was on the Internet and,because people liked the music,the band's popularity increased.The band's popularity was starting to get noticed by major radio stations in the UK.
Arctic Monkeys released their first single in October 2005.Before that,their music had only been available to download on the Internet.When they did finally release a single and an album,they both rose to the top of the charts.
Music fans welcome the use of the Internet this way--Arctic Monkeys became popular simply because people liked their music when they heard it.There were no ads.As music downloads continue to increase in popularity,we can expect to see more and more bands make it big in this way. 
 Question:.Before 2005,how can you get Arctic Monkeys' music? 
A. Going to their live music party. 
B. Download their music from the Internet. 
C. Buying their singles and albums in a shop. 
D. Listen to it on the radio in the UK.

Context: (RAMALLAH, West Bank) -- Israel  freed 26 Palestinian  prisoners early Wednesday, the second of four groups to be released as part of an agreement that started the current Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, which had broken down since 2008. In all, 104 prisoners are to be released in four rounds over the coming months.
In the West Bank and Gaza , the mood was overexcited as hundreds of Palestinians welcomed the prisoners back home, after many had spent more than 20 years behind bars.
Crowds of people rushed toward the 5 prisoners released to Gaza, raising them on their shoulders, waving Palestinian flags and dancing to music. Relatives held signs that read ""we will never forget our heroes."" More than 2,000 people welcomed the 21 prisoners released to the West Bank, who were greeted at a ceremony by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah.
Hazem Shubair, thrown into prison in 1994 for the death of an Israeli according to the Israeli Prison Service, was over delighted upon his return to Gaza. ""I am speechless,"" he said. ""Thanks to God. God is greater than the aggressors (meaning Israel)"".
Abbas said a final peace agreement with Israel was possible on the release of the prisoners. ""There will be no final agreement without the release of all the prisoners,"" he told the violent crowd.
Israel's Supreme Court   earlier refused an appeal that intended to cancel the prisoner release. An organization of bereaved   families behind the appeal has said it fears the prisoners, all in connection to the deaths of Israelis, will return to violence once freed. 
 Question:Which of the following is true according to the passage? 
A. Wednesday's release was the whole part of the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. 
B. The other 104 Palestinian prisoners will be freed in the coming months. 
C. All the Palestinian prisoners were greeted by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. 
D. All the Palestinian prisoners were welcomed warmly. 
 Answer: D
Context: Tobacco companies are fighting efforts in the United States and Australia to make their products less appealing. In Washington, a federal judge last week blocked the Food and Drug Administration from requiring new warning labels on cigarette packs. Judge Richard Leon ruled in a case brought by five tobacco companies. The judge temporarily stopped a new federal rule which requires large new warnings starting next September. These include color1 images such as a dead body or diseased lungs. And simple text warnings now appear.
Congress called for color1 images showing the dangers of smoking, similar to what Canada does. But the tobacco companies say the new requirements approved in June violate   their free speech rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Judge Leon said the FDA could not require the new labels before a lawsuit  against the government is decided. Some experts say the process could take years. The judge said he believed the cigarette makers were highly likely to win their case.
He said the images should be designed to appeal to emotions, rejecting government arguments that they should be purely factual. He accused the government of trying to use the labels to promote an ""obvious anti-smoking agenda?""
The head of an anti-smoking group, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the decision ""wrong on the science and wrong on the law"".
About one-fifth of American adults smoke. The World Health Organization says tobacco kills nearly six mil-lion people worldwide each year. More than six hundred thousand of them are non-smokers who breathe other people's tobacco smoke.
In Australia, tobacco companies want to stop what would be the world's most restrictive laws on cigarette advertising. Cigarettes could be sold only in plain olive-green packages. Only the brand name and health warnings could appear. The Senate passed the bill last week and sent it back to the Lower House to approve minor amendments  . The law is to go into effect in December of next year.
Tobacco companies Say the legislation   violates the Australian constitution. They say it would unjustly reduce the value of their brand names and trademarks. Health Minister Nicola Roxon says the government is ready for a legal fight. 
 Question:What are the tobacco companies ii1 the United States and Australia fighting against? 
A. The requirements to sell fewer products to the public. 
B. The requirements to print new warning labels on their products. 
C. The measures to make their products more attractive. 
D. The ways to make the companies close their business.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

Context: The playwright George Bernard Shaw once said humorously, ""England and America are two nations divided by a common language. If he were writing today, he might add 'divided by a common technology--- e-mail'"".
Two completely different styles of e-mail have formed on either side of the Atlantic-Euromail and Amerimail. Americail is informal and chatty. It's likely to begin with a ""Hi"" and end with a ""Bye"". The chances of Amerimail containing a smiley face or an ""xoxo"" are disturbingly high. We Americans are unwilling to dive into the meat of an e-mail. We feel we have to first inform recipients   about our vacation on the island which was really excellent except the jellyfish were biting and the kids caught a cold, so we had to skip the whale watching trip, then about that investors ' meeting in New York. Amerimail is a bundle of contradictions, casual and yet direct, respectful yet over proud. In other words, Amerimail is America.
Euromail is stiff and cold often beginning with a formal ""Dear Mr. X"" and ending with a simple ""Sincerely"". You won't find any mention of kids or the weather or jellyfish in Euromail. It's all business. It's also slow. Your correspondent might take days even weeks to answer a message. Euromail is exactly like the Europeans themselves.
Recently about 100 managers were asked on both sides of the Atlantic whether they noticed differences in e-mail styles. Most said yes. Here are a few of their observations:
""Americans tend to write (e-mail) exactly as they speak.""
""Why don't you just call me instead of writing five e-mails back and forth?""
""Europeans are less interested in checking e-mail"".
""In general, Americans are much more responsive to e-mail--they respond faster and provide more information.""
So which is better, Euromail or Amerimail? I realized it's not popular these days to suggest we have anything to learn from Europeans, but I'm fed up with an inbox filled with casual, barely meaningful e-mails from friends and colleagues. If the alternative is a few earnestly written, carefully worded bits of Euromail, then I say, ""Bring it on."" 
 Question:We can conclude from the passage that   _  . 
A. the different e-mail styles do much harm to the relationship between the two sides on Atlantic 
B. the writer doesn't like either e-mail style as both have their own shortcomings 
C. Euromail always impresses the writer as something more pleasant to read 
D. Amerimail is more appreciated by the writer for being informative and casually written

Context: The Colonel asks Ashenden a good many questions and then suggested that he had particular qualifications for the Secret Service. Ashenden knew several European languages and the fact that he was a writer provided excellent cover: on the pretext that he was writing a book he could, without attracting attention, visit any neutral country.
   It was while they were discussing this point that the Colonel said, ""You know you might get material that would be very useful to you in your work. I'll tell you an incident that occurred only recently. Very dramatic. A foreign government minister went down to a Mediterranean resort to recover from a cold and he had some very important documents with him that he kept in a dispatch case . A day or two after he arrived, he picked up a beautiful blonde at some restaurant or other, and he got very friendly with her. He took her back to his hotel, and when he came to himself in the morning, the lady and the dispatch-case had disappeared. They had one or two drinks up in his room and his theory is that when his back was turned the woman slipped a drug in his glass.
   ""Do you mean to say that happened the other day?"" said Ashenden.
   ""The week before last.""
   ""Impossible,"" cried Ashenden. ""Why! We've been putting that incident on the stage for sixty years, we've written it in a thousand novels. Do you mean to say that life has only just caught up with us?""
   ""Well, I can guarantee the truth of the story."" said the Colonel, ""And believe me, the government has been put to no end of trouble by the loss of the documents.""
   ""Well sir, if you can't do better than that in the Secret Service,"" sighed Ashenden, "" I'm afraid that as a source of inspiration to the writer of fiction, it's washout."" 
 Question:Ashenden cried 'Impossible' after hearing the Colonel's story because he thought   _   . 
A. it could not possibly happen 
B. it was too embarrassing 
C. it was too close to fiction

Context: A weather map is an important tool for geographers. A succession of three or four maps presents a continuous picture of weather changes. Weather forecasters are able to determine the speed of air masses and fronts to determine whether an individual pressure area is deepening or becoming shallow and whether a front is increasing or decreasing in intensity. They are also able to determine whether an air mass is retaining its original characteristics or taking on those of the surface over which it is moving. Thus, a most significant function of the map is to reveal a synoptic picture of conditions in the atmosphere at a given time.
All students of geography should be able to interpret a weather map accurately. Weather maps contain an enormous amount of information about weather conditions existing at the time of observation over a large geographical area. They reveal in a few minutes what otherwise would take hours to describe. The United States Weather Bureau issues information about approaching storms, floods, frosts, droughts, and all climatic conditions in general. Twice a month it issues a 30-day ""outlook"" which is a rough guide to weather conditions likely to occur over broad areas of the United States. These 30-day outlooks are based upon an analysis of the upper air levels which often set the stage for the development of air masses, fronts, and storms.
Considerable effort is being exerted today to achieve more accurate weather predictions. With the use of electronic instruments and earth satellites, enormous gains have taken place recently in identifying and tracking storms over regions which have but few meteorological stations  . Extensive experiments are also in progress for weather modification studies. But the limitations of modification have prevented meteorological results except in the seeding of super-cooled, upslope mountainous winds which have produced additional orographic   precipitation on the windward side of mountain ranges. Nevertheless, they have provided a clearer understanding of the fundamentals of weather elements. 
 Question:A thirty-day forecast is determined by examining   _  . 
A. daily weather maps 
B. upper air levels 
C. satellite reports 
D. changing fronts 
 Answer: B
Context: Right now in China, talks on the street have been about the strange weather and it's raising a lot of concerns. A heavy haze  has blanketed many cities in the northern and southern parts of the country in part of an unusual weather system that's descended on the nation.
The haze stretches over a vast area, from Hebei and Shan-dong Provinces in the north all the way to Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hunan and Fujian provinces in the south. At its worst, the smog is reducing visibility to less than 200 meters and disrupting traffic, both on the ground and in the air. The weather front has also led many to worry about the possible health impacts.
Many cities are waking up to another day covered by a dense haze. In Beijing, drivers have to keep their lights on even though it's already past eight o'clock in the morning. Even driving at very slow speeds, the roads can still be very dangerous. In some of the worst hit areas, drivers can't even tell the colors of traffic signals. Authorities have stepped in to close off many highways across the troubled region. In Shandong Province, the highways that are open are backed up for miles. And traffic police have stepped up their patrols.
In the region's airports, flights information boards have gone red. A huge number of flights have been delayed or cancelled, nearly three hundred in Beijing alone, leaving thousands of passengers stranded. Some are more frustrated than impatient. Passenger from Jinan airport, Shangdong province, said: ""I've been waiting for more than five hours. It's Mother Nature, so there's really nothing we can do."" The airport is urging passengers to confirm with their carrier whether their flight will still take off as scheduled.
Back on the city streets, people are wearing breathing masks to get free from any ill effects. Fog has cleared a little in Shanghai. But damage has already been done. Shanghai resident said: ""I've been wearing the mask, but still, my throat feels sour and itchy. I think it's because of the weather.""
The weather forecast predicts a cold front is about to sweep across central and eastern China tomorrow. Many are hoping that this will clear away the depressive haze as well as the harm it brings. 
 Question:When the passenger said ""It is Mother Nature"", he had a feeling of  _  . 
A. impatience 
B. frustration 
C. Anxiety 
D. curiosity 
 Answer: B
Context: A dense wave of smog began in the Chinese city of Harbin and the surrounding Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning Provinces on 20 October 2013. Unseasonably warm temperatures with very little wind across northeastern China coincided with the smoke from local farmers' burning straws and the start-up of Harbin's coal-powered central heating system.
Record densities of fine particulates were measured in the city. In Harbin, the levels of PM2.5 (particulate matter) rise to 1,000 micrograms per cubic meter, worse than Beijing's historic highs. Visibility was reduced to below 50m in parts of Harbin, and below 500m in most of the neighbouring Jilin Province. On Fa Yuen Street in Harbin, visibility of less than 5m was reported. The smog reduced after October 23, 2013 and completely broke up on October 28, 2013 by the first local snow and icy rain due to a cold front moving in from Russia.
Harbin lies in the north of China where winter temperatures can drop to -40degC, demanding a six-month heating season. Daily particulate levels of more than 40 times the World Health Organization recommended maximum level were reported in parts of Harbin. The smog remained till 23 October, when almost all monitoring stations in Heilongjiang, Jilin,and Liaoning Provincesreported readings above 200mg/m3forPM2.5. PM2.5 is the amount of particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter in the air, with the WHO recommending a maximum 24-hour mean   of 25 micrograms per cubic meter (mg/m3). On the morning of 25 October, PM2.5 measurements in Harbin had fallen to an average of 123mg/m3.
All highways in the surrounding Heilongjiang Province were closed. In Harbin, all primary and middle schools were closed for three days and authorities stopped flights at the airports. Hospitals reported a 23 percent increase in admissions for breathing problems. However, this smog will have no influence on Harbin Ice Festival events later in December 2013.
Air pollution in Chinese cities is of increasing concern to China's leadership. Particulates in the air can affect human health and also have influences on climate and rainfall. Pollution from the burning of coal has reduced life expectancy by 5.5 years in the north of China, as a result of heart and lung diseases. 
 Question:One serious influence of the heavy smog was that  _  . 
A. Harbin Ice Festival would be cancelled 
B. highways in Heilongjiang were free of charge 
C. all flights at the airport were cancelled 
D. doctors in hospitals were kept from working

Context: The passengers on the subway who caught a glimpse of me may have thought I was strange. In particular a gentleman sitting opposite me was always staring at me, looking at the cheese bread on the floor in front of me and then staring back at me. A passenger probably dropped it by mistake and got off at a previous stop, but the gentleman might not think so. ""Next stop, St. Patrick Station"" -- my stop was quickly coming up. I had few minutes to either take the cheese bread, which nobody else was claiming, or left it there.
In those few minutes I felt my pride getting in the way. ""What would others on the subway think of me if I took the cheese bread? Would they think that I was poor and hungry? Would they think that I was stealing?"" The ignorant thing to do was say ""yes"" to any of those _ questions. Actually, they were just my own thoughts. Though I would leave the subway, walk a block to my office, get settled at my desk, and sit comfortably in my office for the whole day, I couldn't get rid of the enormous sense of guilt and regret.
My thoughts once pushed me towards pride and ignorance, but finally I had to admit I was wrong. This missing cheese bread could be a gift for a homeless person who suffered from cold and hunger. So why not overcome a little bit of my pride and pass along so much kindness?
Just as the doors opened at my stop, I grabbed the cheese bread and left the subway. It felt awesome, but I didn't care if people were looking at me or what they were thinking. Instead of going directly to my office as usual, I walked a few more blocks up to Queen's park, where I often saw a homeless man sitting outside. I always wanted to give him something, but only today I walked toward him, who wrapped himself in a sleeping bag. I was full of satisfaction, and so did the homeless man, I thought. 
 Question:Why did the author grab the cheese bread when he got off? 
A. He noticed that no one was looking at him. 
B. He didn't want to see the cheese bread to go to taste. 
C. He valued kindness more than his own pride. 
D. He remembered a homeless man at that very moment.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

Context: Eighth-grader Victoria Bills is talking about money with her classmates. She is worried that a company's stock   price could fall. It may be an unusual topic of conversation for a 13-year-old. But at Bills' school in Chicago, US, you hear it all the time.
The Chicago school's 420 students learn about economic . They also get a chance to make money. Each 1stgrade and 5thgrade, students learn the basics of economics and investing .
Then in 6thgrade, they put what they've learned to work. Students join a junior group that manages the $20,000. The group, made up of 12 to 14 students, decides which stocks to buy.
After graduating, students pass on $20,000 to the next 1stgrade class. They keep half of the rest of the money; the other half goes toward improving the school. They can choose to put their money in a college-savings program or take the cash.
In 2007, Bills suggested that her class buy the stock of the Apple computer company. This was just before the iPhone came out. ""We bought stock just at the right time,"" she says. The kids bought Google stock as it reached $400 a share. It is now worth over $500. ""It was a good buy,"" says Myles Gate, 13. He hopes to be a banker one day.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT."" 
 Question:The price of the knives was cut down by half because   _  . 
A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap 
D. the knives were produced in one factory 
 Answer: B
Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: If your child has mobile internet access, it will be more difficult to monitor  and control his or her internet use. Kids are turning to the internet for everything from hanging out with friends to shopping, which makes it harder for parents to keep track of their online activities. Fortunately, there are many choices for controlling what your kids see on their computers, laptops, and mobile devices.
Content blockers and filters are great tools to use for younger kids. They allow you more control over where they go and what they do online. A content blocker can block some unhealthy websites or limit a child's search to the kind of sites. A content filter can scan sites and pictures and block those sites that contain certain words, key phrases, or content.
Consider tracking software for older teenagers. This software enables you to see which sites your children have visited, tracking their path online. This tool gives young people more freedom to explore the Internet, but it also allows you to check that they are using the internet responsibly. Let your teenagers know that you trust them, but that you will be regularly checking that they are visiting appropriate sites online.
Even if you use content blockers, filters, and trackers, you know that a lot of kids figure out ways to get around these, so it's important to remain alert . Remember that not all adult sites can be identified by blocker, filter, or tracker software. That's why it's important to talk to your kids about what to do when something inappropriate or scary comes up. Nothing can replace involvement and supervision  by adults. Keep monitoring how your kids use the internet on a regular basis without getting into the role of internet traffic police. 
 Question:What is the passage mainly about? 
A. More and more kids have mobile internet access 
B. Some choices for monitoring and controlling kid's internet use 
C. It is difficult to monitor and control kid's internet use 
D. Kids are turning to the internet for everything

Context: Smog is a big problem in many Chinese cities. But it seems that besides wearing a mask, few of us know what has caused the smog and what to do to beat it. Chai Jing, a former news interviewer with CCTV, discussed the questions in her documentary Under the Dome.
The 103-minute film was on websites on Feb 28. In the film, Chai visits polluted places and talks to officials and scientists. She thinks that burning too much coal and oil are the main causes of PM2.5 and smog.
To solve the problem, Chai suggests that we should clean our coal and oil or replace them with cleaner energy such as natural gas.
In her film, Chai also emphasized   that everyone can do something to help control smog too. For example, we can live a greener life by using more public transport. Or if we see things that could harm the environment, we can try to stop it. In the film, when she sees a restaurant cooking without any suitable filter facilities  , she calls the hotline 12369. The restaurant installed the filter a week later.
Chen Jining, the new minister of environmental protection, praised Chai. ""This film encourages ordinary people to take notice of the environment. This is what we need in the future."" 
 Question:Which of the following is NOT included in Chai's suggestions towards reducing smog? 
A. Using cleaner energy. 
B. Cleaning coal and oil. 
C. Using public transport. 
D. Replacing coal with wind energy. 
 Answer: D
Context: Cities could soon be looking after their citizens all by themselves thanks to an operating system(OS) designed for the metropolis.
The Urban OS works just like a PC operating system but keeps buildings 9 traffic and services running smoothly.
The software takes in data from sensors dotted around the city to keep an eye on what is happening.
In the event of a fire the Urban OS might manage traffic lights so fire engines can reach the blaze swiftly.
The idea is for the Urban OS to gather data from sensors buried in buildings and many other places to keep an eye on what is happening in an urban area.
The sensors monitor everything from large scale events such as traffic flows across the entire city down to more local phenomena such as temperature sensors inside individual rooms.
The OS completely bypasses humans to manage communication between sensors and devices such as traffic lights, air conditioning or water pumps that influence the quality of city life.
Channeling all the data coming from these sensors and services into a over-arching control system had lots of benefits, said Steve Lewis, head of Living Plan FT-the company behind Urban OS.The system can help with monitoring patients at hospitals.
Urban OS should mean buildings get managed better and gathering the data from lots of sources gives a broader view of key city services such as traffic flows, energy use and water levels.
"" If you were using an anatomy analogy, the city has a network like the nervous system, talking to a whole bunch of sensors gathering the data and causing actions,"" said Mr.Lewis.
"" We distribute that nervous system into the parts of the body--the buildings, the streets and other things.
Having one platform managing the entire urban landscape of a city means significant cost savings, implementation consistency, quality and manageability, he added.
""And it' s got local computing capacity to allow a building or an automotive platform to interact with people where they are, managing the energy, water, waste, transportation, logistics and human interaction in those areas.""
That' s dealt with by the building itself, with the devices very locally talking to each other to figure out what' s the best solution for the current dilemma.

Context: The most complex object known to humanity is the human brain -- and not only is it complex, but it is one of the few natural phenomena that science has no consciousness of. To try to replicate   something that is so poorly understood may therefore seem like pride. But you have to start somewhere, and International Business Machines (IBM) and the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), in Switzerland, propose to start by replicating ""in silico"", one of the brain's building blocks.
In a partnership announced, the two organizations said they would be working together to build a simulation   of a structure known as a neo-cortical column on a type of IBM supercomputer that is currently used to study the molecular functioning of genes. If that works, they plan to use more powerful computers to link such simulated columns together into something that mimics  a brain.
In a real brain, a neo-cortical column is a cylindrical element about a third of a millimeter in diameter and three millimeters long. It is these columns, arranged side by side like the cells of a honeycomb, which make up the famous ""grey matter"" that has become shorthand for human intelligence. The Blue Gene/L supercomputer that will be used for the simulation consists of enough independent processors for each to be programmed to mimic an individual nerve cell in a column.
The EPFL's contribution to the Blue Brain Project will be to create a digital description of how the columns behave. The database from its Brain Mind Institute will provide the raw material for the simulation. Biologists and computer scientists will then connect the artificial nerve cells up in a way that mimics nature. They will do so by assigning electrical properties to them, and telling them how to communicate with each other and how they should modify their connections with one another depending on their activity.
That will be no mean feat. Even a single nerve cell is complicated, not least because each one has about 10,000 connections with others. And nerve cells come in great variety--relying, for example, on different chemical transmitters to carry messages across those connections. Eventually, however, a digital representation of an entire column Should occur.
Assuming that the growth of computing power continues to follow Moore's Law, the leader of IBM's side thinks it should be practical to mimic an entire human brain in silico this way in ten to fifteen years. Such an artificial brain would, of course, be a powerful research tool. It would allow neurological experiments that currently take days in a ""web lab"" to be conducted in seconds. The researchers hope that their simulated brain will reveal the secrets of how certain psychiatric and neurological, disorders develop. But that is probably not the real reason for doing it. The most interesting question, surely, is whether such an artificial brain will be intelligent, or conscious, or both.

Context: Making a film takes a long time and is very hard work. Writing the story for the film may take many weeks. Shooting   the film often takes at least six months. Actors and camera men work from very early in the morning until late at night. Each scene has to be acted and re-acted, filmed and re-filmed, until it is just fine. Sometimes the same scene has to be acted many times.
The film studio is like a large factory, and the indoor stages are very big indeed. Scenery of all kinds is made in the studio. Churches, houses, and forests are all built of wood and cardboard. Several hundred people work together to make one film. Some of these people are the actors and actresses. The director of the film, however, is the most important person in a film studio. He decides how the scenes should be filmed and how the actors should act.
Most people go to see a film because they know the film stars are in it. Sometimes the film may be very poor. It is best to choose a film made by a good director. Some famous directors make their films very real; people feel that they themselves are among the people in the films.

A. Writing the Story 
B. Actors and Actresses 
C. A Director 
D. Making a Film

Context: Douglas Florian teaches readers about bees in a new book of poems called UnBEElievables. In his latest book, each poem is paired with a colorful image that illustrates  a different type of bee and its role in the group. Every page is full of fun and interesting facts about these social insects.
TFK: When you brainstorm for a story, which comes first: the images or the poems?
FLORIAN: Usually the poems come first. For a book of 21 poems, for example, I'll actually write about 50 poems first. Although I sometimes have images in my mind to go along with the words, I have to choose which ones I want to include in the book.
TFK: Many of your books, including UnBEElievables, are about insects and animals. How did these become your favorite subjects?
FLORIAN: There is so much humor in the animal world. People have a lot of knowledge about animals and ideas about animals that are fun to explore in writing. Animals are just so interesting. When I research, I find out so many new and amazing facts. The poem is often half written by the time I have done with my research.
TFK: Why did you choose bees as the subject of your latest book?
FLORIAN: I saw recently in the news that many bees are dying out. Scientists believe this to be caused by various diseases. I wanted to create awareness and learn more about bees after hearing this. So many of the fruits and vegetables we eat are dependent on pollination  by honeybees. If bees disappear, so will much of our food.
TFK: Do you have a favorite bee?
FLORIAN: One of my favorites is the poem and painting about the worker bees. I wanted the painting to be very playful and light. These bees have to work all day, and it's kind of like a factory. And even though these bees have to work very hard, they manage to smile. 
 Question:UnBEElievables is a book about  _  . 
A. insects 
B. images 
C. stories 
D. fruits

Context: John McCain and Barack Obama call for closer U.S.-Chinese cooperation on trade, the environment and nuclear proliferation  in the upcoming issue of an American business group's magazine. They do so in an unusual effort to  _ voters abroad.
Both articles appeared Sunday on the website of the American Chamber of Commerce  in China, and will be published in China Brief, the chamber's monthly magazine, on September 22.
Both stress that the countries should work more closely to ease trade friction , fight global warming, improve military exchanges, and block the spread of nuclear weapons to such countries as Iran and North Korea. 
""Cooperation on the key, enduring global challenges, such as climate change, can deepen understanding and enhance confidence. """"We also need to deepen high-level dialogues on a sustained basis on economic, security and global political issues"", said Obama in the article.
McCain agreed that the cooperation with prefix = st1 /Chinawould be essential in addressing issues of global concern. ""TheUnited Statesshares common interests withChinathat can form the basis of a strong partnership on issues of global concern, including climate change, trade and proliferation,"" he added. ""and I hope to see our relationship develop in a manner that benefits both countries and, in turn, the Asia-Pacific region and the world,"" he noted.
Both candidates  were impressed by China's economic success.
""Chinahas achieved extraordinary, sustained growth over the past three decades. Hundreds of millions of people inChinalive better now than most thought possible even two decades ago,"" Obama said.
""China's double-digit growth rates have brought hundreds of millions out of poverty, energized the economies of its neighbors and produced many new economic opportunities,"" McCain said.
Gao Wenhuan, 21st Century Online's special reporter, interviewed Marshall M. Bouton, president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. ""My guess is, regardless of who is elected in November, you will hear basically the same description that Chinais a strategic partner and competitor,"" said Bouton.
A survey conducted by the Council in July 2008 found that the majority of respondents clearly admired China's accomplishments, but some Americans viewedChina's rising global power as a threat. According to the survey,Chinanow is seen as the most influential country in the world following theU.S..

Context: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth.
An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, ""the worst came to the worst"". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door.
The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced.
Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank. He says the plant seeds would only be used when all other seeds are gone for some reason. Norwayfirst proposed the idea in the 1980s. But security concerns delayed the plan. At that time, the Soviet Union was meeting inRomeof the Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the above passage? 
A. The government of Norwaywill perform the project alone. 
B. Seeds to be collected there were produced ten thousands years ago. 
C. Spitsbergen is chosen because it is free of the threat unclear war forever. 
D. Temperature is a major consideration when choosing the storage place. 
 Answer: D
Context: In the deep blue Indian Ocean, there's a beautiful island   country called Maldives . It's the smallest in population and area of all the Asian countries. It has an area of 90,000 km2, but 99% of the area is covered by the sea. It has 1,190 islands and is about 820 km from North to South. People live on no more than 200 islands, while another 87 are visited by tourists. _ The capital Maleis is on one of the middle islands, and about 75,000 people live there.

Context: The Norwegian Government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down (though these have already been raised); and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the Government will be able to hold things back for long. As one Norwegian politician said last week: "" We will soon be changed beyond all recognition.""
Ever since the war, the Government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. During the past few years this program has had a great deal of success. Tromso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern policy could be in ruins.
The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 percent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad.
The real argument over oil is its threat to the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it, because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as essentially Norwegian. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most critical of the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the countryside and to the sea. 
 Question:According to the passage, the oil industry might lead northern Norway to   _  . 
A. the development of industry 
B. a growth in population 
C. the failure of the development program 
D. the development of new towns

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.

Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

 Answer: C
Context: Walking across the campus of Pittsburgh's prefix = st1 /CarnegieMellonUniversityone delightful spring day, I came upon a table filled with young people chatting and enjoying the fine weather. Several had identical blue T-shirts with ""Trilogy @ CMU"" written across them--Trilogy being an Austin, Texasbased software company with a reputation of recruiting  our top students. I walked over to the table. ""Are you guys here to recruit?"" I asked. ""No,  ly not,"" they replied firmly. ""We're not recruiters. We're just hanging out, playing a little frisbee with our friends."" How interesting, I thought. They've come to campus on a workday, all the way from Austin, just to hang out with some new friends.
   As I later learned, they were gifted students who had inked the highest-paying deal in the history of their departments.
   I asked one young man why he was going to a smaller city in Taxas. The company is excellent, he told me. There are also terrific people and the work is challenging. Though he had several good job offers fromPittsburgh's high-tech firms and knew the city well, he said he felt the city lacked the life-styles options, cultural diversity, and tolerant attitude that would make it attractive to him. As he summed it up: ""How would I fit in here?""
  What a change from my own college days, just a little more than 20 years ago, when students would put on their dressiest clothes and carefully hide any counterculture tendencies to prove that they could fit in with the company. Today, apparently, it's the company trying to fit in with the students.
  These young men and their lifestyles represent a lively new force in the enonomy and life ofAmerica. They are members of what I call the creative class: a fast-growing, highly educated, and well-paid part of the workforce on whose efforts corporate profits and economic growth increasingly depend. They do not consciously think of themselves as a class. Yet they share a common belief that values creativity, individuality, difference, and advantage. 
 Question:What can you infer from the passage? 
A. The young people prefer to work in a small quiet city. 
B. The high pay is the main attraction to the young people. 
C. Pittsburgh has many advantages overAustin. 
D. Pittsburghdoesn't have enough attractions to the young people.

Context: A U.S. dad quit his job, giving up a massive salary, after his 10-year-old daughter gave him a 22-point list outlining all the events he missed so far during the year. As the CEO of the $2 trillion global investment fund PIMCO, Mohamed El-Erian shocked the finance industry when he quit in January.
El-Erian said it was about a year ago when he was repeatedly asking his daughter to brush her teeth, but she wasn't listening. When he asked her why, she responded with a list of 22 milestones he had missed: like the first day of school and the first soccer game of the season.
""And the school year wasn't yet over,"" El-Erian wrote. ""I felt awful and got defensive: I had a good excuse for each missed event! Travel, important meetings, and urgent phone call, sudden to-dos. But it dawned on me that I was missing an infinitely more important point. My work-life balance had gotten out of whack, and the imbalance was hurting my very special relationship with my daughter. I was not making enough time for her."" El-Erian explained he was struggling with the same thing so many parents do--work-life balance.
Dads who are quitting their profit-making jobs to improve work-life balance is a subject that is getting more traction as some high-profile executive have recently written about their experiences.
Last month, former MongoDB CEO Max Schireson wrote a blog post for Time about his decision to step down from the company's top job. He wrote that he struggled to make time for his three children because he was flying around half a million kilometres a year for work.
""I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car, or when my son had an emergency surgery,"" Schireson wrote.
On an overnight flight to Texas he woke up in Arizona to discover the plane made an emergency landing and some traumatized crew members had to be replaced. He decided it was time to address his work-life balance.
Quitting is something El-Erian and Schireson were financially able to do, but El-Erian recognizes most people don't have this luxury. He hopes companies will pay attention to improving work-life balance for their employees.
El-Erian now manages ""a portfolio of part-time jobs"" that don't require as much travel. He alternates mornings with his wife taking their daughter to school and he often picks her up from school.
""So far, it's been the right decision for me,"" he wrote. ""I'm so grateful that this is providing me greater opportunity to experience key moments in my daughter's life before they're all too quickly gone."" 
 Question:El-Erian resigned from PIMCO mainly because   _  . 
A. his daughter has been missing him badly 
B. he was getting bored with the endless flights 
C. he hoped to get his daughter to listen to her 
D. he wanted to experience his daughter's milestones

Context: My summer hols wr CWOT. B4, we usd 2 go 2 NY 2C my bro, his CF & thr 3:-@ kids FTF ILNY, its gr8.
Can you understand this sentence? If you can't, don't feel too bad: neither could the middle school teacher in England who received this as homework. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cellphones. To newcomers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the ""translation"" of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York; it's great.
Schoolteachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes cxan be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted .
Everyone should just relax, say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nunberg, from Stanford University, agrees. ""People get better at writing by writing,"" he says, ""Kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mail, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than, their parents.""
Linguist James Millroy says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can bet your bottom dollar that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents, they too will think this way. Milroy argues that languages do not and cannot become ""corrupted""; they simply change to meet the new needs.
However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write Standard English. Cynthia McVey says, ""I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but that learning to write proper English is a must for their future.""
Perhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway. Erin, age 12, says, ""I wouldn't use text language in my homework. Texting is just for fun"" 
 Question:Which of the following is true according to the passage? 
A. Cynthia McVey points out teenagers can deal with Netspeak properly. 
B. Geoffrey Nunberg believes Netspeakers can write Standard English. 
C. David Crystal thinks Netspeak helps develop the habit of writing. 
D. James Milroy says that language is changing and improving.

Context: The Colonel asks Ashenden a good many questions and then suggested that he had particular qualifications for the Secret Service. Ashenden knew several European languages and the fact that he was a writer provided excellent cover: on the pretext that he was writing a book he could, without attracting attention, visit any neutral country.
   It was while they were discussing this point that the Colonel said, ""You know you might get material that would be very useful to you in your work. I'll tell you an incident that occurred only recently. Very dramatic. A foreign government minister went down to a Mediterranean resort to recover from a cold and he had some very important documents with him that he kept in a dispatch case . A day or two after he arrived, he picked up a beautiful blonde at some restaurant or other, and he got very friendly with her. He took her back to his hotel, and when he came to himself in the morning, the lady and the dispatch-case had disappeared. They had one or two drinks up in his room and his theory is that when his back was turned the woman slipped a drug in his glass.
   ""Do you mean to say that happened the other day?"" said Ashenden.
   ""The week before last.""
   ""Impossible,"" cried Ashenden. ""Why! We've been putting that incident on the stage for sixty years, we've written it in a thousand novels. Do you mean to say that life has only just caught up with us?""
   ""Well, I can guarantee the truth of the story."" said the Colonel, ""And believe me, the government has been put to no end of trouble by the loss of the documents.""
   ""Well sir, if you can't do better than that in the Secret Service,"" sighed Ashenden, "" I'm afraid that as a source of inspiration to the writer of fiction, it's washout."" 
 Question:Ashenden cried 'Impossible' after hearing the Colonel's story because he thought   _   . 
A. it could not possibly happen 
B. it was too embarrassing 
C. it was too close to fiction 
D. it was too recent

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT.""

Context: Like a growing number of young women in Vietnam's northern part city of Haiphong, Pham Thi Hue was infected with HIV by her husband, one of the town's many drug users. But instead of being shamed into silence, as Vietnamese with HIV and AIDS are, the 25-year-old tailor and mother of one went public, appearing on television and at conferences. Her business suffered and her neighbors insulted  her, but Hue has now become the public face of Mothers and Wives, an HIV/ AIDS support group established in Haiphong by a Norwegian nongovernmental organization and her neighborhood's People's Committee. Last year, she founded a smaller group named after a local flower. People who need advice on treatment or help preparing bodies for burial can dial a hot line and get assistance from able and sympathetic HIV victims. ""We gather to support each other,"" Hue says. ""When we are sick, what we need most is encouragement and comfort from people who understand our situation and are willing to share our happiness, as well as our sadness.""
On a hot and damp night last month, Hue welcomed into her small home a very thin woman, also a tailor, who was HIV positive. The woman tearfully told Hue that she had not told anyone about her condition, fearing that she would lose customers and that her daughter would be insulted at school. Hue became the wise elder, offering medical and personal advice. 
 Question:From the passage we can learn that Pham Thi Hue is a woman who is  _  .

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information.

But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss.

Context: John works in a market. It's near a secondary school. Every day, students come to buy things there. In the morning , John gets up at six and then has breakfast. He goes to work by bike. He gets to the shop at about six thirty. The market opens at seven. They sell things like food and drinks. They have school things, too.

Context: The health-care economy is filled with unusual and even unique economic relationships. One of the least understood involves the peculiar roles of producer or ""provider"" and purchaser or ""consumer"" in the typical doctor-patient relationship. In most sectors of the economy, it is the seller who attempts to attract a potential buyer with various appealing factors of price, quality, and use, and it is the buyer who makes the decision. Such condition, however, is not common in most of the health-care industry.
In the health-care industry, the doctor-patient relationship is the mirror image of the ordinary relationship between producer and consumer. Once an individual has chosen to see a physician -- and even then there may be no real choice -- it is the physician who usually makes all significant purchasing decisions: whether the patient should return ""next Wednesday"", whether X-rays are needed, whether drugs should be prescribed, etc. It is rare that a patient will challenge such professional decisions or raise in advance questions about price, especially when the disease is regarded as serious.
This is particularly significant in relation to hospital care. The physician must certify the need for hospitalization, determine what procedures will be performed, and announce when the patient may be discharged. The patient may be consulted about some of the decisions, but in general it is the doctor's judgments that are final. Little wonder then that in the eye of the hospital it is the physician who is the real ""consumer"". As a consequence, the medical staff represents the ""power center"" in hospital policy and decision-making, not the administration.
Although usually there are in this situation four identifiable participants-- the physician, the hospital, the patient, and the payer (generally an insurance carrier or government)-- the physician makes the essential decisions for all of them. The hospital becomes an extension of the physician; the payer generally meets most of the bills generated by the physician/hospital, and for the most part the patient plays a passive role. We estimate that about 75-80 percent of health-care choices are determined by physicians, not patients. For this reason, the economy directed at patients or the general is relatively ineffective. 
 Question:The author's primary purpose in writing this passage is to   _  . 
A. urge hospitals to reclaim their decision-making authority 
B. inform potential patients of their health-care rights 
C. criticize doctors for exercising too much control over patients 
D. analyze some important economic factors in health-care 
 Answer: D
Context: Tourists were surprised to see a woman driving a huge orange tractor down one of Rome's main avenues. Italy's political leaders are said to have been even more puzzled to see that the tractor was followed by about 200,000 women in a parading procession that took more than three hours  _ . Shouting slogans, waving flags and dancing to drumbeats, the women had come to the capital from all over Italy to demonstrate for 'a job for each of us, a different type of job'.
     Women, who make up 52 % of Italy's population, today represent only 35% of Italy's total workforce and 33% of the total number of Italian with jobs. However, their presence in the workplace is increasing. The employment of women is expanding considerably in services, next to the public administration and commerce as their principle workplace. Official statistics also show that women have also made significant progress in self-employment. More and more women are going into business for themselves. Many young women are turning to business. It is also a fact that today many prejudices have disappeared, so that banks and other financial institutes make judgments on purely business considerations without caring if it is a man or woman. Such changes are occurring in other professions too. The number of women doctors, dentists, lawyers, engineers and university professors has increased. Some of the changes are immediately visible. For example, women have appeared on the scene for the first time as state police, railway workers and street cleaners.
   However, the present situation is far from satisfactory though some progress has been made. A breakthrough in equal opportunities for women is now demanded. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage ? 
A. There are more women than men in Italy. 
B. In Italy women are completely employed in services. 
C. In Italy women are still at a disadvantage in employment. 
D. In Italy about two-thirds of the jobs are held by men.

Context: At home, ordering food from a menu is a normal, everyday routine. I don't even give it a second thought. In China, it's a whole other story! Here, ordering is a fun game of trial and error, and the adventure begins before the food is even served!
Many restaurants in central Beijing advertise ""English language menus"", but the translations can just add to the confusion. Although accompanying pictures can be a helpful relief, the translations often make the whole experience even more amusing. During my first few weeks in China I tried some delicious dishes with strange names. As an experiment, my friends and I would order things like ""students addicted to chicken gristle  "" and ""red burned lion head"". It was always fun to see what landed on our table. Eventually we learned that ""lion head"" was actually pork, and ""students"" are ""addicted"" to diced   chicken with green pepper.
Recently, I came across a busy restaurant down a narrow side street in a Beijing hutong. It was lunchtime and the small room was packed with people sitting on small stools   eating noodles. I was hungry and cold, and the steaming bowls looked irresistible! I sat myself down and called out for a ""caidan!"" In response, the waitress pointed to a wall at the back of the restaurant. The wall was full of Chinese characters describing numerous dishes. There was only one sentence in English: ""crossing over the bridge noodles"".
I had never heard of the dish and had no idea what it would taste like. I took a gamble and ordered one bowl of ""crossing over the bridge noodles"". A few minutes later the waitress carried over a heavy bowl full of broth   and I quickly dug in. It was the best bowl of noodles I had ever tasted! I have been back again and again and each time I point at the one English sentence - ""crossing over the bridge noodles"". I always enter a restaurant in China feeling excited and a little nervous. Who knows what the next ordering adventure will reveal? 
 Question:The passage mainly deals with   _  . 
A. the author's favorite Chinese dishes 
B. the fun the author had ordering food in China's restaurant 
C. a comparison between Western food and Chinese food 
D. the correct way to translate the names of Chinese dishes into English

Context: In its latest step to attract Chinese smartphone users, e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. said it is planning to launch a mobile gaming service soon. 
Alibaba is considering integrating  its new mobile gaming service into its messaging app, Laiwang, as well as its Mobile Taobao app for online shopping, a person familiar with the matter said. It is also planning to launch the gaming service as a standalone app, the person said. 
In the world of gaming and other mobile-based services, Alibaba faces powerful competitor Tencent Holdings Ltd., a giant in online gaming and social networking services. Many analysts view Tencent as a leader in mobile-based businesses in China because of its popular WeChat instant-messaging app, which has over 272 million monthly active users worldwide according to the company. Tencent could use WeChat's massive user base to offer additional mobile services such as gaming or e-commerce, analysts say. 
Alibaba's push into mobile-based services hasn't always been smooth. It launched Laiwang more than a year ago, but the app, which competes against WeChat, struggled to gain popularity. In September, a person familiar with the situation said Alibaba was in talks with China Telecom Corp., to have the app preinstalled in smartphones sold by the country's third-largest mobile carrier. According to Alibaba, Laiwang had more than 10 million registered users as of November. 
Alibaba dominates China's e-commerce market with its Taobao and Tmall shopping sites, but one of the biggest challenges it faces is how to hold onto its vast user base when more Chinese Internet users access online services from smartphones. To meet this challenge, Alibaba has made several acquisitions to strengthen its mobile-based services. Last year, it took an 18% stake  in Sina Corp.'s Twitter-like Weibo service and integrated some of Taobao's e-commerce services with the microblog. It also bought a 28% stake in mobile mapping firm AutoNavi Holdings Ltd., a move that could enable Alibaba to send location-based ads to smartphone users.

Context: The World Bank estimates there are about 650 million mobile phone users in African countries south of the Sahara Desert. That is greater than the number of users in the United States and European Union.
Samia Melhem worke for the World Bank to increase information technologies in Africa. She says mobile phones are the fastest growing technology on the continent.
""Faster than TV, definitely faster than electricity. More people have access to mobile phones and therefore communication. More people have internet access today in Africa than they have access to water, clean water, or even sanitation .So we can say that this has been the most significant revolution in terms of changing the African landscape and how people live their daily life.""
CNN television recently named seven ways of life it says have been revolutionized because of mobile phones. They include political activism, education, entertainment, disaster management, agriculture and health.
Another area is banking. Reports say half of more of the adults in Gabon, Kenya and Sudan use mobile money. Rene Mendy sells goods in the streets of Dakar, Senegal. But he never had enough money to open a bank account.
Now he uses a mobile phone banking service called Orange Money. With his telephone, he can add or take out as little as one dollar. He can make payments and send money to family members who live far away.
Orange Money says it serves four million customers in ten countries. The World Bank's Samia Melham notes that the French company is facing competition from other mobile banking services.
""The mobile banking is a huge trend. And people in the West don't understand it, because most people have bank accounts and they have credit cards. It-mobile banking-is the instant possession fo cash at a much lower cost. The cost is the cost of sending an SMS, which is almost nothing compared to what traditional transfer agents, like Western Union, would charge-10 dollars or more for a particular money transfer.""

A. seven ways of life revolutionized because of mobile phones 
B. more people having access to clean water 
C. mobile phones being the fastest growing technology in Africa 
D. the fast development of electricity in Africa

Context: According to the Small Business Association, more than 50 percent of all small businesses fail within the first five years. This is not the case for Apiary Fund CEO, Shawn Lucas. Shawn has grown a very successful business focusing on teaching people how to trade foreign currencies. The Apiary Fund not only gives their traders some of the best Forex   education possible but also gives their traders money to trade with. The Apiary Fund had a slow start but has now become a company that recently hit $1 billion in trader volume  . The Apiary Fund's success has come from the great business concept, and work ethic  .
* Business Concept
The Apiary Fund has a very special but effective business concept, which Shawn Lucas discovered many years ago. You are probably wondering, where did this business concept come from? Shawn, while working as a Financial Advisor, received a phone call one day from a man he hadn't ever spoken to before. The man asked Shawn to go with him to China to do an analysis of a Chinese company's trading systems. The company at the time was under investigation for a possible violation   of intellectual property rights. He agreed to go and before he knew it he was on a plane to China.
During the analysis of this Chinese company Shawn noticed the company had a very effective business method. He noticed that the risk manager had created a system that protected the company from rarely posting a losing day. The risk manager made this all possible by putting restrictions on the amount a trader could lose. If one of the traders lost even a small amount the risk manager would then be notified  .
Shawn left China with a business concept that would later consume much of his life. After returning home, Shawn was devoted to creating a similar risk management system as the Chinese company had created. That risk management system turned into a successful business called the Apiary Fund.
* Work Ethic
The business concept alone didn't magically make the Apiary Fund into a booming business. The Apiary Fund became successful from hard work and devotion. This hard work and devotion has recently brought the Apiary Fund to hit a trading volume high of $1 billion. Shawn Lucas believes that by the end of this year the Apiary Fund can expect to see double or triple that volume. The company has experienced immense growth by making a few changes to their program structure, which has since increased growth by about five times within the last year.
Successful businesses are hard to start, but with a good business concept and great work ethic anything is possible. Shawn and the Apiary Fund are a great example of both. 
 Question:What does Shawn's business do? 
A. Trading with foreigners. 
B. Lend money to those who need it. 
C. Help people to found their own business. 
D. Teach people how to trade foreign currencies.

Context: Is it time to kick Russia out of the BRICs  ? If so, it may end up sounding like a famous ball-point pen maker-BIC. An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device ,the BRICs, should really be the BICs.
""Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?"" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreigh Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of ""The Russian Balance Sheet"", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes:
""The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas. ""
Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing
far better than Russia.
But the BRICs are not just about economy. As is mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while around 80 percent is for the other three.
At very least, however, Russia's economic underperformance and stock market outperfoumance does suggest it is indeed one of the group. 
 Question:According to Aslund, Russia shouldn't be a BRIC partly because  _  . 
A. Russia's economic performance is far worse than the other three 
B. Russia's leaders are not good at managing economy 
C. Russia has taken effective measures to improve its economy 
D. Russia will no longer attract investors from other countries

Context: Shundagarh is a village on India's east-facing coast.It is a village of simple mud and grass houses built on the beach just above the waterline.The Khadra Hills rise immediately behind the village,to a height of one hundred and fifty meters.A simple,good-hearted old man,whose name was Jalpur,farmed two small fields on the very edge of these hills.From his fields he could see the fishing boats that travelled up and down the coast.He could see the children playing on the sands;their mothers washing clothes on the flat stones where the Shiva River flowed into the sea;and their fathers landing the latest catch or repairing nets and telling stories that had no end.
All Jalpur owned in the world were the clothes he wore day in and day out,the miserable hut  that he slept in at night,a few tools and cooking pots--and his fields.The corn that he grew was all that made life possible.If the weather was kind and the harvest was good,Jalpur could live happily enough--not well,but happily.When the sun was fierce,and there was little or no rain,then he came close to the line between life and death.
Last year the weather had been so kind,and the harvest promised to be so good,that Jalpur had been wondering whether he could sell all that he had and live with his son farther up the coast.He had been thinking about doing this for some years.It was his dearest wish to spend his last days with his son and his wife.But he would go only if he could give;he would not go if it meant taking food out of the mouths of his grandchildren.He would rather die hungry than do this.
On the day when Jalpur decided that he would harvest his corn,sell it,and move up the coast,he looked out to sea and saw a huge wave,several kilometers out,advancing on the coast and on the village of Shundagarh.Within ten minutes everyone in Shundagarh would be drowned.Jalpur would have shouted,but the people were too far away to hear.He would have run down the hill,but he was too old to run.He was prepared to do anything to save the people of Shundagarh,so he did the only thing that he could do: he set fire to his corn.In a matter of seconds the flames were rising high and smoke was rising higher.Within a minute the people of Shundagarh were racing up the hill to see what had happened.There,in the middle of his blackened cornfield,they found Jalpur;and there they buried him.
On his grave,they wrote the words: Here lies Jalpur,a man who gave,living: a man who died,giving. 
 Question:Why didn't Jalpur live well? 
A. He didn't work hard. 
B. He had too many children to feed. 
C. He only depended on good weather and harvest for survival. 
D. The villagers kept taking his corn.

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government.

Context: prefix = st1 /China's economic growth 'hard to predict'
The worsening global economic situation makes it difficult for Chinato predict its growth for next year, a senior official said on Friday.
""How fast China's economy will grow next year is uncertain,"" Liu He, deputy director of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Finance and Economy Work, told China Daily.
""To a large  _ , the rate will be decided by the external situation,"" Liu said during a discussion with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and other economists in Beijing.
This year, GDP is estimated to grow at 9.4 or 9.5 percent, down from 10.6 percent last year, he said. However, the impact of the current financial turbulence ""on our economy is much less than on the rest of the world"", he said.
Nicholas Stern, a former UK government advisor, also told China Daily it will take at least one or two years for the world to recover from the recession, which is now spreading from the US and the UK to the rest of the world.
""We don't know how long the recession will last, but it is unlikely to be short,"" he said.
Liu said China can use the downturn as an opportunity to restructure its economy, which has relied heavily on government investment, foreign trade and low-cost technology over the past years.
""When the economy is experiencing fast growth, companies are unwilling to upgrade their technologies,"" Liu said.
""The slowdown gives such firms the opportunity to enhance their competitive edge through better technologies.""

Context: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth.
An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, ""the worst came to the worst"". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door.
The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced.
Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank. He says the plant seeds would only be used when all other seeds are gone for some reason. Norwayfirst proposed the idea in the 1980s. But security concerns delayed the plan. At that time, the Soviet Union was meeting inRomeof the Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the above passage? 
A. The government of Norwaywill perform the project alone. 
B. Seeds to be collected there were produced ten thousands years ago. 
C. Spitsbergen is chosen because it is free of the threat unclear war forever. 
D. Temperature is a major consideration when choosing the storage place.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair.

A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle.

1778,"Definition: Given a reading comprehension type question-answering from an english exam for school students. You are given a context and multiple choice question containing four options ""A."", ""B."", ""C."" and ""D."". The question is answerable from the comprehension. Based on the question, the option and the context select the most appropriate answer from the provided choices ""A."", ""B."", ""C."" and ""D."".
Context: ""Any time! Any where! Decades ago there was no such thing"" - ""Communication"".
Then, September 7th 1987, the global system for mobile communication or GSM was born. And international agreements that laid out the standards, regulations and practices gave rise to a global mobile phone industry.
To be honest, the world's first mobiles were not so attractive and the range of effectiveness wasn't very good. But they became a must-have among those wealthy people who could afford that. However, by advantage of GSM which has many different elements to it, we can all enjoy the ability to go around the world in 217 countries, land in that country and know that a phone would work.
There are other cell phone systems using different technology in the world. The majority of the United States and parts of South America have been using something called CDMA which is very rare in Europe. In some Asian countries like China, GSM and CDMA both exist at the same time. But the GSM Association claims 85% of the global mobile phone market. They estimated there are now about 2.5 billion different users who make more than 7 trillion minutes of calls everyday, and that's not all.
20 years later, the mobile phone is so much more than just a phone. You can use it to send text messages, take pictures, show video, even surf the internet.
""The phone itself is involved from just being a communication tool, to be a tool for round-the-clock connectivity, you can not live without it even in a minute."" Mobile consultant Nick Lane also points out with so many customized styles and features, your mobile phone will become a symbol of you.
Where will the global mobile phone industry be in another 20 years? Certainly, there will be more connections than better coverage. As for where else technology will take us, one can only imagine. 
 Question:From this passage, we can infer that   _  . 
A. as soon as the first mobiles appeared, they became popular and many people have one 
B. with a GSM mobile phone, you can make a phone call in most parts of the USA 
C. there are only two cell phone systems in the whole world: GSM and CDMA 
D. most of the mobile phone users in the world now are using the GSM mobile phone 
 Answer: D
Context: New technology links the world as never before. Our planet has shrunk. It's now a ""global village"" where countries are only seconds away by fax or phone or satellite link. And, of course, our ability to benefit from this high-tech communications equipment is greatly increased by foreign language skills.
Deeply involved with this new technology is a kind of modern businesspeople who have a growing respect for the economic value of doing business abroad. In modern markets, success overseas often helps support domestic business efforts.
Overseas assignments   are becoming increasingly important to advancement within executive   ranks. The executive stationed in another country no longer need fear being ""out of sight and out of mind."" He or she can be sure that the overseas effort is central to the company's plan for success, and that promotions often follow or accompany an assignment abroad. If an employee can succeed in a difficult assignment overseas, superiors will have greater confidence in his or her ability to manage back in the United States where cross-cultural considerations and foreign language issues are becoming more and more common.
Thanks to a variety of relatively inexpensive communications devices   with business applications, even small businesses in the United States are able to get into international markets.
English is still the international language of business. But there is an ever-growing need for people who can speak another language. A second language isn't generally required to get a job in business, but having language skills gives a candidate the edge when other qualifications appear to be equal.
The employee posted abroad who speaks the country's language has an opportunity to fast-forward certain negotiations, and can have the cultural insight   to know when it is better to move more slowly. The employee at the home office who can communicate well with foreign customers over the telephone or by fax machine is an obvious asset   to the firm. 
 Question:According to the passage, what is an important consideration of international corporations in employing people today? 
A. Ability to speak the customer's language. 
B. Connections with businesses overseas. 
C. Technical know-how. 
D. Business experience. 
 Answer: A
Context: Cyberspace, data superhighway, multimedia, for those who have seen the future, and the linking of computers, televisions and telephones will change our lives for ever. Yet for all the talks of a forthcoming technological utopia, little attention has been given to the implications of these developments for the poor. As for all the new high technology, the West concerns itself with the ""how"", while the question of ""for whom"" is put aside once again.
Economists are only now realizing the full extent to which the communication revolution has affected the world economy. Information technology allows the extension of trade across geographical and industrial boundaries, and transnational corporations take full advantage of it. Terms of trade and exchange, interest rates and money movements are more important than the production of goods. The electronic economy made by information technology allows the haves to increase their control on global markets -- with a destructive impact on the havenots.
For them the result is unstable. Developing countries which rely on the production of a small range of goods for export are made to feel like small parts in the international economic machine. As ""futures"" are traded on computer screens, developing countries simply have less and less control of their destinies.
So what are the options of regaining control?One alternative for developing countries is to buy in the latest computers and telecommunications. Yet this leads to long-term dependency and perhaps permanent constraints ( ,) on developing countries' economies.
Communication technology is generally exported from the US, Europe or Japan;the patents, skills and ability remain in the hands of a few industrialized countries. It is also expensive, therefore imported products and services must be bought on credit usually provided by the very countries whose companies stand to gain. 
 Question:It can be inferred from the passage that   _   . 
A. international trade should be expanded 
B. the interests of the poor countries have not been given enough consideration 
C. the exports of the poor countries should be increased 
D. communication technology in developing countries should be modernized 
 Answer: B
Context: TOKYO-- At first glance, Japanese cellphones are young people's favorites, with elegant design and quick access to the Internet. However, despite years of competition in overseas markets, Japan's cellphone makers have little presence beyond the country's shores.
The only Japanese cellphone maker with any meaningful global share is Sony Ericsson, and that company is a London-based joint venture between a Japanese electronics maker and a Swedish telecommunications firm.
And Sony Ericsson has been hit by big losses. Its market share was just 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009, behind Nokia of Finland, Samsung Electronics and LG of South Korea, and Motorola of Illinois.
This year, Mr Natsuno, who developed a popular wireless Internet service called i-Mode, invited some of the best minds in the field to debate how Japanese cellphones could go global.
""The most amazing thing about Japan is that even the average person out there will have a very advanced phone, ""said Mr Natsuno. Japan has 100 million users of advanced third-generation smart phones, twice the number of the United States, a much larger market. Many Japanese rely on their phones, not a PC, for Internet access.
Indeed, Japanese cellphone makers thought they had positioned themselves to dominate the age of digital data. But they were a little too clever. In the 1990s, they set a standard for the second-generation network that was refused everywhere else. Then Japan quickly adopted a third-generation standard in 2001. However, it made Japanese phones too advanced for most markets.
Several Japanese companies are now considering a push into overseas markets, including NEC. Panasonic, Sharp, Toshiba and Fujitsu are said to be planning similar moves.
""Japanese cellphone makers need to either look overseas, or exit the business"", said Kenshi Tazaki, a managing vice president at the consulting firm Gartner Japan. 
 Question:Which of the following would be the best title for the passage? 
A. Japanese cellphone companies are unsuccessful. 
B. Japan has more cellphone users than the US. 
C. Japanese cellphone industry intends to expand overseas markets. 
D. Going global--a difficult task for Japanese companies.

Context: What is a six-letter word that immediately comes to mind when you need some information on the Internet? You probably thought of Google. But Google wasn't always the name of the famous search engine. In fact, the original name was BackRub!
BackRub was the name two graduate students gave to the new search engine they developed in 1996. They called it BackRub because the engine used backlinks to measure the popularity of Web sites. Later, they wanted a better name -- a name that suggests huge quantities of data. They thought of the word googol. (A googol is a number followed by 100 zeros.) When they checked the Internet registry of names to see if googol was already taken, one of the students misspelled the word by mistake, and that's how Google was born.
Google is just one example of a name change in the business world. Many other companies have decided to change their names or the names of their products. Here are some more examples:
Jerry Yang and David Filo, two young computer specialists, developed a guide to Internet content in 1994. They called it ""Jerry and David's Guide to World Wide Web."" But they soon realized that this wasn't a very catchy name, so they searched through a dictionary and found a better one: ""Yahoo.""
Sometimes companies change their names because of the popularity of one of their products. In 1962, a young runner named Phil Knight started a company called Blue Ribbon Sports. In 1971, Knight decided to design and manufacture his own brand of shoes. He named the shoes after the Greek goddess of victory -- Nike. Nike shoes became so well known that Knight changed the name of the whole company to Nike. 
 Question:Jerry and David changed the guide's name to Yahoo because the original name  _  . 
A. had been registered 
B. had been forgotten 
C. was not attractive 
D. was too short 
 Answer: C

Diane Burke of Weeks bury, Kentucky
I think it would definitely be an interesting combination. Everyone recognizes the names Yahoo and Microsoft, but everyone also says, ""Did you Google it?"" Such a catchphrase   is going to be hard to beat.
Shaun Carney of Laurelville, Ohio
I think the merger   will provide more competitions for Google. I don't think the merger will allow Microsoft to develop faster than Google, though. I believe the increased competition this merger brings will force Google to stay on top of its game by offering more fresh and original Internet tools and expanding on the tools it already offers.
Toni Suarez of Hacienda Heights, California
I view the merger as a necessary element in preventing a monopolization  . Perhaps it would bring better high technology innovations to e-mail and help in researching and developing a better Internet!
Rick R. of Edgewater, Florida
It sounds like a disaster to me. If this were to happen, I would stop using my Yahoo e-mail account because I don't like the feeling of Microsoft spying upon my business. I will sign up for Google.
Antonio Glosser of Kansas City, Missouri
Right now, Yahoo offers a lot of features and tools at no cost for all different levels of Internet users. Microsoft seeks nothing but profit. Undoubtedly, they'll do nothing other than find ways to start removing Yahoo's formerly non-priced features. Microsoft's greed will ruin the great thing that Yahoo currently is. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage? 
A. Shaun's attitude towards Google is passive. 
B. Toni believes the Internet will have a promising future. 
C. Rick will support Google after the merger. 
D. Antonio is afraid that the merger will cost Yahoo's free features.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT.""

A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B
Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT."" 
 Question:The price of the knives was cut down by half because   _  . 
A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap 
D. the knives were produced in one factory

Context: When you buy a T-shirt, or a fur coat in a store, it often carries a label telling who made it or from what store it was bought. Instead, some labels show the dress is famous and it is very expensive, so buyers secretly wish they could be carried forever. On the other hand, buyers who deal with the cheapest products would be pleased to be away with labels  _ .
However, there is another label more important than the one showing from which store the dress was bought. When a person buys a fur coat, or a jacket from a store, a label telling what the product is made of should be carried to it.
The label is required by law. Besides telling what the product on show is made of, the label should be in clear English and be where one can find it easily. The information on the label must be true.
The reason for this is that most buyers today aren't expert enough to know exactly what kind of fur or material they are buying. The buyers must believe in the store that sells the products or in what the label says. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE? 
A. A T-shirt seldom carries a label. 
B. A fur coat with a high price often carries a false label. 
C. A label only says what material the product is made of. 
D. Not all buyers know the materials they are buying.

Context: My life plan is to visit all the states in the US. Several years ago, my husband and I were traveling in the northwest. One day, when we were having our breakfast, I lost my wallet that had over $300 in it. There was no way for us to be able to find it, but we went on with our trip.
We went off to drive around and enjoy the city, completely forgetting my missing wallet. Later on, when I checked my phone, there was a message from the boss of the restaurant where we had our breakfast:
""I have something that belongs to you, and you're going to be very happy.""
We got back to the restaurant and there was the wallet on the table with all the money in it!
The boss's son found the wallet in front of the door, and brought it to him. He thought that it must belong to someone who had a meal in the restaurant, so he checked inside and found my phone number on a piece of paper. 
 Question:According to the passage, we can say that   _  . 
A. the writer always lost things during her trips 
B. the message was a good surprise to the writer 
C. the wallet was not important for the writer 
D. the writer didn't mind that she had lost her wallet 
 Answer: B
Context: Recently, I experienced a wonderful lesson in how little things still mean a lot. My brother, mother and I live in a very rural district on the Big Island of Hawaii. Our farm is at least a dozen miles from the most basic of services. Consequently, we take weekly trips to COSTCO to procure fuel and supplies. About a month ago, we'd finished loading up the SUV and prepared to leave. As I settled into my seat, I glanced down at the roadside, when a piece of paper caught my eye. I picked it up and read it carefully. Instantly, I was grateful I did.
The form turned out to be a receipt from the State Motor Vehicle Division, documenting the owners' payment of their Vehicle's Registration fees. Quickly, I put myself in their shoes and figured: no one would throw this out, especially if it was current. I also looked over the form for contact or any personal data, perhaps a license tag or telephone number. But that seemed impractical. Although the form had been born on the wind, where in the busy, crowded parking lot would I find the owners? Had it been lying there for a few minutes or a week? So I checked the date, the fees paid, noted the names of the owners and pocketed the receipt. Recalling the parable of the Good Samaritan, I concluded that the best and easiest step to take was to put the form in an envelope addressed to the couple and send it to them by post. Further, I imagined how crazy I'd be if I had misplaced my receipt. Much easier to attempt returning it than to leave them angry, upset, etc. over the loss.
By the end of the week, I received a beautiful thank-you letter from a very grateful and happy couple containing a hand written message and a gift card to use at any Starbuck's. In her note, the wife explained how a gust of wind snatched their receipt from a pocket in her car's passenger door. They had panicked and searched crazily for quite some time before giving up. It felt great to know I'd helped someone avoid a major loss by doing something that at first glance seemed minor or even unimportant. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the short passage? 
A. I rode my car to COSTCO to buy supplies a month ago. 
B. The receipt was out of date, so the owner threw it away. 
C. I waited on the roadside for the receipt owner for half a day. 
D. I called up the owner to take back the receipt. 
 Answer: A
Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

Context: The horsepower was first used two hundred years ago. James Watt had made the world's first widely used steam engine. He had no way of telling people exactly how powerful it was, for at that time there were no units for measuring power.
    Watt decided to find out how much work one strong horse could do in one minute. He called that init one horsepower. With this unit he could measure the work his steam engine could do.
    He discovered that a horse could lift a 3,300-pound weight 10 feet into the air in one minute. His engine could lift a 3,300 pound weight 100 feet in one minute.
    Because his engine did ten times as much work as the horse, Watt called it a ten-horsepower engine.

Context: On the old-time farm in America, there were chickens, cows, pigs and horses. But there were very few machines. Most of the work was done by the farm family. Sometimes more workmen were needed in busy seasons. Work done by horses took up 79 percent; by men, 15 percent; and machine work only took up 6 percent.
Today all that has changed. On many modern farms machines now will do 96 percent of the work, while man does 3 percent. As for horses, they do 1 percent of the whole work. The children go to school by bus every morning; the parents work on the farm or in the house and other people's help is hardly needed. Their work has been replaced by a whole army of farm machines. 
 Question:Today on an American farm machines do   _   times more work than in the past.

Context: In Britain in the 1890s there was a postcard ""craze "". People formed clubs and collected and exchanged postcards. Even Queen Victoria had her own private collection.
When Edward was the king, the British had a cheap and good postal system. If anyone wanted to tell a friend that they were coming for tea in the afternoon, they would send a postcard in the morning. ""Drop me a card"" was as common then as ""give me a ring"" as now.
In 1902 an important step was taken. The government said that half of the side that was used for the address on the postcard could be used for messages, and the whole of the other side could be used for a picture. It was then that the simple postcard, as we know now, was created. 
 Question:Which statement is TRUE? 
A. Postcards were not used in the 19th century. 
B. It was not until 1902 that the simple postcard as we know was created. 
C. Postcards were used only for collection in the 1890s.

Context: Sparrow is a fast-food chain with 200 restaurants. Some years ago, the group to which Sparrow belonged was taken over by another company. Although Sparrow showed no sign of declining, the chain was generally in an unhealthy state. With more and more fast-food concepts reaching the market, the Sparrow menu had to struggle for attention. And to make matters worse, its new owner had no plans to give it the funds it required.
Sparrow failed to grow for another two years. Until a new CEO, Carl Pearson, decided to build up its market share. He did a survey, which showed that consumers who already used Sparrow restaurants were extremely positive about the chain, while customers of other fast-food chains were unwilling to turn away from them. Sparrow had to develop a new promotional campaign.
Pearson faced a battle over the future of the Sparrow brand. The chain's owner now favored rebranding Sparrow as Marcy's restaurants. Pearson resisted, arguing for an advertising campaign designed to convince customers that visits to Sparrow restaurants were fun. Such an attempt to establish a positive relationship between a company and the general public was unusual for that time. Pearson strongly believed that numbers were the key to success, rather than customers' speeding power. Finally, the owner accepted his idea.
The campaign itself changed the traditional advertising style of the fast-food industry. The TV ads of Sparrow focused on entertainment and featured original songs performed by a variety of stars. Instead of showing the superiority of a specific product, the intention was to put Sparrow in the hearts of potential customers.
Pearson also made other decisions which he believed would contribute to the new Sparrow image. For example, he offered to lower the rent of any restaurants which achieved a certain increase in their turnover   .
These efforts paid off, and Sparrow soon became one of the most successful fast-food chains in the regions where it operated. 
 Question:What was Pearson's achievement as a CEO? 
A. He managed to pay off Sparrow's debts. 
B. He made Sparrow much more competitive 
C. He helped Sparrow take over a company 
D. He improved the welfare of Sparrow employees 
 Answer: B
Context: New rules will let millions of Americans know where more of their food comes from. The law is known as COOL -- Country of Origin Labeling .
American congress first passed the law in 2002. Stores have had to label seafood by country of origin since 2005. But industry pressure delayed other requirements until last week.
Products that must now be labeled include fresh fruits and vegetables, muscle meats and some kinds of nuts. But the rules are complex, and many foods are not included. For example, organ meats are free to be labeled. So are processed foods, including cooked or smoked foods.
The same food may sometimes have to be labeled and other times not. Fresh or frozen peas, for example, have to be labeled but not canned peas. Foods that are mixed with other foods are also excluded. Mixed nuts, for example, do not need to be labeled. The same is true of a salad mix that contains different things like lettuce and carrots. Or a fruit cup that combines different fruits. Also, the law doesn't include restaurants and other food service organizations. Department of Agriculture officials say the law is really meant for larger grocery stores.
The United States has imported more and more food in recent years to save money and expand choices. Country-of-origin labeling has become more common lately but has still been limited in many stores.
Food safety is one reason why some shoppers pay close attention to where foods came from. For example, when a large number of people recently got sick from salmonella , officials blamed peppers from Mexico. Yet the last big food scare involved spinach grown in California. But labeling is also a way for people to know they are getting what they want. Some want to buy local foods or foods from a particular country.
The country-of-origin labeling law gives stores 30 days to correct any violations  that are found. Stores and suppliers that are found to be deliberately violating the law could be fined 1,000 dollars per violation. Federal inspectors are not to take action to enforce the law for six months to give time for an education campaign.
Some food safety activists say they are generally pleased with the law. They call it a good step that will give people more useful information. 
 Question:The new rules of the country-of-origin labeling law will come into effect  _  . 
A. right now 
B. in a month 
C. in three months 
D. in half a year

Context: A U.S. dad quit his job, giving up a massive salary, after his 10-year-old daughter gave him a 22-point list outlining all the events he missed so far during the year. As the CEO of the $2 trillion global investment fund PIMCO, Mohamed El-Erian shocked the finance industry when he quit in January.
El-Erian said it was about a year ago when he was repeatedly asking his daughter to brush her teeth, but she wasn't listening. When he asked her why, she responded with a list of 22 milestones he had missed: like the first day of school and the first soccer game of the season.
""And the school year wasn't yet over,"" El-Erian wrote. ""I felt awful and got defensive: I had a good excuse for each missed event! Travel, important meetings, and urgent phone call, sudden to-dos. But it dawned on me that I was missing an infinitely more important point. My work-life balance had gotten out of whack, and the imbalance was hurting my very special relationship with my daughter. I was not making enough time for her."" El-Erian explained he was struggling with the same thing so many parents do--work-life balance.
Dads who are quitting their profit-making jobs to improve work-life balance is a subject that is getting more traction as some high-profile executive have recently written about their experiences.
Last month, former MongoDB CEO Max Schireson wrote a blog post for Time about his decision to step down from the company's top job. He wrote that he struggled to make time for his three children because he was flying around half a million kilometres a year for work.
""I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car, or when my son had an emergency surgery,"" Schireson wrote.
On an overnight flight to Texas he woke up in Arizona to discover the plane made an emergency landing and some traumatized crew members had to be replaced. He decided it was time to address his work-life balance.
Quitting is something El-Erian and Schireson were financially able to do, but El-Erian recognizes most people don't have this luxury. He hopes companies will pay attention to improving work-life balance for their employees.
El-Erian now manages ""a portfolio of part-time jobs"" that don't require as much travel. He alternates mornings with his wife taking their daughter to school and he often picks her up from school.
""So far, it's been the right decision for me,"" he wrote. ""I'm so grateful that this is providing me greater opportunity to experience key moments in my daughter's life before they're all too quickly gone."" 
 Question:El-Erian resigned from PIMCO mainly because   _  . 
A. his daughter has been missing him badly 
B. he was getting bored with the endless flights 
C. he hoped to get his daughter to listen to her 
D. he wanted to experience his daughter's milestones

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: It is a matter of common observation that although money income keeps going up over the years, we never seem to become richer. Prices are rising continuously. This condition is what we call inflation: the money supply is becoming inflated so that each unit of it becomes less valuable. We have got used to higher and higher rates of inflation in recent years. What could be bought twenty years ago for one pound now costs well over 2 pounds. And at present this rate of inflation seems to be rising rather than falling. If in the real world our money incomes go up at the same rate as prices do. One might think that inflation doesn't matter. _ When money is losing value it also loses one of the qualities of a good money--stability of value. It is no longer acceptable as a store of value; and it becomes an unsuitable means of delayed payment. Nobody wants to hold a wasting possession, so people try to get rid of money as quickly as possible. Inflation therefore simply stimulates our spending and discourages saving. 
 Question:.We can conclude according to the passage that   _  . 
A. the writer is a government official 
B. the writer is worried about inflation 
C. the writer encourages people to spend money 
D. the writer has become richer because of inflation 
 Answer: B
Context: When Denis Hennequin took over as the European boss of McDonald's in January 2004, the world's biggest restaurant chain was showing signs of recovery in America and Australia, but sales in Europe were sluggish or declining.One exception was France, where Mr.Hennequin had done a reliable job as head on the group's French subsidiary  to sell more Big Macs to his relatives, His task was to copy this success in all 41 of the European countries where anti-globalisers' favourite enemy operates.
So far Mr.Henncquin is doing well.Last year European sales increased by 5.8% and the number of customers by 3.4%, the best annual results in nearly 15 years.Europe accounted for 36% of the group's profits and for 28 of its sales.December was an especially good month as customers took to seasonal menu offerings in France and Britain, and to a promotion in Germany based on the game of Monopoly .
Mr.Hennequin's recipe for revival  is to be more open about his company's operations, to be ""locally relevant"", and to improve the experience of visiting his 6.400 restaurants. McDonaId's is blamed for making people fat, exploiting workers, treating animals cruelly, polluting the environment and simply for being American.Mr.Hennequin says he wants to engage in a dialogue with the public to address these concerns.
He introduced ""open door"" visitor days in each country which became hugely popular.In Poland alone some 50,000 visitors came to McDonaId's through the visitors' program last year.The Nutrition Information Initiative launched last year, put detailed Sables on McDonaId's packaging with data on calories, protein, fat, carbohy drates and salt content, ""the details are also printed on tray-liners. 
 Question:What did Denis Hennequin do to increase the sales of McDonald in Europe? 
A. He visited all the McDonaId's branches in Europe. 
B. He introduced ""open door"" visitor's days in each country. 
C. He had done a reliable job as head of the group's French subsidiary. 
D. He engaged in a dialogue with the public. 
 Answer: B
Context: It is ""one of the few bright spots in the Chinese economy,"" says Zeng Ming. He is talking about e-commerce. Mr Zeng, the chief strategy officer for Alibaba, a giant Chinese Internet firm, predicts that digital transactions on his firm's platforms will top l trillion yuan ($159 billion) this year-more than Amazon's and eBay's combined. That is a bold claim, but consider what happened on Singles Sunday.
Invented a few years ago by students and seized upon by digital marketers, this festival for lonely hearts falls annually on the  llth day of the llth month (since l is the loneliest number).It is like St Valentine's Day, only worse. Singletons shower each other with tender gifts: a barrage of pearls; a storm of sweets.
This November llth they spent a surprising 19 billion yuan on Alibaba's online platforms-a fourfold increase on a year ago, and more than double what Americans spent online last Cyber Monday (the Monday after Thanksgiving, when retailers urge Americans to shop online). About 100m purchases were logged, accounting for 80% of the packages shipped that day. Couriers  were buried in parcels.
So life is good for China's e-tailers, then? Not exactly. The number of digital marketers is increasing and online sales are booming. Consumers are enjoying lower prices, better service and more variety. The problem? The pressure on profits in Chinese e-commerce is worse than in America, reckons Elinor Leung of CLSA, a broker. ""Almost no one makes money,"" she says.
The fiercest battles are being fought between online retailers and their bricks-and-mortar  rivals.Dangdang, a firm. that resembles Amazon,.and 360buy, another online retailer, have cut prices fiercely. Tencent, a cash-rich online giant known for its instant-messaging software, is splashing out to win market share. 360buy has also just raised $400m from investors to do the same. But it is unclear how much longer such firms can burn through capital. 
 Question:According to Zeng Ming, this year Alibaba will_. 
A. outweigh Amazon and eBay in worldwide influence 
B. rank top among all the Internet firms 
C. have more than 159 billion dollars' sale 
D. create another sales miracle just like the one on Singles Day

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting.

But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns.

A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

Context: How many times have you heard the expression that most people spend more time planning their vacation than they do planning their lives. I would explain that expression by adding that most people spend more time ""thinking"" about their vacation than they do thinking about what's important in their life. 
While rest and relaxation are a must in living a balanced life, it's not what we were created to do. After all, the Master Creator took his R&R (Rest and Recreation) on the seventh day, only after six days of ""definitely directed thought."" 1
My friend Mike Litman wrote an article this week. 2It's called ""The Millionaire Composite"" and it analyzes one of the big differences between super-successful people and everyone else. He wrote ""I recently visited a Real Estate Multi Millionaire Mogul. What did I see next to his desk? His vision   statement, along with a list of what he values in life-handwritten.""
""A few months back, I interviewed an individual Marco Dorigo who sold over a billion dollars worth of products on television. He told me that he read his life and business vision and goals daily, and that he took time to imagine exactly what he wanted to create each night before falling asleep.""
What is your life's purpose or your personal task statement? Is it written down? Do you review it and think about it often? 3Is your life organized around your purpose and a set of goals that support that purpose?
Without purpose and goals - certainly directed thought-you are like ""ship without a rudder. "" There is power in your purpose and in your goals.4
One of my favorite passages of James Allen is one he wrote in The Mastery of Destiny:
""All successful people are people of purpose. They hold fast to an idea, a project, a plan, and will not let it go; they treasure it and develop it; and when upset by difficulties, they refuse to give in; the greater the difficulties are, the stronger the purpose is. "" And that's worth thinking about. 
 Question:The supporting sentence ""It is the power that helps you out of difficulties, the fuel that drives you toward the life you want."" should be placed at_. 
A. 1 
B. 2 
C. 3 
D. 4 
 Answer: D
Context: When 7-year-old Warren Buffett said, ""I will be the richest man one day,"" his friends made fun of his ""daydreaming"". But ever since then the little boy has set about learning how to make money by selling drinks, delivering newspaper and buying stocks. The American had already earned $9,000 (equal to $90,000 today) by the time he graduated from the high school.
And this month the 78-year-old, who earned his fortune by making a lot of sound investment in the stock market, took the place of Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, as the world's richest man. Gates' worth declined $1.5 billion to $55.5 billion in 33 days after the recent financial storm, according to Forbes Magazine.
Buffett, the only son of a stockbroker, was ready to think outside the box to develop his business from a very early age. At 8, he went to golf courses collecting and selling the used balls. At 11 when he sold soda pop door-to-door with a friend, the pair collected lids on streets to judge which flavor was the most popular.
As a paper boy during high school, Buffett delivered two competitor papers, so that even when customers canceled one of the subscriptions   , he could still make a profit from the other. With his paper delivery savings, Buffett bought 162,000 square meters of farmland and collected rent. Young Buffett stepped into the stock market at 11 but earned only $5. The experience taught him one of the virtues in investing patience.
After graduating from university, Buffett started his venture with stocks with his childhood earnings and money from friends. He researched the stocks and just bought those of solid companies that were undervalued and inexpensive at the time. By sticking to companies such as American Express and Coca-Cola, Buffett has become rich.
""Learning is important to Buffett's success. He is a learning machine who can spend his entire day reading. He keeps learning from books, street smarts and investigation, from both success and failure. In this way, he over achieved his aptitude  ,"" said Charlie Munger, his longtime business partner. 
 Question:What can we infer from the passage? 
A. Buffett is an immediate success in the stock market 
B. Buffett and Gates are business partners. 
C. His father helped him a lot in his business. 
D. Buffett has a good sense of business.

Context: The general objective of public interest advertising is to inform, persuade, or remind people about the particular idea, cause, or philosophy being advertised. This kind of advertising is often used by non-business institutions, such as schools, hospitals and charity organizations. We also see advertising by associations. In addition, we witness millions of dollars' worth of advertising placed by government organizations. Much government advertising announces the availability of such valuable government services as consumer assistance, welfare aid, or career guidance. However, with the resource available to it, the government can also use advertising techniques for propaganda purposes. Many state governments use advertising to attract new businesses, tourists, or workers to aid their economy.
Because of the fact that public interest advertising is nonprofit, the words it uses are much more different from the other 3 kinds of advertising. Its purpose is not to urge readers to spend their money, but to disseminate a kind of concept or advocate a social ethic. The headline of public interest advertising also acts as a role of attraction. The average words of them are 10.6, and most of them are curious headlines (60%) and emotional headlines (30%). We can know from the statistics that attracting the reader is still a main task for the headline of public interest advertising, because only when the readers feel the advertising will benefit them (no matter physically or mentally) should they have the patience to read it further--that's the rule of all the advertisements. I also notice that only 10% of those advertisements include their advertiser's brand, which shows that the public interest advertisements do not aim to propagandize any company or organization. Straight-line body copy is the most frequently used form--which is 50% of the 20 ads. 75% of those ads have used imperative sentences. Most of these sentences are urging readers to take action immediately for others or social ethics. All these data show the fact that public interest advertising does not please readers by beautiful words or original ideas, but touch them through true feelings. 
 Question:What can we learn from the passage? 
A. Public interest advertising encourages people to buy goods. 
B. Public interest advertising sometimes forces concepts upon the public. 
C. We cannot see any advertiser's brand in public interest advertisements. 
D. The words of public interest advertisements are mostly emotional. 
 Answer: D
Context: Language has a powerful influence over people and their behaviour. This is especially true in the fields of advertising. Visual content and design in advertising have a very great impact on the consumers,but it is language that helps people to identify a product and keep it in mind. The choice of language to show specific messages with the intention of influencing people is of vital importance.
The English language is known for its extensive vocabulary. While many other languages have only one or two words to carry a particular meaning,English may have five or six. Moreover,the meanings of these five or six words may differ very slightly and in a very subtle  way. It is important to understand the connotation  of a word. ""Armchair"",for example,suggests comfort,whereas ""chair"" causes no particular feelings. Different people sometimes interpret language in different ways.
Both the mass media,when reporting news items,and marketing and advertising personnel have to consider the emotive power of the words they use. First,they make a decision about what to communicate and what to withhold .One way in which advertisers adapt language to their own use is to take compound words and use them as adjectives. Examples of these compounds are:top-quality,economysize,chocolateflavoured,featherlight and longerlasting. These compounds have become part of the English language.
The language of advertising always emphasizes  why one product stands out in comparison with the others. Don't expect advertising language to be always correct in the normal sense. For example,comparatives are often used when no real comparison is made. An advertisement for a detergent  may say ""It gets clothes whiter"",but whiter than what? 
 Question:When choosing words for their products,advertisers should consider  _  . 
A. whether the words are easy to remember 
B. what emotion the words can bring to people 
C. whether the words are popular and in fashion 
D. which group of people will be interested in them 
 Answer: B

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns.

A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.

Context: If you go to Finland, you'll be surprised to find how ""foolish"" the Finnish people are.
Take the taxi drivers for example. Taxis in Finland are mostly high class Benz with a fare   of two US dollars a kilometer. You can go anywhere in one, tell the driver to drop you at any place, say that you have some business to attend to, and then get off without paying your fare. And the driver would not show the least sign of worry.
The dining rooms in all big hotels not only serve their guests, but also outside diners. Hotel guests have their meals free, so their good faith is to wave their registration card to the waiter. With such a loose check, you can easily use any old registration card to take a couple of friends and dine free of charge.
With so many loopholes   in everyday life, surely Finland must be a heaven to those who love to take ""pretty advantages"". But the strange things is, all the taxi-passengers would always come back to pay their fare after they have attended to their business; not a single outsider has ever been found in the free hotel dining rooms. As the Finns always act on good faith and always show an attitude of ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" in everything they do, so to live in such a society has turned everyone into a real ""gentleman"". In a society of such high moral practice, what need is there for people to take precautions   against others? 
 Question:The sentences ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" show that   _  . 
A. the Finns are foolish 
B. the Finns take things seriously 
C. the Finns are busy making money for the family 
D. the Finns never take precaution against others

Context: Dear Mr. Watson,
CLAIM AL54323432--STORM DAMAGE TO ROOF
     I received a cheque for $623 dated 26 January in payment of my recent claim . However, I wish to tell you how upset I have been by the way your Claims Assessor, Mr. Michael Tan, handled this claim. 
    When Mr. Tan first called me, he specifically told me that he believed I had been overcharged, and he would expect to pay that price for work on a double garage, rather than a single garage like mine. Mr. Tan suggested that I neither use nor recommend this contractor again. He continued to tell me it was unlikely for me to receive full payment. Never during this conversation did he mention that the reason for not receiving full payment was because of the nature of my insurance policy. 
    Consequently, I wrote to Mr. Lance Ashe to complain about his pricing, stating that I was very upset thinking that he could have taken advantage by overcharging a 73-year-old woman. Mr. Ashe telephoned me immediately and explained his charges in detail. He later reported back to me that Mr. Tan explained that I would not receive full payment because of the type of policy I hold, which does not cover wear and tear. This was the first time this issue had been brought to my attention, so you can imagine my surprise. 
   When I received Mr. Tan's letter of 2 February, this situation was explained. If this had been explained in the first place I would have accepted it and would not have questioned Mr. Ashe's charges. Instead, by telling me initially that I had been overcharged for this work, he caused a great deal of upset, not only for me but also for Mr. Ashe. 
    I believed this claim was handled badly by Mr. Tan from the beginning. Therefore, a great deal of embarrassment has been caused over this issue. 
I felt you should know how disappointed and upset I am. I trust you will look into this and ensure that such claims are handled more appropriately in the future. 
                                               Yours sincerely,
                                                    Mrs. Richard 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that Mr. Tan works in a/an   _  . 
A. welfare organization 
B. nursing house 
C. local affairs office 
D. insurance company

Context: TOKYO - Japan is considering plans to calm tensions with China by acknowledging  Chinese claims to the disputed islands in the East China Sea, while maintaining its own position, Kyodo News cited sources as saying on Tuesday.
The report said that the plans would allow Japan, without changing its long-held position, to _ a little with China, which has called on Tokyo to acknowledge the existence  of a dispute over the Chinese Diaoyu Islands, referred to as Senkaku Islands in Japan.
Japan has refused to rescind its recent purchase  in mid-September of three of the five Diaoyu islands from a so-called private Japanese owner, which the government says was meant to maintain the uninhabited islands in a stable manner, despite China's strong protest.
It remains uncertain, however, whether China would be encouraged by the Japanese step to improve the tensioned ties, said Kyodo.

A. Japan will give in. 
B. China is against Japan's purchase of Diaoyu islands. 
C. The problem between China and Japan has been settled.

Context: A new report says only about half of all students in the main school systems of America's largest cities finish high school. The report notes higher rates of graduation -- over 70% --in areas surrounding the cities. Researchers studied high school graduation rates from the 2003, 2004 school year. They also identified the nation's fifty largest cities. The largest, New York City, had a population of more than eight million. The smallest city was Wichita, Kansas. It had about three hundred and sixty thousand people.
Researchers used a system of measurement called the cumulative promotion index to find graduation rates. School officials in many of the cities studied said the resulting numbers were too low. That is because different areas use different methods to find graduation rates. Critics say many methods do not give a true _ of the number of students who leave high school before finishing.
Other studies have put the national graduation rate at about 70%. But experts agree that too many students are not completing high school. They estimate the number at more than one million each year. The report was prepared for America's Promise Alliance. The private group aims to help children receive services they need to succeed.
General Colin Powell was chairman of America's Promise Alliance when it was formed in 1997. He attended the press conference Tuesday where the report was released. He said studies have shown that the US must do more to educate the leaders and work force of the future.
Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings also spoke. She said the government will propose that states use the same methods when reporting graduation rates. Alliance officials also announced the start of a nationwide campaign to improve graduation rates. It is to include a series of meetings to be held in every state over the next two years. The meetings will bring together elected leaders, business owners, students, parents and education officials. They will develop plans to increase the number of Americans who finish high school. 
 Question:The author wants to tell us   _  . 
A. too many Americans do not finish high school 
B. different methods to find graduation rates 
C. services American children need to receive 
D. the increase of the number of Americans who finish their high school

Context: In 2007.five young people in the American state of Massachusetts developed an idea. The team knew that the world is filled with mobile phones.About eighty percent of all people are said to live within reach of a wireless telephone signal.    
    The idea was to use mobile phones and the Internet to connect job seekers with employers.The young people wrote a business plan and formed a company called Assured Labor.
    Assured Labor won a development competition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Three of the founders were graduate students there.    '
    Assured Labo is an electronic market place.It has two parts.One is for;the United States.That operation was launched in January in Boston.It links people with employees offering temporary jobs.
    The other arm of the business is for developing markets.That operation is meant to help people get mbfe permanent jobs.A representative is currently building partnerships with universities,and international companies in Central America.
    Assured Labor's president David Reich,says the companies now place job advertisements on radio or in newspapers.Some even drive around in cars with loudspeakers announcing that jobs are available.He says the companies are interested.in having more modem hiring practices.
    Through Assured Labor, companies will list open positions on the Internet.People who think
 they could do the job could reply by text messages or on their cellophanes.
    This is how the system works inprefix = st1 /Boston.
The jobs available include house cleaning.Dog walking and home repay. People who want their house cleaned,for example,can look online at a list of twenty housekeepers.The list tells what services.they offer,and how much they want to be paid.People need two letters praising their work to get on the list of service providers.
    The employer chooses workers they would like jot hire ,The company then sends the workers a text or e-mail message so they can respond quickly to an offer.
    After a job is completed,the employer and employee rate each other, The rating is kept for  future use.Assured Labor is not charging anyone,right now, but the plan is to have employers pay for the service. 
 Question:what kinds of jobs does Assured Labor offer? 
A. Temporary jobs. 
B. Permanent jobs. 
C. Free jobs 
D. Both A and B*

Context: Tobacco companies are fighting efforts in the United States and Australia to make their products less appealing. In Washington, a federal judge last week blocked the Food and Drug Administration from requiring new warning labels on cigarette packs. Judge Richard Leon ruled in a case brought by five tobacco companies. The judge temporarily stopped a new federal rule which requires large new warnings starting next September. These include color1 images such as a dead body or diseased lungs. And simple text warnings now appear.
Congress called for color1 images showing the dangers of smoking, similar to what Canada does. But the tobacco companies say the new requirements approved in June violate   their free speech rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Judge Leon said the FDA could not require the new labels before a lawsuit  against the government is decided. Some experts say the process could take years. The judge said he believed the cigarette makers were highly likely to win their case.
He said the images should be designed to appeal to emotions, rejecting government arguments that they should be purely factual. He accused the government of trying to use the labels to promote an ""obvious anti-smoking agenda?""
The head of an anti-smoking group, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the decision ""wrong on the science and wrong on the law"".
About one-fifth of American adults smoke. The World Health Organization says tobacco kills nearly six mil-lion people worldwide each year. More than six hundred thousand of them are non-smokers who breathe other people's tobacco smoke.
In Australia, tobacco companies want to stop what would be the world's most restrictive laws on cigarette advertising. Cigarettes could be sold only in plain olive-green packages. Only the brand name and health warnings could appear. The Senate passed the bill last week and sent it back to the Lower House to approve minor amendments  . The law is to go into effect in December of next year.
Tobacco companies Say the legislation   violates the Australian constitution. They say it would unjustly reduce the value of their brand names and trademarks. Health Minister Nicola Roxon says the government is ready for a legal fight. 
 Question:What are the tobacco companies ii1 the United States and Australia fighting against? 
A. The requirements to sell fewer products to the public. 
B. The requirements to print new warning labels on their products. 
C. The measures to make their products more attractive. 
D. The ways to make the companies close their business.

Context: Eighth-grader Victoria Bills is talking about money with her classmates. She is worried that a company's stock   price could fall. It may be an unusual topic of conversation for a 13-year-old. But at Bills' school in Chicago, US, you hear it all the time.
The Chicago school's 420 students learn about economic . They also get a chance to make money. Each 1stgrade and 5thgrade, students learn the basics of economics and investing .
Then in 6thgrade, they put what they've learned to work. Students join a junior group that manages the $20,000. The group, made up of 12 to 14 students, decides which stocks to buy.
After graduating, students pass on $20,000 to the next 1stgrade class. They keep half of the rest of the money; the other half goes toward improving the school. They can choose to put their money in a college-savings program or take the cash.
In 2007, Bills suggested that her class buy the stock of the Apple computer company. This was just before the iPhone came out. ""We bought stock just at the right time,"" she says. The kids bought Google stock as it reached $400 a share. It is now worth over $500. ""It was a good buy,"" says Myles Gate, 13. He hopes to be a banker one day.
The school's two graduating classes of 2005 and 2006 have each earned about $10,000 in profits .

A. The teachers. 
B. The school.

Context: New research finds a link between poverty and poor decision making. The findings may explain why poor people sometimes make bad choices that continue their hardship.
     Earlier studies have found the poor less likely to escape poverty. But there has been little research on why the poor make decisions that make their lives harder. Until recently, it was economists who studied poverty, not psychologists. Eldar Shafir, a psychologist in Princeton University says now scientists from both fields work together. Mr. Shafir and his team did two experiments. One took place at a shopping center in New Jersey.  Another was carried out among sugar cane farmers in rural India.
      The New Jersey experiment involved individuals with low paying jobs and others belonged to the middle class. All the volunteers were asked what they would do if their cars needed repairs.
     The volunteers were given two imaginary situations. In the first, the car repairs cost $ 150.  In the second,  $ 1,500.
     ""And what we found is that the poor and the rich performed equally well on almost all the tests. ""
      Not so when the researchers raised the repair costs to $ 1,500.
     ""Now the poor performed significantly worse. "" The poorer lost about 13 IQ points on average. This is about the loss experienced when a person has not slept for one night.
     The scientists then wondered if the same person reacted differently when he was rich and when he was poor. The Indian sugar cane farmers earn most of their money once a year, when the harvest comes in. But the money often does not last through the year.
    ""So they find themselves basically rich after the harvest when the income comes in and poor just before the harvest.
     The researchers gave them tests similar to the ones taken by the people in New Jersey. They tested the Indian farmers before the harvest and after.
     And the results were much the same as with the mall shoppers.
     ""They performed much more slowly and with many more mistakes when they were poorer than when they were richer. ""
     Mr. Shafir says the results support 50 years of research that shows all humans have limited mental power to deal with things in life.
     ""And so the insight here is that, having not enough of something in a way makes it harder to make good decisions for everything else. "" 
 Question:What could be the best title for the passage?_(    ) 
A. Once poor, always poor? 
B. Why are poor people poorer? 
C. Poverty weakens brain power. 
D. Different experiments, different findings.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B

Context: A U.S. dad quit his job, giving up a massive salary, after his 10-year-old daughter gave him a 22-point list outlining all the events he missed so far during the year. As the CEO of the $2 trillion global investment fund PIMCO, Mohamed El-Erian shocked the finance industry when he quit in January.
El-Erian said it was about a year ago when he was repeatedly asking his daughter to brush her teeth, but she wasn't listening. When he asked her why, she responded with a list of 22 milestones he had missed: like the first day of school and the first soccer game of the season.
""And the school year wasn't yet over,"" El-Erian wrote. ""I felt awful and got defensive: I had a good excuse for each missed event! Travel, important meetings, and urgent phone call, sudden to-dos. But it dawned on me that I was missing an infinitely more important point. My work-life balance had gotten out of whack, and the imbalance was hurting my very special relationship with my daughter. I was not making enough time for her."" El-Erian explained he was struggling with the same thing so many parents do--work-life balance.
Dads who are quitting their profit-making jobs to improve work-life balance is a subject that is getting more traction as some high-profile executive have recently written about their experiences.
Last month, former MongoDB CEO Max Schireson wrote a blog post for Time about his decision to step down from the company's top job. He wrote that he struggled to make time for his three children because he was flying around half a million kilometres a year for work.
""I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car, or when my son had an emergency surgery,"" Schireson wrote.
On an overnight flight to Texas he woke up in Arizona to discover the plane made an emergency landing and some traumatized crew members had to be replaced. He decided it was time to address his work-life balance.
Quitting is something El-Erian and Schireson were financially able to do, but El-Erian recognizes most people don't have this luxury. He hopes companies will pay attention to improving work-life balance for their employees.
El-Erian now manages ""a portfolio of part-time jobs"" that don't require as much travel. He alternates mornings with his wife taking their daughter to school and he often picks her up from school.
""So far, it's been the right decision for me,"" he wrote. ""I'm so grateful that this is providing me greater opportunity to experience key moments in my daughter's life before they're all too quickly gone."" 
 Question:El-Erian resigned from PIMCO mainly because   _  . 
A. his daughter has been missing him badly 
B. he was getting bored with the endless flights 
C. he hoped to get his daughter to listen to her 
D. he wanted to experience his daughter's milestones

Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: On the old-time farm in America, there were chickens, cows, pigs and horses. But there were very few machines. Most of the work was done by the farm family. Sometimes more workmen were needed in busy seasons. Work done by horses took up 79 percent; by men, 15 percent; and machine work only took up 6 percent.
Today all that has changed. On many modern farms machines now will do 96 percent of the work, while man does 3 percent. As for horses, they do 1 percent of the whole work. The children go to school by bus every morning; the parents work on the farm or in the house and other people's help is hardly needed. Their work has been replaced by a whole army of farm machines. 
 Question:Today on an American farm machines do   _   times more work than in the past. 
A. 17 
B. 16 
C. 15 
D. 14

Context: A U.S. dad quit his job, giving up a massive salary, after his 10-year-old daughter gave him a 22-point list outlining all the events he missed so far during the year. As the CEO of the $2 trillion global investment fund PIMCO, Mohamed El-Erian shocked the finance industry when he quit in January.
El-Erian said it was about a year ago when he was repeatedly asking his daughter to brush her teeth, but she wasn't listening. When he asked her why, she responded with a list of 22 milestones he had missed: like the first day of school and the first soccer game of the season.
""And the school year wasn't yet over,"" El-Erian wrote. ""I felt awful and got defensive: I had a good excuse for each missed event! Travel, important meetings, and urgent phone call, sudden to-dos. But it dawned on me that I was missing an infinitely more important point. My work-life balance had gotten out of whack, and the imbalance was hurting my very special relationship with my daughter. I was not making enough time for her."" El-Erian explained he was struggling with the same thing so many parents do--work-life balance.
Dads who are quitting their profit-making jobs to improve work-life balance is a subject that is getting more traction as some high-profile executive have recently written about their experiences.
Last month, former MongoDB CEO Max Schireson wrote a blog post for Time about his decision to step down from the company's top job. He wrote that he struggled to make time for his three children because he was flying around half a million kilometres a year for work.
""I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car, or when my son had an emergency surgery,"" Schireson wrote.
On an overnight flight to Texas he woke up in Arizona to discover the plane made an emergency landing and some traumatized crew members had to be replaced. He decided it was time to address his work-life balance.
Quitting is something El-Erian and Schireson were financially able to do, but El-Erian recognizes most people don't have this luxury. He hopes companies will pay attention to improving work-life balance for their employees.
El-Erian now manages ""a portfolio of part-time jobs"" that don't require as much travel. He alternates mornings with his wife taking their daughter to school and he often picks her up from school.
""So far, it's been the right decision for me,"" he wrote. ""I'm so grateful that this is providing me greater opportunity to experience key moments in my daughter's life before they're all too quickly gone."" 
 Question:El-Erian resigned from PIMCO mainly because   _  . 
A. his daughter has been missing him badly 
B. he was getting bored with the endless flights 
C. he hoped to get his daughter to listen to her 
D. he wanted to experience his daughter's milestones

Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting.

Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns.

He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT.""

A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair.

He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.

Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries

Context: The organization representing British universities has expressed concern about the potential effect of tuition fees after figures showed a drop of more than 6% in student applications with less than a month to go before the deadline for 2013 applications.
Data from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) showed there were 265,784 university applications by UK-based candiates up to 17 Decemeber, 6.3% down on the parallel period in the admissions cycle the year before. While this is less than the 8.4% year-on-uear fall seen in earlier Ucas figures, released in mid-November, the coming January deadline makes it ever more likely that the total 2013 applicant figure will see a second sizeable fall following the introduction of annual fees of up to PS9,000.
Nicola Dandridge, the chairman of Universities UK, said : ""However, we must be concerned about any drops in the numbers applying to university and in particular, we must look closely at how the increase in graduate contributions in England may be affecting the decisions of promising students. However ,the December figures show a drop in numbers across the UK, suggesting that it is not only a question of tuition fees in England putting off from applying.""
A report of the Uncas figures to mid-December shows a 6.5% fall for applicants in England and 11.7% for those in Wales, with smaller drops of 3.9% for Scotland and 0.5% for Nortern Ireland. Scotiish students at home insitiutions pay on fees, while those from Nothern Ireland have fees capped to PS3,575 for Northern Irish universities.
Dandridge added: ""No one should be put off applying to university because of worries about finance.""
""It is important that no one is put off applying to university because they do not have information about the student support available to them. Most new students don't need to pay directly. There will be more financial support for those from poorer families and everyone will make lower loan repayments thatn they do now once they are in well paid jobs."" 
 Question:Compared with the previous year, the fall in student applications is  _  . 
A. 3.9% 
B. 6% 
C. 6.3% 
D. 8.4%

Context: New research finds a link between poverty and poor decision making. The findings may explain why poor people sometimes make bad choices that continue their hardship.
     Earlier studies have found the poor less likely to escape poverty. But there has been little research on why the poor make decisions that make their lives harder. Until recently, it was economists who studied poverty, not psychologists. Eldar Shafir, a psychologist in Princeton University says now scientists from both fields work together. Mr. Shafir and his team did two experiments. One took place at a shopping center in New Jersey.  Another was carried out among sugar cane farmers in rural India.
      The New Jersey experiment involved individuals with low paying jobs and others belonged to the middle class. All the volunteers were asked what they would do if their cars needed repairs.
     The volunteers were given two imaginary situations. In the first, the car repairs cost $ 150.  In the second,  $ 1,500.
     ""And what we found is that the poor and the rich performed equally well on almost all the tests. ""
      Not so when the researchers raised the repair costs to $ 1,500.
     ""Now the poor performed significantly worse. "" The poorer lost about 13 IQ points on average. This is about the loss experienced when a person has not slept for one night.
     The scientists then wondered if the same person reacted differently when he was rich and when he was poor. The Indian sugar cane farmers earn most of their money once a year, when the harvest comes in. But the money often does not last through the year.
    ""So they find themselves basically rich after the harvest when the income comes in and poor just before the harvest.
     The researchers gave them tests similar to the ones taken by the people in New Jersey. They tested the Indian farmers before the harvest and after.
     And the results were much the same as with the mall shoppers.
     ""They performed much more slowly and with many more mistakes when they were poorer than when they were richer. ""
     Mr. Shafir says the results support 50 years of research that shows all humans have limited mental power to deal with things in life.
     ""And so the insight here is that, having not enough of something in a way makes it harder to make good decisions for everything else. "" 
 Question:What could be the best title for the passage?_(    ) 
A. Once poor, always poor? 
B. Why are poor people poorer? 
C. Poverty weakens brain power. 
D. Different experiments, different findings.

 Answer: C
Context: At one time, computers were expected largely to remove the need for paper copies of documents  because they could be stored electronically. But for all the texts that are written, stored and sent electronically, a lot of them are still ending up on paper.
It is difficult to measure the quantity of paper used as a result of use of Internet-connected computers, although just about anyone who works in an office can tell you that when e-mail is introduced, the printers start working overtime. ""I feel in my bones this revolution is causing more trees to be cut down,"" says Ted Smith of the Earth Village Organization.
Perhaps the best sign of how computer and Internet use pushes up demand for paper comes from the high-tech industry itself, which sees printing as one of its most promising new markets. Several Internet companies have been set up to help small businesses print quality documents from a computer. Earlier this week Hewlett-Packard Co. announced a plan to develop new technologies that will enable people to print even more so they can get a hard copy of a business document, a medical record or just a on-line e-mail, even if they are nowhere near a computer. As the company sees it, the more use of the Internet the greater demand for printers.
Does all this mean environmental concerns   have been forgotten? Some activists suggest people have been led to believe that a lot of dangers to the environment have gone away.
""I guess people believe that the problem is taken care of, because of recycling ,"" said Kelly Quirke, director of the Rainforest Action Network in San Francisco. Yet Quirke is hopeful that high-tech may also prove helpful. He says printers that print on both sides are growing in popularity.
The action group has also found acceptable paper made from materials other than wood, such as agricultural waste. 
 Question:Hewlett-Packard Co. has decided to develop new technologies because   _  . 
A. people are concerned about the environment 
B. printers in many offices are working overtime 
C. small companies need more hard copies 
D. they see a growing market for printers

Context: In 2007.five young people in the American state of Massachusetts developed an idea. The team knew that the world is filled with mobile phones.About eighty percent of all people are said to live within reach of a wireless telephone signal.    
    The idea was to use mobile phones and the Internet to connect job seekers with employers.The young people wrote a business plan and formed a company called Assured Labor.
    Assured Labor won a development competition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Three of the founders were graduate students there.    '
    Assured Labo is an electronic market place.It has two parts.One is for;the United States.That operation was launched in January in Boston.It links people with employees offering temporary jobs.
    The other arm of the business is for developing markets.That operation is meant to help people get mbfe permanent jobs.A representative is currently building partnerships with universities,and international companies in Central America.
    Assured Labor's president David Reich,says the companies now place job advertisements on radio or in newspapers.Some even drive around in cars with loudspeakers announcing that jobs are available.He says the companies are interested.in having more modem hiring practices.
    Through Assured Labor, companies will list open positions on the Internet.People who think
 they could do the job could reply by text messages or on their cellophanes.
    This is how the system works inprefix = st1 /Boston.
The jobs available include house cleaning.Dog walking and home repay. People who want their house cleaned,for example,can look online at a list of twenty housekeepers.The list tells what services.they offer,and how much they want to be paid.People need two letters praising their work to get on the list of service providers.
    The employer chooses workers they would like jot hire ,The company then sends the workers a text or e-mail message so they can respond quickly to an offer.
    After a job is completed,the employer and employee rate each other, The rating is kept for  future use.Assured Labor is not charging anyone,right now, but the plan is to have employers pay for the service.

Context: David hated spending money. When he had to buy something in a shop, he always tried his best to knock down the price, even for the cheapest things. If he wanted to buy a bottle of orange, for example, and the shopkeeper asked for $2, David would say, ""Make it $1.90 and I'll buy it."" Sometimes the shopkeepers agreed to _ their prices a little. ""What's ten cents?"" they asked themselves. ""If it makes this man happy, it won't hurt me very much."" In this way David saved a few cents here and a few cents there, and by the end of the year he had saved several hundred dollars.

""About two minutes,"" the dentist answered. ""Forty dollars for two minutes' work!"" he shouted, ""That's robbery  ."" The dentist smiled. ""You're right,"" she said. ""Thank you for telling me. I'll pull your tooth out very slowly. How about if I take half an hour?""

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B
Context: A U.S. dad quit his job, giving up a massive salary, after his 10-year-old daughter gave him a 22-point list outlining all the events he missed so far during the year. As the CEO of the $2 trillion global investment fund PIMCO, Mohamed El-Erian shocked the finance industry when he quit in January.
El-Erian said it was about a year ago when he was repeatedly asking his daughter to brush her teeth, but she wasn't listening. When he asked her why, she responded with a list of 22 milestones he had missed: like the first day of school and the first soccer game of the season.
""And the school year wasn't yet over,"" El-Erian wrote. ""I felt awful and got defensive: I had a good excuse for each missed event! Travel, important meetings, and urgent phone call, sudden to-dos. But it dawned on me that I was missing an infinitely more important point. My work-life balance had gotten out of whack, and the imbalance was hurting my very special relationship with my daughter. I was not making enough time for her."" El-Erian explained he was struggling with the same thing so many parents do--work-life balance.
Dads who are quitting their profit-making jobs to improve work-life balance is a subject that is getting more traction as some high-profile executive have recently written about their experiences.
Last month, former MongoDB CEO Max Schireson wrote a blog post for Time about his decision to step down from the company's top job. He wrote that he struggled to make time for his three children because he was flying around half a million kilometres a year for work.
""I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car, or when my son had an emergency surgery,"" Schireson wrote.
On an overnight flight to Texas he woke up in Arizona to discover the plane made an emergency landing and some traumatized crew members had to be replaced. He decided it was time to address his work-life balance.
Quitting is something El-Erian and Schireson were financially able to do, but El-Erian recognizes most people don't have this luxury. He hopes companies will pay attention to improving work-life balance for their employees.
El-Erian now manages ""a portfolio of part-time jobs"" that don't require as much travel. He alternates mornings with his wife taking their daughter to school and he often picks her up from school.
""So far, it's been the right decision for me,"" he wrote. ""I'm so grateful that this is providing me greater opportunity to experience key moments in my daughter's life before they're all too quickly gone."" 
 Question:El-Erian resigned from PIMCO mainly because   _  . 
A. his daughter has been missing him badly 
B. he was getting bored with the endless flights 
C. he hoped to get his daughter to listen to her 
D. he wanted to experience his daughter's milestones

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----. 
A. planted less corn 
B. planted morn crops 
C. planted morn wheat 
D. earned more money

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT."" 
 Question:The price of the knives was cut down by half because   _  . 
A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap 
D. the knives were produced in one factory

One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends ( ) for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said five cents each. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store., selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1000 stores in the US and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always run his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: "" The customer is always right.""

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns.

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----. 
A. planted less corn 
B. planted morn crops 
C. planted morn wheat 
D. earned more money

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.

A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.

A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

When he felt he was ready to start work, he discovered a flaw   . He had to begin his calculations all over again, or he might have made the stone useless. Six months passed, and Kaplan finally said to the owner, ""I am ready to start my work. There will be one excellent diamond that will be comparable one excellent diamond of first-class quality    "" Kaplan waited a few more days until he felt he was in the best physical and mental   condition  possible. He picked up his tools   and held his breath as he made the diamond exactly as he promised. 
 Question:When the diamond was resold,   _   . 
A. the dealer lost a lot of money 
B. Joker made some more money 
C. the dealer got 800, 000 dollars 
D. Kaplan got 800,000 dollars 
 Answer: C
Context: An environment group called the Food Commission is unhappy and disappointed because of the sales of bottled water from Japan. The water, it angrily argues in public, has traveled 10,000 "" _ "" before it reaches Western customers. ""Transporting water half-way across the world is surely the extremely stupid use of fuel when there is plenty of water in the UK."" It is also worried that we are wasting our fuel by buying prawns from Indonesia (7,000 food miles) and carrots from South Africa (5,900 food miles).
Counting the number of miles traveled by a product is a strange way of trying to tell the true situation of the environmental damage done by an industry. Most food is transported around the world on container ships that are extremely energy-efficient. It should be noted that a ton of butter transported 25 miles in a truck to a farmers' market does not necessarily use less fuel on its journey than a similar product transported hundreds of miles by sea, Besides, the idea of ""food miles"" ignores the amount of fuel used in the production. It is possible to cut down your food miles by buying tomatoes grown in Britain rather than those grown in Ghana; the difference is that the British ones will have been raised in heated greenhouses and the Ghanaian ones in the open sun.
What is the idea of ""food miles"" does provide, however, is the chance to cut out Third World countries from First World food markets. The number of miles traveled by our food should, as I see it, be regarded as a sign of the success of the global trade system, not a sign of damage to the environment. 
 Question:By comparing tomatoes raised in Britain and in Ghana, the author tries to explain that  _  . 
A. British tomatoes are healthier than Ghanaian ones 
B. Ghanaian tomatoes taste better than British ones 
C. cutting down food miles may not necessarily save fuel 
D. protecting the environment may cost a lot of money

Context: Eighth-grader Victoria Bills is talking about money with her classmates. She is worried that a company's stock   price could fall. It may be an unusual topic of conversation for a 13-year-old. But at Bills' school in Chicago, US, you hear it all the time.
The Chicago school's 420 students learn about economic . They also get a chance to make money. Each 1stgrade and 5thgrade, students learn the basics of economics and investing .
Then in 6thgrade, they put what they've learned to work. Students join a junior group that manages the $20,000. The group, made up of 12 to 14 students, decides which stocks to buy.
After graduating, students pass on $20,000 to the next 1stgrade class. They keep half of the rest of the money; the other half goes toward improving the school. They can choose to put their money in a college-savings program or take the cash.
In 2007, Bills suggested that her class buy the stock of the Apple computer company. This was just before the iPhone came out. ""We bought stock just at the right time,"" she says. The kids bought Google stock as it reached $400 a share. It is now worth over $500. ""It was a good buy,"" says Myles Gate, 13. He hopes to be a banker one day.
The school's two graduating classes of 2005 and 2006 have each earned about $10,000 in profits . 
 Question:Who manages the $20,000 in the class? 
A. The teachers. 
B. The school. 
C. The students. 
D. The parents. 
 Answer: C
Context: The addictive pull of Internet shopping is dragging thousands of victims into a rise of debt, including thousands of women who have run up huge credit card bills they cannot repay. 
The appeal of 24-hour access and the explosion in goods and services on offer has seen a 10 percent increase in credit card debts in the UK this year. 
Much of it has accounted for online spending. The latest report on Internet usage shows the number of adults logging on at home has risen from 10 million in October last year to 15.5m this month. 
The report by Continental Research, which has monitored Internet access in the UK for the past six years, found that while online shopping used to be experimental it is now becoming habitual, especially for women. 
Colin Shaddick, who heads the company, said, ""Women are logging on in record numbers ---online shopping has certainly played a big role in this."" The study found that average annual spending online is PS700 a year for each Internet shopper. 
The draw of the Internet is especially strong for collectors. Business lecturer Stephen Hall, who has been buying and selling books since he was a child, now has a collection worth PS40,000. 
He is passionate about the opportunities offered by shopping online. ""You can find a book in minutes that you could spend months hunting down at auctions or second-hand bookshops,"" he said. ""It can easily become addictive, and all the collectors I know use the Internet. I suspect you do waste money because you are less likely to send back a book to Little Rock, Arkansas, than take it back to the high-street shop.""
Like Stephen Hall, most of us can shop online sensibly---but for some it provides an easy, anonymous and accessible way to feed their habit. It also provides secrecy---a central part of any addiction. Dr Samantha Haslett, a psychologist and expert in addiction at the Promos counseling centre, said, ""It's compulsive in the same way as alcohol and gambling, and addicts find themselves completely unable to stop themselves, despite debt mounting and relationships breaking up. It's the thrill and the buzz of purchasing that ignores all the negative consequences.""
People laugh at shopping addictions, but it's the same as food overeating:bulimicsdon't eat nice stuff, or things that are good for them. Shopping addicts are the same: they'll buy things they don't need or want or like. What they're buying is of no importance compared to the thrill they get spending money and acquiring something new.
I've counseled people who have bought piles of bed linen and curtains and just left them piled up in the corner of the room. 
I have seen people's marriages ruined. There's something more damaging about Internet shopping too because it takes place in the home, so the trick and secrecy is that much closer to the partner who is being tricked. 
Tennis star Serena Williams this year admitted to kicking an Internet shopping addiction that saw her spending up to six hours a day online in an attempt to avoid being seen out in public.  ""Every day I was in my room and I was online,"" Williams said. ""I wasn't able to stop and I bought, bought, bought. I was just out of control.""
Confidence is also growing in online security. Danny Meadows-Klue, chairman of Interactive Advertising Bureau, the Internet commercial watchdog, said, ""Online card fraud is a drop in the ocean compared to total credit card fraud, but it is increasing. We want to increase consumer confidence by encouraging shoppers to take simple steps to protect themselves.""
But there are still barriers to online shopping, declares James Goudie, a consumer psychologist at North Umbria University. ""For certain items some people prefer to shop personally, for example to try on an item of clothing and feel the quality. Payment of delivery charges is also  _ ."" 
 Question:Which of the following do you think the author would most probably agree with? 
A. Shopping online has advanced the consumers' debt increase in a way. 
B. many items are piled up in the room corner because they are out of date. 
C. shopping addiction is harder to be removed than alcohol and gambling. 
D. paying by credit can account for the phenomenon of online shopping.

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----. 
A. planted less corn 
B. planted morn crops 
C. planted morn wheat 
D. earned more money

Context: For many years, environmental problems have been a major concern to people. Almost all things are related to the word ""Green"", say, green buildings. A green building means not only the colour of the paint. Also,it refers to environmentally friendly houses,factories and offices.
Green building means ""reducing the impact  of the building on the land"", Taryn Holowka of the US Green Building Council in Washington D.C.said. According to Holowka,buildings account for 65 percent of total US electricity use. 
But green buildings can reduce energy and water use. Also,the buildings are often located near public transportation such as buses and subways,so that people can drive their cars less.That could be good for the environment,because cars use lots of gas and give off pollution. Green buildings are often built on developed land,so that the buildings don't destroy forests.
Marty Dettling is the project manager for a building that put these ideas into action.The Solaire has been called the country's first green highrise building.  According to Dettling,""We've reduced our energy use by onethird and our water by 50 percent.""
The Solaire cuts energy in part by using solar power.""On the surface of the building we have solar panels which change the sun's energy into electricity,""Dettling explained.
The Solaire also has lights that automatically turn off when people leave the room. In addition,the building has lots of windows,allowing people to use the sun for light during the day.The Solaire cuts water by reusing it.
Not everyone is eager to move into a green building,however. Some people think that things like solar panels cost more money than more traditional energy source. Anyhow,Holowka said,""It is going to take off."" 
 Question:""A green building""most refers to a(n)  _  building according to the passage. 
A. not ripe or modern 
B. covering green color1 
C. environmentally friendly 
D. fresh or new

Context: ""Slow City"" -- a recently launched project focused on preserving the traditional quality of life enjoyed in some of Italy's smaller cities and towns. The project was born from the idea of the ""Slow Food"" movement -- started in Italy in the 1980s -- which promotes leisurely eating and the growing of local, healthy products to fight against the American fast-food style.
""The American urban model has invaded our cities, making Italian towns look the same. We want to stop this kind of globalization,"" says Paolo Saturnini, an Italian mayor.
The ""Slow City"" project plans to emphasize the rich, cultural, culinary  and artistic local traditions of each community.
Walking areas will be enlarged and squares and parks will be made greener with more plants. Car alarms and other noise that disturbs the peace will be banned, and ugly TV aerials , advertising posters, and signs will be taken down.
City councils will also insist on the use of recycling and renewable energy sources, and will also introduce ecological transport systems. Parking will be made stress-free by creating more public parking areas, and easily accessible walkways and bike lanes will cross the city. But in the ""Slow City"" way, all improvements will probably come about slowly.
Thirty-two Italian city councils, which joined the ""Slow City"" program, have decided to take further steps in this direction by increasing the numbers of traditional family-style eating establishments, reducing noise pollution, and concentrating on making their towns friendlier for people to live in.
Organic local produce will be promoted in all restaurants and genetically modified foods  will be banned. ""We can't stop large, fast-food chains from coming here, but we hope that people who come to our towns will not want to eat exactly the same hamburger they can eat in Melbourne, London or Paris, but want something genuine and different,"" said Saturnini. 
 Question:According to the passage, the ""Slow City"" project aims at   _  . 
A. preventing Italy from being affected by America 
B. beautifying the environment of small Italian cities and towns 
C. calling on Italians to enjoy stress-free life 
D. protecting the traditional Italian lifestyle

Context: Books, Films and Plays
The novelist's medium is the written word, one might almost say the printed word. Typically the novel is consumed by a silent, individual reader, who may be anywhere at the time. The paperback novel is still the cheapest, most portable and adaptable form of narrative entertainment. It is limited to a single channel of information---writing. The narrative can go, effortlessly, anywhere: into space, people's head, palaces, prisons and pyramids, without any consideration of cost or practical possibility. In determining the shape and content of his narrative, the writer is restricted by nothing except purely artistic criteria. The novelist keeps absolute control over his text until it is published and received by the audience. He may be advised by his editor to revise his text, but if the writer refused to meet this condition no one would be surprised. It is not unknown for a well-established novelist to deliver his or her manuscript  and expect the publisher to print it exactly as written.
However, not even the most well-established playwright or screenplay writer would submit a script and expect it to be performed without any rewriting. This is because plays and motion pictures are cooperative forms of narrative, using more than one channel of communication.
The production of a stage play involves, as well as the words of the author, the physical presence of the actors, their voices and gestures, the ""set"" and possibly music. Although the script is the essential basis of both stage play and film, it is a basis for subsequent revision negotiated between the writer and the other creative people involved. They are given ""approval"" of the choice of director and actors and have the right to attend rehearsals , during which period they may undertake more rewriting work. In the case of the screenplay, the writer may have little or no control over the final form of his work. Contracts for the production of plays protect the rights of authors in this respect.
In film or television work, on the other hand, the screenplay writer has no contractual right to this degree of consultation. While the script is going through its various drafts, the writer is in the driver's seat, although sometimes receiving criticism from the producer and the director. But once the production is under way, artistic control over the project tends to pass to the director. _ 
 Question:Which of the following statements is True according to the passage? 
A. Playwrights envy the simplicity of the novelist's work. 
B. Experience in the theatre improves the work of screenplay writers. 
C. Screenplay writers usually have the final say in how a TV drama will turn out. 
D. Playwrights are frequently involved in revising their work.

Context: The role of a newspaper is to present and comment on the news. It is vital for keeping people well-informed on current affairs. In most Western countries, journalists try to shape the ideas and opinions of their readers, since in Western countries all newspapers are independent of the government. Some newspaper owners support liberal ideas including economic policies that help poor people. Other owners want policies such as lower taxes for rich people and less money to be given to poor people. You can almost judge the political ideas of a person in the West by looking at the newspaper he reads.
All newspapers report national and international news. They give the facts but also provide opinions on controversial issues in the editorials and columns of opinion. The readers of the newspaper can also comment on these editorials or articles. There are many informative articles too as well as reviews of new films and books, etc. These are very important, for if a film or book gets good reviews it will often become more successful.
All these articles require many journalists who are experts in different areas of life. All these articles come together and are checked by the chief editor of the newspaper. When he or she has made a decision on the articles, the newspaper is prepared for printing. All this work means that the journalists must work together as a team because there is a lot of pressure when you work in a newspaper office. There are constant deadlines and articles have to be fitted round advertisements, photographs and much, much more. 
 Question:What articles comment on controversial issues? 
A. Editorials and opinion columns. 
B. News stories. 
C. Some of the informative articles. 
D. Jokes and humor.

You can almost judge the political ideas of a person in the West by looking at the newspaper he reads.
All newspapers report national and international news. They give the facts but also provide opinions on controversial issues in the editorials and columns of opinion. The readers of the newspaper can also comment on these editorials or articles. There are many informative articles too as well as reviews of new films and books, etc. These are very important, for if a film or book gets good reviews it will often become more successful.
All these articles require many journalists who are experts in different areas of life. All these articles come together and are checked by the chief editor of the newspaper. When he or she has made a decision on the articles, the newspaper is prepared for printing. All this work means that the journalists must work together as a team because there is a lot of pressure when you work in a newspaper office. There are constant deadlines and articles have to be fitted round advertisements, photographs and much, much more. 
 Question:Why are good reviews important to books? 
A. Good reviews are excellent introduction to books. 
B. Readers especially favor books with good reviews. 
C. Good reviews can make readers feel relaxed and comfortable. 
D. Good reviews can bring a large circulation of the books reviewed. 
 Answer: D
Context: One of the main challenges facing many countries is how to maintain their identity in the face of globalization and the growing multi-language trend. ""One of the main reasons for economic failure in many African countries is the fact that, with a few important exceptions, mother-tongue education is not practiced in any of the independent African states."" said Neville Alexander, Director of the Project for the Study of Alternative Education in South Africa at the University of Cape Town.
In response to the spread of English and the increased multi-language trends arising from immigration, many countries have introduced language laws in the laws in the last decade. In some, the use of languages other than the national language is banned in public spaces such as advertising posters. One of the first such legal provisions was the 1994 ""Toubon law"" in France, but the idea has been copied in many countries since then. Such efforts to govern language use are often dismissed as _ by language experts, who are well aware of the difficulty in controlling fashions in speech and know from research that language switching among bilinguals is a natural process.
It is especially difficult for native speakers of English to understand the desire to maintain the ""purity"" of a language by law. Since the time of Shakespeare, English has continually absorbed foreign words into its own language. English is one of the most mixed and rapidly changing languages in the world, but there has not been a barrier to acquiring prestige and power. Another reason for the failure of many native English speakers to understand the role of state regulation is that it has never been the Anglo-Saxon way of doing things. English has never had a state-controlled authority for the language, similar, for example, to the Academic Francaise in France.
The need to protect national languages is, for most western Europeans, a recent phenomenon--especially the need to ensure that English does not unnecessarily take over too many fields. Public communication, education and new modes of communication promoted by technology, may be key fields to defend. 
 Question:Why do many English-speaking countries not support the language protection efforts described in the passage? 
A. They think language protection laws are ineffective. 
B. They want their language to spread to other countries. 
C. They have a long history of taking words from other languages. 
D. It reduces a language's ability to acquire international importance.

Context: LONDON (AP) -- England joins on Sunday the growing list of places that ban smoking in public buildings, taxis and other places including even Buckingham Palace with a tough law.
Pubs, clubs and restaurants will all be smoke-free. Taxi and delivery drivers have been warned that they too could be fined 50 pounds, or about $100, if caught lighting up inside work vehicles.
Experts say the bans have become an irreversible   tread because of greatly rising health costs and public uneasiness over second-hand smoke. Some of the strictest smoking bans are in the United States, even though there is no federal anti-smoking policy. New York and Florida have strict bans, while California has certain outdoor smoking bans.
Spain, Italy, Iran, Norway, Sweden, Singapore, South Africa, Uruguay and new Zealand have passed legislation  to restrict smoking. France banned smoking in many public places in February and plans to extend the ban to cafes and restaurants next year. Finland is introducing a ban in 2009.
Despite the spread of bans, the World Health Organization predicts a steady rise in tobacco sales. In its Tobacco Atlas, the WHO said that by 2030 there will be ""at least another two billion smokers in the world"" and an expected decrease in male smokers ""will be _ by an increase in female smoking rates, especially in developing countries.""
In advance of the English ban, anti-smoking ads have coated bus stops and the British government has subsidized  programs to help people quit. The rest of Britain--Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland --already have smoking bans in place. 
 Question:Which of the following places may still be smoking areas in England? 
A. Private houses 
B. Taxis. 
C. Restaurants. 
D. London clubs 
 Answer: A
Context: Tobacco companies are fighting efforts in the United States and Australia to make their products less appealing. In Washington, a federal judge last week blocked the Food and Drug Administration from requiring new warning labels on cigarette packs. Judge Richard Leon ruled in a case brought by five tobacco companies. The judge temporarily stopped a new federal rule which requires large new warnings starting next September. These include color1 images such as a dead body or diseased lungs. And simple text warnings now appear.
Congress called for color1 images showing the dangers of smoking, similar to what Canada does. But the tobacco companies say the new requirements approved in June violate   their free speech rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Judge Leon said the FDA could not require the new labels before a lawsuit  against the government is decided. Some experts say the process could take years. The judge said he believed the cigarette makers were highly likely to win their case.
He said the images should be designed to appeal to emotions, rejecting government arguments that they should be purely factual. He accused the government of trying to use the labels to promote an ""obvious anti-smoking agenda?""
The head of an anti-smoking group, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the decision ""wrong on the science and wrong on the law"".
About one-fifth of American adults smoke. The World Health Organization says tobacco kills nearly six mil-lion people worldwide each year. More than six hundred thousand of them are non-smokers who breathe other people's tobacco smoke.
In Australia, tobacco companies want to stop what would be the world's most restrictive laws on cigarette advertising. Cigarettes could be sold only in plain olive-green packages. Only the brand name and health warnings could appear. The Senate passed the bill last week and sent it back to the Lower House to approve minor amendments  . The law is to go into effect in December of next year.
Tobacco companies Say the legislation   violates the Australian constitution. They say it would unjustly reduce the value of their brand names and trademarks. Health Minister Nicola Roxon says the government is ready for a legal fight. 
 Question:What are the tobacco companies ii1 the United States and Australia fighting against? 
A. The requirements to sell fewer products to the public. 
B. The requirements to print new warning labels on their products. 
C. The measures to make their products more attractive. 
D. The ways to make the companies close their business. 
 Answer: B
Context: A new weapon is on the way in the fight against smoking in Europe. Soon when smokers buy cigarettes they might see a shocking photo of a blackened lung or a cancer patient staring back at them from the packet.
Some boys may think of smoking as cool and sexy. Their friends won't agree when they see their packets of cigarettes lying on the table. The European Union announced on October 22, that it had chosen 42 photos that showed the damage cigarettes could do to the body. It called on member nations to put these pictures on packets to discourage smokers. To catch the attention of teenagers, the special packets warn of long-term medical dangers, like cancer. Short-term effects, like bad skin, are also on the list.
""The true face of smoking is disease, death and horror. That is the message we should send to the young,"" said David Byrne, an EU health official. ""Hopefully these pictures will shock students out of their love for cigarettes.""[:ZSSxxSSk.Com]
The EU head office hoped the pictures would work better than current written warnings on packs of cigarettes. The warnings included ""smoking kills"" and ""smoking can lead to a slow and painful death.""
So far, Ireland and Belgium have shown interest in the photos. Canada has used similar pictures and warnings on cigarette packs since 2000. The country has recently seen a fall in the number of smokers. According to studies, smoking is the single biggest cause of avoidable death in EU. Every year more than 650,000 smokers die, more than one person a minute. 
 Question:The pictures chosen by the EU are supposed to work on   _  . 
A. young smokers 
B. smokers in Ireland and Belgium 
C. all smokers 
D. young smokers' friends 
 Answer: A
Context: SYDNEY --- Tobacco companies will be forced to use plain, logo-free packaging on their cigarettes in order to make them less attractive to smokers under laws introduced Thursday by Australia's government.
The rules, which will take effect on 1 July 2012, will ban tobacco companies from including logos, promotional text or color1ful images on cigarette packages. A government health warning will be displayed instead, with the brand name at the bottom.
The government also announced it would raise the cigarette tax by 25 percent, driving up the price of a pack of 30 cigarettes by about A$2.16(PS1.30).
Tobacco companies immediately decided to fight it in court. ""Introducing plain packaging just takes away the ability of a consumer to identify our brand from another brand and  _ is of value to us,"" an Imperial Tobacco Australia spokeswoman, Cathie Keogh, told ABC, adding the company plans to take legal action. Retailers  said the tax increase would hurt their businesses and encourage the cigarette black market.
""It's a policy being pushed by some health advocates,"" said Mick Daly, the national chairman of Australian supermarket chain IGA. ""That is a direct attack on approximately 16 percent of Australians who have made legal lifestyle choices.""
Time Wilson, director of intellectual property  and free trade at Australia's Institute of Public Affairs, said tobacco companies were likely to demand compensation  over the forced packaging changes, which could cost taxpayers around A$3 billion a year.
""Under Australia's constitution, if the government basically takes someone's property rights, including intellectual property such as trademarks, they have to provide compensation,"" Wilson said. ""I'd be shocked if they didn't seek compensation, because if it happens here, it'll happen all over the world.""
Opposition leader Tony Abbott said he wanted evidence that changing the packaging would reduce smoking.
""I'm not in the business of defending smoking, I want to make that  ly clear. But I also want to make  ly clear that this is not a health policy - this is a tax grab ,"" Abbott said.
Australia has banned tobacco ads from print, television and radio for years. Internet advertising will also be forbidden. 
 Question:Abbott holds the view that the main purpose of the policy is to   _  . 
A. increase tax 
B. reduce smoking 
C. defend smoking 
D. improve general health

Context: Making a film takes a long time and is very hard work. Writing the story for the film may take many weeks. Shooting   the film often takes at least six months. Actors and camera men work from very early in the morning until late at night. Each scene has to be acted and re-acted, filmed and re-filmed, until it is just fine. Sometimes the same scene has to be acted many times.
The film studio is like a large factory, and the indoor stages are very big indeed. Scenery of all kinds is made in the studio. Churches, houses, and forests are all built of wood and cardboard. Several hundred people work together to make one film. Some of these people are the actors and actresses. The director of the film, however, is the most important person in a film studio. He decides how the scenes should be filmed and how the actors should act.
Most people go to see a film because they know the film stars are in it. Sometimes the film may be very poor. It is best to choose a film made by a good director. Some famous directors make their films very real; people feel that they themselves are among the people in the films. 
 Question:The best title for the passage is ""  _   "". 
A. Writing the Story 
B. Actors and Actresses 
C. A Director 
D. Making a Film

Context: Having driven almost thirty hours, I decided to stay in South Carolina for a few days. The next morning, I purchased a three-day fishing license and bait   before heading to the lake.
Opening my trunk, I carefully took out my fishing gear  , put it on the lake's edge, baited up and began to fish.
""Good morning,"" said someone, walking up from behind me.
Turning around, I saw a game warden   with a clip-board.
""Good morning,"" I said, nodding my head.
""Catch any fish?"" he asked.
""No sir, just relaxing and killing time.""
""Can I see your fishing license?""
I handed him the license I had purchased at the bait shop.
""Can I see your driver's license, too?"" he requested.
""I see the name on the driver's license is spelled Kiser and the name on the fishing license is Kaiser,"" said the warden.
""The gentleman at the bait shop must have written it wrong,"" I told him.
""Well, I'm afraid I'll have to write you up for fishing with an invalid license and take away your fishing gear.""
""You've got to be kidding,"" I responded, with a surprised look on my face.
Sure enough I was written up and my fishing gear taken away. I was told that I would have to pay a fine and that my stuff would be sold at auction .
I stood there almost in tears as he drove away. Those rods and reels were very special to me. I had used them over twenty years, fishing with my friends, who were now all dead.
After returning home in Georgia, I telephoned South Carolina trying to explain the situation, but no
one would listen. I was told that the Department of Fish and Game had a ""zero tolerance"" for fishing and hunting violations. Finally, in tears I paid the fine and gave up the fight.
Nine months later, I received a letter. I had no idea who it was from as there was no return address. On a plain piece of notebook paper was written ""Auction for the Department of Fish and Game held this Saturday at 11:00 am.""
On Saturday, at six in the morning I headed to South Carolina. By ten o'clock I had found the auction. There were numerous boats and piles upon piles of fishing equipment. All at once, there it was--my wonderful stuff all thrown in a pile as if it was worth nothing.
As the auction began I took my seat. In my wallet was twenty-seven dollars. For more than an hour I waited for my property to be brought to the auction block.
""We have three rods and reels here. I guess we will sell this as a unit,"" said the auctioneer.
""50 dollars,"" yelled someone in the crowd.
""51 dollars,"" yelled another man.
I rose from my seat and walked out of the auction.
""66 dollars,"" I heard as the bidding continued.
""100 dollars,"" came another bid. The auction became silent.
""100 dollars once, 100 dollars twice, 100 dollars three times. Sold for 100 dollars,"" went the auctioneer.
I walked to my truck, got in and just sat there. Suddenly I heard something hit the side of my truck. Turning around, I saw the back of a man putting my three rods and reels into my truck. It was the same game warden who wrote me the ticket almost a year ago!
As I got out of the truck he stuck out his hand and said, ""I wasn't wrong. _ ""
I shook his hand, thanked him and drove away. I cried as I crossed the South Carolina Georgia state line. 
 Question:Who wrote a letter to the writer telling him about the auction? 
A. The Department of Fish and Game. 
B. The game warden. 
C. A person unmentioned in the passage. 
D. The auction organizers. 
 Answer: B
Context: Once there was an 11-year-old boy who went fishing with his father in the middle of a New Hampshire lake. On the day before bass   season opened, they were fishing early in the evening, catching other fish with worms. Then the boy tied on a small silver lure   and put it into the lake. Suddenly he felt that something very big pulling on the lure. His father watched with admiration as the boy skillfully brought the fish beside the bank. Finally he lifted the tired fish from the water. It was the largest one he had ever seen, but it was a bass.
The boy and his father looked at the big fish. The father lit a match and looked at his watch. It was 10 p.m.--two hours before the season opened. He looked at the fish, then at the boy. ""You'll have to put it back, son,"" he said.
""Dad!"" cried the boy. ""There will be other fish,"" said his father. ""Not as big as this one,"" cried the boy. He looked around the lake. No other fishermen or boats were in sight in the moonlight. He looked again at his father.
Even though no one had seen them, nor could anyone ever know what time he had caught the fish, the boy could tell from his father's voice that the decision couldn't be changed. He threw the huge bass into the black water. The big fish disappeared. The boy thought that he would never again see such a big fish.
That was 34 years ago. Today the boy is a successful architect in New York City. He often takes his own son and daughters to fish at the same place.
And he was right. He has never again caught such a large fish as the one he got that night long ago. But he does see that same fish ... again and again ... every time he has an ethical   decision to make. For, as his father had taught him, ethics are simple matters of right and wrong. It is only the practice of ethics that is difficult. 
 Question:From the text we know that the father   _  . 
A. didn't love his son 
B. always disagreed with his son 
C. disliked the huge fish 
D. was firm and stubborn

Context: I will never forget the tenth summer of childhood with my grandfather in western Norway at the mountain farm where my mother was born. As a boy ,I always thought people simply bought whatever they need. Whether Grandfather knew this, I don't know. One day he said, ""Come, I have something for you.""
I followed him to a workroom. ""You should have a toy boat. You can sail it at Storvassdal."" He said. Great, I thought,looking around for the boat. But there was none.
Grandfather pointed to a block of wood. ""The boat is in there,"" he said. Then he handed me some tools and showed me how to use them properly. ""It'll be a fine boat,and you'll make it with your own hands,"" he said,""No one can give you what you do for yourself."" The words rang in my head as I worked. Finished the boat. It wasn't much to look at ,but I was poud. Then I sailed it at Storvassdal.
We had to return to America. ""You cannot bring that boat home with you,"" my mother said. We already had too much baggage. Feeling sad, I hid my boat under a big rock at Storvassdal.
I said good-bye to Grandfather, not knowing I would never see him again.
In 1964, I went to Storvassdal with my parents and my wife and children. To my surprise,for 34 years my treasure stayed here,waiting for my return. I felt _ were togethet again although my grandfather had died 22 years before.
I carved""1930""and""1964"" on its side and put it back.
I returned to the lake in 1968,1971,1977 and 1988. Each time I had the boat and carved the year,my grandfather seemed near.
My last trip to Storvassdal was in 1991. I brought my granddaughters: Catherine,13; Claire,12. I hoped they would understand the importance of the little boat and its simple message. At Storvassdal, Claire said softly, 'Grandpa,someday I'll come back.' She added,""And I'll bring my children."" 
 Question:What lesson did the writer's grandfather probably teach him? 
A. Boys should have a toy boat at childhood. 
B. People can simply buy whatever they need. 
C. Boys should learn to make a boat out of wood. 
D. No one can give you what you do for yourself. 
 Answer: D
Context: If you go to Finland, you'll be surprised to find how ""foolish"" the Finnish people are.
Take the taxi drivers for example. Taxis in Finland are mostly high class Benz with a fare   of two US dollars a kilometer. You can go anywhere in one, tell the driver to drop you at any place, say that you have some business to attend to, and then get off without paying your fare. And the driver would not show the least sign of worry.
The dining rooms in all big hotels not only serve their guests, but also outside diners. Hotel guests have their meals free, so their good faith is to wave their registration card to the waiter. With such a loose check, you can easily use any old registration card to take a couple of friends and dine free of charge.
With so many loopholes   in everyday life, surely Finland must be a heaven to those who love to take ""pretty advantages"". But the strange things is, all the taxi-passengers would always come back to pay their fare after they have attended to their business; not a single outsider has ever been found in the free hotel dining rooms. As the Finns always act on good faith and always show an attitude of ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" in everything they do, so to live in such a society has turned everyone into a real ""gentleman"". In a society of such high moral practice, what need is there for people to take precautions   against others? 
 Question:The sentences ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" show that   _  . 
A. the Finns are foolish 
B. the Finns take things seriously 
C. the Finns are busy making money for the family 
D. the Finns never take precaution against others 
 Answer: B
Context: One night when my wife was preparing dinner, our little son took a piece of paper to her which read:
For washing the car .........................................................$5.00
For making my own bed this week ....................................... $1.00
Going to the provision shop ................................................$0.50
Playing with little sister......................................................$0.25
Taking out the rubbish....................................................... $1.00
Getting a good report card................................................ ..$5.00
And for sweeping the common corridor................................... $2.00
Total........................................................................... $14.75
His mother looked at him standing there expecting payment. I could see a thousand memories flashed through her mind. So she picked up the pen and turning the paper over, this is what she wrote : 
For nine months I carried you, growing inside me .................. No Charge
For the nights I sat up with you, doctored and prayed for you......No Charge
For the toys, food and clothes and wiping your nose ................No Charge
When you add it all up, the full cost of my love.......................No Charge
Well, when he finished reading, he had big tears in his eyes. He looked at his mother and said, ""Mummy, I love you."" Then he took the pen and in great big letters wrote on the ""bill"" ""All paid."" 
 Question:The son wrote ""All Paid"" on the bill to show that   _  . 
A. he realized how much love he had got from his mother 
B. the mother paid all the money listed on the bill 
C. the father paid all the money 
D. he was very angry 
 Answer: A
Context: The Norwegian Government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down (though these have already been raised); and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the Government will be able to hold things back for long. As one Norwegian politician said last week: "" We will soon be changed beyond all recognition.""
Ever since the war, the Government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. During the past few years this program has had a great deal of success. Tromso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern policy could be in ruins.
The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 percent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad.
The real argument over oil is its threat to the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it, because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as essentially Norwegian. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most critical of the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the countryside and to the sea. 
 Question:According to the passage, the oil industry might lead northern Norway to   _  . 
A. the development of industry 
B. a growth in population 
C. the failure of the development program 
D. the development of new towns

Context: Most young people enjoy some form of physical activity. It may be walking, cycling, swimming or in winter, skating or skiing. It may be a game of some forms - football, basketball, hockey, golf of tennis. It may be mountaineering.
Those who have a  _ for climbing high and difficult mountains are often looked up with astonishment. Why are men and women willing to suffer cold and hardship, and to take risks in high mountains? This astonishment is caused, probably, by the difference between mountaineering and other forms of activity to which men give their leisure .
Mountaineering is a sport and not a game. There are no man - made rules, as there are for such games as golf and football. There are, of course, rules of different kind which it would be dangerous to ignore, but it is this freedom from man - made rules that makes mountaineering attractive to any people. Those who climb mountains are free to use their own methods, but the sport requires high mental and physical qualities.
A mountain climber continues to improve in skill year after year. A skier is probably past his best by the age of thirty, and most international tennis champions are in their early twenties. But it is not unusual for men of fifty or sixty to climb the highest mountains in the Alps. They may take more time than younger men, but they certainly experience equal enjoyment.

If we compare mountaineering with other more familiar sports, we might think that one big difference is that mountaineering is not a ""team game"". We should be mistaken in this. There are, it is true, no ""matches"" between ""teams"" of climbers, but when climbers are on a rock face linked by a rope on which their lives may depend, there is obviously teamwork.
The mountain climber knows that he may have to fight forces that are stronger and more powerful than man. He has to fight the forces of nature. His sport requires high mental and physical qualities.

Context: As China becomes increasingly urbanized  , it has to find space for its urban and rural citizens as both groups become increasingly integrated. Experts suggest a possible model way may be ""re-inventing"" a ""garden city"".
China's mega-cities are bursting at the borders and the country is now undergoing the quickest and biggest urbanization in the history of mankind. It is estimated that by 2025, China will have 400 million more people living in its cities, raising its urban population to 900 million. Besides, new satellite towns are mushrooming on the urban fringes while city ring roads are rippling outwards into the countryside at amazing speed. Satellite maps collected by Professor Joshua Bolchover at the University of Hong Kong bring the problem sharply into focus. They track the changing rural-urban framework in the past 30 years, and suggest that cities are cruelly destroying surrounding rural land and rapidly reducing the amount of arable   land, which gives way to new residential blocks, new industrial zones, new financial centers and the other inevitable signs and signatures of economic growth.
This, however, is not sustainable growth pattern, especially when China has the world's largest population to feed. So concerned urban planners are starting to note the social and physical effects of diaspora   when replaced rural communities are forced into the cities.
On the other hand, a trend of thought is gradually taking shape and this is the concept of the ""garden city"", a combination of country and city that is being proposed by architects and city planners. Hua Li, from Tao Architects, is among the many professionals with such a voice. His argument is supported by a long-term study on this subject. As Hua says, the answer is to preserve patches of productive farmland within urban boundaries. Less transportation means we have fresh agricultural products at lower costs and less carbon emission in the city. And urban farmland can also be showcased for agricultural tourism and education.
The concept is already practiced at the grassroot level. Agriculture has gone into the air, up to roof and balcony in some communities in the cities. It's common to see organic ""hanging garden"" on the roof of some traditional courtyard home. According to some people, the rooftop project translate to tangible (="" practical)"" benefits, such as safe, nutritious vegetables, a cooler home in summer. Some say thanks to the tomatoes they plant that are natural insect killers, there're fewer mosquitoes. Apart from these, it also contributes to better bonding with neighbors. Zhang, a doctor in Beijing, began creating his hanging garden five years ago. Since his garden became home to 30 kinds of vegetables and fruit --- all enough to feed his family, neighbors have enjoyed dropping by for a relaxing chat or just to see how well the lovely vegetables and fruit are doing.
Although people like Zhang are still rare and the greening of roof space with vegetables and fruit takes skill and energy, with more positive media exposure and advanced technology there is the prospect that garden city will become common practice in the near future. By then, cities will no longer look so gray when seen from the satellites. 
 Question:As for the concept of the ""garden city"", the writer feels   _  . 
A. desperate 
B. hopeful 
C. disappointed 
D. concerned

 Answer: C
Context: When Dawn Bonfield, the former chief executive of the Women's Engineering Society, ran a stand recently at a big military air show, she was in for a shock.
There were around 900 _ among the crowd and Ms Bonfield says, ""I'm saying to all these girls, 'Do you know about engineering, would you like to be an engineer, have you thought about engineering?' And in the whole day... probably five or six of them said yes. Every other one said no, just straight out no.""
What surprised her most, she says, is that it wasn't that these eight and nine-year-old girls didn't know what engineering was. Simply that they had already switched off. They had lost interest in engineering. ""So how much work does it take to change that?"" asks Ms Bonfield. ""I mean it's huge.""
There's no shortage of data to back up her estimation of the scale of work required. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show that women make up around just 8% of engineers in the UK. And this is at a time when the UK needs to produce thousands more engineers, so much so that the inventor, Sir James Dyson, is planning to open his own instituteto address the skills shortage.
Not enough female role models is well documented as a reason why girls don't choose engineering.
The attitude of parents was also an important factor in career choices. For girls, perhaps unsurprisingly, mothers were particularly influential.
""My mum was a bit iffy about it at first because she was more like, 'Girls should do this and that and the other,' more like 'keep your posture up and be ladylike',"" says middle school student Hannah. ""But my dad used to build a lot of stuff and he got me into that. So after my mum saw how me and my dad interacted she said, 'Yeah, go for it' and she's kind of the one who supported me with this."" 
 Question:Why did Hannh finally choose engineering? 
A. Because she found a woman role model. 
B. Because her mother was sure of her future. 
C. Because her father had influence on her. 
D. Because she wanted to meet the demand of society.

Context: The Attack on September 11th
New York: When the first jet struck Tower 1 at World Trade Center at 8: 48 am on Tuesday, the people in Tower 2 at World Trade Center with a view of the instant damage across the divide had the clearest sense of what they too must do : get out fast.
Katherine Ilachinski, who had been knocked off her chair by the blast of heat exploding from the neighboring tower, was one of those. Despite her 70 years of age, Ms Ilachinski, an architect working on the 91st floor of Tower 2 at World Trade Center, the south tower, went for the stairs. Twelve floors above her, Judy Wein, a manager, screamed and set off too.
But others up and down the 110 floors, many without clear views of the damage across the way and thus unclear about what was happening, were not so sure. And the 18 minutes before the next plane would hit were ticking off.
Among the uncertainty about what was the best thing to do, formal announcements inside the south tower instructed people to _ , assuring them that the building was sound and the threat was limited to the other tower.
Some left, others stayed, some began to climb down and, when met with more announcements and other warning to stop or return, went back up. The decisions made in those instants proved to be of great importance, because many who chose to stay, were doomed   when the second jet crashed into the south tower killing many and stranding (...) many more in the floors above where the jet hit.
One of those caught in indecision  was the manager at Fuji Bank USA. Richard Jacobs of Fuji Bank left the 79th floor with the other office workers, but on the 48th floor they heard the announcement that the situation was under control. Several got in the lifts and went back up two minutes or so before the plane crashed into their floor. 
 Question:Few people would have died if   _ 
A. more announcements had been made 
B. people hadn't used the lifts 
C. the incident had happened on a weekend 
D. people chose to stay

Context: Mark Twain has been called the inventor of the American novel. And he surely deserves additional praise: the man who popularized the clever literary attack on racism.
I say clever because anti-slavery fiction had been the important part of the literature in the years before the Civil War. H. B. Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin is only the most famous example. These early stories dealt directly with slavery. With minor exceptions, Twain planted his attacks on slavery and prejudice into tales that were on the surface about something else entirely. He drew his readers into the argument by drawing them into the story.
Again and again, in the postwar years, Twain seemed forced to deal with the challenge of race. Consider the most controversial, at least today, of Twain's novels, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Only a few books have been kicked off the shelves as often as Huckleberry Finn, Twain's most widely read tale. Once upon a time, people hated the book because it struck them as rude. Twain himself wrote that those who banned the book considered the novel ""trash and suitable only for the slums  ."" More recently the book has been attacked because of the character Jim, the escaped slave, and many occurences of the word nigger. (The term Nigger Jim, for which the novel is often severely criticized, never appears in it.)
But the attacks were and are silly--and miss the point. The novel is strongly anti-slavery. Jim's search through the slave states for the family from whom he has been forcibly parted is heroic. As J. Chadwick has pointed out, the character of Jim was a first in American fiction--a recognition that the slave had two personalities, ""the voice of survival within a white slave culture and the voice of the individual: Jim, the father and the man.""
There is much more. Twain's mystery novel Pudd'nhead Wilson stood as a challenge to the racial beliefs of even many of the liberals of his day. Written at a time when the accepted wisdom held Negroes to be inferior   to whites, especially in intelligence, Twain's tale centered in part around two babies switched at birth. A slave gave birth to her master's baby and, for fear that the child should be sold South, switched him for the master's baby by his wife. The slave's lightskinned child was taken to be white and grew up with both the attitudes and the education of the slave-holding class. The master's wife's baby was taken for black and grew up with the attitudes and intonations of the slave.
The point was difficult to miss: nurture  , not nature, was the key to social status. The features of the black man that provided the stuff of prejudice--manner of speech, for example-- were, to Twain, indicative of nothing other than the conditioning that slavery forced on its victims.
Twain's racial tone was not perfect. One is left uneasy, for example, by the lengthy passage in his autobiography   about how much he loved what were called ""nigger shows"" in his youth--mostly with white men performing in black-face--and his delight in getting his mother to laugh at them. Yet there is no reason to think Twain saw the shows as representing reality. His frequent attacks on slavery and prejudice suggest his keen awareness that _ did not.
Was Twain a racist? Asking the question in the 21st century is as wise as asking the same of Lincoln. If we read the words and attitudes of the past through the ""wisdom"" of the considered moral judgments of the present, we will find nothing but error. Lincoln, who believed the black man the inferior of the white, fought and won a war to free him. And Twain, raised in a slave state, briefly a soldier, and inventor of Jim, may have done more to anger the nation over racial injustice and awaken its collective conscience than any other novelist in the past century. 
 Question:What best proves Twain's anti-slavery stand according to the author? 
A. Jim's search for his family was described in detail. 
B. The slave's voice was first heard in American novels. 
C. Jim grew up into a man and a father in the white culture. 
D. Twain suspected that the slaves were less intelligent.

Context: Booker T. Washington was born in a black slave family in Virginia of the USA in 1856, seven years before slavery was abolished   by Abraham Lincoln in January, 1863.
He wrote a book about his life called Up From Slavery, which was published in 1901. In the book, he said that he had no choice but to work in a coal mine when he was 16 years old.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer

 Answer: C
Context: Tobacco companies are fighting efforts in the United States and Australia to make their products less appealing. In Washington, a federal judge last week blocked the Food and Drug Administration from requiring new warning labels on cigarette packs. Judge Richard Leon ruled in a case brought by five tobacco companies. The judge temporarily stopped a new federal rule which requires large new warnings starting next September. These include color1 images such as a dead body or diseased lungs. And simple text warnings now appear.
Congress called for color1 images showing the dangers of smoking, similar to what Canada does. But the tobacco companies say the new requirements approved in June violate   their free speech rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Judge Leon said the FDA could not require the new labels before a lawsuit  against the government is decided. Some experts say the process could take years. The judge said he believed the cigarette makers were highly likely to win their case.
He said the images should be designed to appeal to emotions, rejecting government arguments that they should be purely factual. He accused the government of trying to use the labels to promote an ""obvious anti-smoking agenda?""
The head of an anti-smoking group, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the decision ""wrong on the science and wrong on the law"".
About one-fifth of American adults smoke. The World Health Organization says tobacco kills nearly six mil-lion people worldwide each year. More than six hundred thousand of them are non-smokers who breathe other people's tobacco smoke.
In Australia, tobacco companies want to stop what would be the world's most restrictive laws on cigarette advertising. Cigarettes could be sold only in plain olive-green packages. Only the brand name and health warnings could appear. The Senate passed the bill last week and sent it back to the Lower House to approve minor amendments  . The law is to go into effect in December of next year.
Tobacco companies Say the legislation   violates the Australian constitution. They say it would unjustly reduce the value of their brand names and trademarks. Health Minister Nicola Roxon says the government is ready for a legal fight. 
 Question:What are the tobacco companies ii1 the United States and Australia fighting against? 
A. The requirements to sell fewer products to the public. 
B. The requirements to print new warning labels on their products. 
C. The measures to make their products more attractive. 
D. The ways to make the companies close their business.

Context: A new report shows what life might be like in 100 years from now. It describes skyscrapers that are much taller than today's buildings, underwater ""bubble"" cities and holidays in space. The report is from a company. It asked experts   on space and architecture, as well as city planners, to give their ideas on the life in 2116. They said the way we live, work and play will be totally different to how we do these things today. The experts used the Internet as an example. They said that 25 years ago, people could not imagine how the Internet and smartphones would change our lives. The Internet has completely changed the way we communicate, learn and do daily things. The experts said the changes in the next century would be even more unbelievable.
Researchers questioned 2,000 adults about the prediction   they thought were most likely   to happen in the future. They predicted that in the future, few people will go to an office but will work from home and have work meetings online. People will have highly developed 3-D printers that will let you download   a design for furniture or a food recipe and then ""print"" the sofa, table or pizza at home. There will also be less need for visits to the doctor. We will all have a home health instrument that will tell us what the problem is and give us treatment. We will also be going into space for holidays and to get resources that we have used up on Earth. A prediction that is missing is whether people will still need to study English.

How should we view the changes that wait for us in the future? Should we be optimistic about the years ahead, or worried about what the future holds? Some scientists and experts are having a discussion about how technology, science and society will develop in the future.
""I'm looking forward to the day when more technology will come to my life."" Says Hohn Searle, a professor at the University of California Berkeley Philosophy, ""because I think further research in such areas as genetics, physics, chemitry and medicine will help us to overcome poverty , improve health, and make life longer.""
Hugh Herr, at MIT's Biomechatronecs Group, considers very powerful weapons   as concern  over the future. Another is the growing role of technology in our lives. ""Machines taking over what humans do is not a good thing,"" Herr says.
That is a similar concern shared by Danisla Cerqui, a social and cultural scientist. ""I am afraid that the long-term future we are building will have no space left for human beings,""says Cerqui.

Context: John McCain and Barack Obama call for closer U.S.-Chinese cooperation on trade, the environment and nuclear proliferation  in the upcoming issue of an American business group's magazine. They do so in an unusual effort to  _ voters abroad.
Both articles appeared Sunday on the website of the American Chamber of Commerce  in China, and will be published in China Brief, the chamber's monthly magazine, on September 22.
Both stress that the countries should work more closely to ease trade friction , fight global warming, improve military exchanges, and block the spread of nuclear weapons to such countries as Iran and North Korea. 
""Cooperation on the key, enduring global challenges, such as climate change, can deepen understanding and enhance confidence. """"We also need to deepen high-level dialogues on a sustained basis on economic, security and global political issues"", said Obama in the article.
McCain agreed that the cooperation with prefix = st1 /Chinawould be essential in addressing issues of global concern. ""TheUnited Statesshares common interests withChinathat can form the basis of a strong partnership on issues of global concern, including climate change, trade and proliferation,"" he added.

Both candidates  were impressed by China's economic success.
""Chinahas achieved extraordinary, sustained growth over the past three decades. Hundreds of millions of people inChinalive better now than most thought possible even two decades ago,"" Obama said.
""China's double-digit growth rates have brought hundreds of millions out of poverty, energized the economies of its neighbors and produced many new economic opportunities,"" McCain said.

Context: More than a third of the babies born this year could receive a 100th birthday message from whoever happens to be on the throne in the second decade of the 22nd century, according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). It forecasts that 35% of the 826,000 people born in 2012 will live to become _ .
But a long life is not unalloyed good news. David Sinclair, head of policy and research at the International Longevity Centre UK, warned that for many the future may mean social isolation as they live longer than friends and members of their families.
""It is of course good news that so many more people are living longer,"" he said, ""but there is a big 'but1. We will be older, but in worse health, and at high risk of living alone. The other problem is that we are very poor at forward planning. We deal with the problems that are under our noses, but even problems two or three years away seem quite distant enough to put off.When you're talking about forecasts for a time half a century away and more, I see no evidence that we are putting in place the measures to deal with it.""
This year there will be 14,500 centenarians in the UK, a number which is expected to increase to 110,000 in 2035.

The estimated number of female centenarians has risen from 500 in 1961 to more than 10,000 in 2010,a figure which is projected to reach 71,000 by 2035 and 276,000 by 2060.
Men are also living far longer, although their numbers are far fewer. There were an estimated 92 male centenarians in 1961 and just below 2,000 in 2010. 
 Question:What does this passage mainly talk about? 
A. A long life is not always good news.

Context: Matt and his wife lived in the country. Matt was very mean and hated spending money. One day a fair came to the nearby town.
They went to the fair and looked at all the things to buy. Matt's wife wanted to buy a hat only costing $28, but was refused. Later on, a comb of $5 attracted her attention, but he would not let her spend any money.
Then, in a nearby field, they saw a small airplane. ""Fun flight!"" the notice said, ""$10 for 10 minutes.""
Matt had never been in an airplane and he wanted to go on a fun flight. However, he didn't want to pay for his wife either. ""I've only got $10,"" he told the pilot. ""Can my wife come with me for free?"" The pilot wasn't selling many tickets, so he said, ""I'll make a bargain with you. If your wife doesn't scream, she can have a free flight.""
Matt agreed, and got into the small airplane with his wife. The pilot took off and made his airplane do all kinds of things. At one moment it was flying upside down.

Context: The United States: Fliers may want to have their tickets in hand before catching their planes, but the airline companies are doing everything they can to bring forward cost-saving ticketless flight--no paper needed, just a ticket number and a photo ID. Anyone who buys a Northwest E-ticket through the airline's computer service by June 16 will get an award. Next time you fly, you can buy another ticket for a friend for $99, good anywhere in the US or Canada, along with the lowest ticket prices. Some airlines offer extra frequent-flier miles for the ticketless crowd. And there are rising punishments for paper lovers. American, Northwest, United, and US Airways have raised the cost for lost-ticket replacement to $70 from either $60 or $50. The airlines insist that the increase in price is not meant to push travelers toward E-tickets but only covers the increasing cost of replacing and tracking a missing ticket. 
 Question:Who are the paper lovers mentioned in the text? 
A. People who like to have paper airline tickets. 
B. People who love paper products of various kinds. 
C. People who travel with paper on a plane. 
D. People who have lost their ticket and buy a second one.

Locog and its ticket agent spent the Christmas period contacting ticket holders and offering them alternatives that included the tickets they had applied for but unsuccessful.The hanges need no additional cost.It has also offered to return any discrepancy   if the n ew tickets cost less than the originals.Locog said the replacement tickets would come from a number of unsold seats across the Olympic Games and  _ was doing all it could to make up the error to the fans who bought tickets.
Locog said the error occurred in the summer, between the first and second round of ticket sales, when a member of staff made a mistake, entering ""20,000"" into the computer rather than the correct figure of 10,000 remaining tickets.The error was discovered when Locog checked the number of tickets that had been sold against the final seating numbers, and began contacting ticket holders before Christmas.
Thousands of ticket holders have already struck lucky, changing to tickets for major events including swimming and athletics finals, and in around 200 cases the hottest of all, the men's 100m final.Locog said the decision to award 100m final tickets was made because one of the synchronised swimming competitions was on the same afternoon as the event, August 5. 
 Question:Which of the following is true according to the text? 
A. The synchronized swimming is the hottest of the Olympics. 
B. Thousands of ticket holders refused to change their tickets. 
C. The men's 100m final will take place on August 5, 2012. 
D. The number of tickets for synchronised swimming is 10,000. 
 Answer: C
Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----. 
A. planted less corn 
B. planted morn crops 
C. planted morn wheat 
D. earned more money 
 Answer: D
Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption 
 Answer: D
Context: An environment group called the Food Commission is unhappy and disappointed because of the sales of bottled water from Japan. The water, it angrily argues in public, has traveled 10,000 "" _ "" before it reaches Western customers. ""Transporting water half-way across the world is surely the extremely stupid use of fuel when there is plenty of water in the UK."" It is also worried that we are wasting our fuel by buying prawns from Indonesia (7,000 food miles) and carrots from South Africa (5,900 food miles).
Counting the number of miles traveled by a product is a strange way of trying to tell the true situation of the environmental damage done by an industry. Most food is transported around the world on container ships that are extremely energy-efficient. It should be noted that a ton of butter transported 25 miles in a truck to a farmers' market does not necessarily use less fuel on its journey than a similar product transported hundreds of miles by sea, Besides, the idea of ""food miles"" ignores the amount of fuel used in the production. It is possible to cut down your food miles by buying tomatoes grown in Britain rather than those grown in Ghana; the difference is that the British ones will have been raised in heated greenhouses and the Ghanaian ones in the open sun.
What is the idea of ""food miles"" does provide, however, is the chance to cut out Third World countries from First World food markets. The number of miles traveled by our food should, as I see it, be regarded as a sign of the success of the global trade system, not a sign of damage to the environment. 
 Question:From the passage we know that the author is most probably  _  . 
A. a supporter of free global trade 
B. a member of the Food Commission 
C. a supporter of First World food markets 
D. a member of an energy development group

Context: The role of a newspaper is to present and comment on the news. It is vital for keeping people well-informed on current affairs. In most Western countries, journalists try to shape the ideas and opinions of their readers, since in Western countries all newspapers are independent of the government. Some newspaper owners support liberal ideas including economic policies that help poor people. Other owners want policies such as lower taxes for rich people and less money to be given to poor people. You can almost judge the political ideas of a person in the West by looking at the newspaper he reads.
All newspapers report national and international news. They give the facts but also provide opinions on controversial issues in the editorials and columns of opinion. The readers of the newspaper can also comment on these editorials or articles. There are many informative articles too as well as reviews of new films and books, etc. These are very important, for if a film or book gets good reviews it will often become more successful.
All these articles require many journalists who are experts in different areas of life. All these articles come together and are checked by the chief editor of the newspaper. When he or she has made a decision on the articles, the newspaper is prepared for printing. All this work means that the journalists must work together as a team because there is a lot of pressure when you work in a newspaper office. There are constant deadlines and articles have to be fitted round advertisements, photographs and much, much more. 
 Question:What articles comment on controversial issues? 
A. Editorials and opinion columns. 
B. News stories. 
C. Some of the informative articles. 
D. Jokes and humor.

Context: When you buy a T-shirt, or a fur coat in a store, it often carries a label telling who made it or from what store it was bought. Instead, some labels show the dress is famous and it is very expensive, so buyers secretly wish they could be carried forever. On the other hand, buyers who deal with the cheapest products would be pleased to be away with labels  _ .
However, there is another label more important than the one showing from which store the dress was bought. When a person buys a fur coat, or a jacket from a store, a label telling what the product is made of should be carried to it.
The label is required by law. Besides telling what the product on show is made of, the label should be in clear English and be where one can find it easily. The information on the label must be true.
The reason for this is that most buyers today aren't expert enough to know exactly what kind of fur or material they are buying. The buyers must believe in the store that sells the products or in what the label says. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE? 
A. A T-shirt seldom carries a label. 
B. A fur coat with a high price often carries a false label. 
C. A label only says what material the product is made of. 
D. Not all buyers know the materials they are buying. 
 Answer: D
Context: Despite the anxiety that Jones'Host-said by some to be the first digital novel-caused in 1993,publishers weren't too concerned that e-books would one day replace printed books.However,that attitude was changed suddenly in 2007 when Amazon's Kindle came onto the market,which led to e-book sales jumping up to 1,260%.Since then,e-books'popularity has continued to steadily rise.The publishing industry seemed to have lost all possible ability to regain its position.Will printed books eventually become a thing of the past?
According to Mike Shatzkin,founder and CEO of the Idea Logical Company,printed books just for plain old reading will,in 10years from now,be unusual.""Not so unusual that a kid will say,'Mommy,what's that?'but unusual enough that on the train you'll see one or two people reading something printed,while everyone else is reading off of a tablet.""And Shatzkin believes that the demise of print is sure to happen,though such a day won't arrive for perhaps 50to 100or more years.
Robert Stein,founder of the Institute for the Future of the Book,however,believes that books won't disappear entirely,at least not anytime soon.""Print will exist,but it will be in a different field and will appeal to a very limited audience,as poetry does today.Like woodblock printing,hand-processed film and folk weaving  ,printed pages may assume an artistic value,""he says.He imagines that future forms of books might be developed not by conventional publishers but by the gaming industry.He also predicts that the distinction between writer and reader will be made less obvious by a social reading experience in which authors and consumers can digitally interact with each other to discuss any passage,sentence or line.
Is there anything we risk sacrificing,should print really disappear entirely?According to Maryanne Wolf,director of the Center for Reading and Language Research at Tufts University,electronic reading can negatively affect the way the brain responds to text,including reading comprehension,focus and the ability to maintain attention to details like plot and order of events.""My worry is that we'll have a short-circuited reading brain,excellent for gathering information but not necessarily for forming critical,analytical deep reading skills,""Wolf says.
The field,however,is in an early stage,and findings about the negative effects of e-reading are far from certain.In light of this,Wolf hopes that we continue to maintain a""bi-literate""society-one that values both the digital and printed word.""A full reading brain circuit is a huge contribution to the intellectual development of our species.Anything that threatens that deserves our attention.""

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation.

A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.

Context: A Samoan airline says that it is the world's first carrier to charge passengers by their weight. Samoa Air, which opened in 2012, asks passengers to give their personal weight during booking, which is then charged according to the length of a flight. The customers will also be weighed just before they board the plane.
""It is believed that all people throughout the world are the same size,"" Samoa Air CEO Chris Langton said. ""Airplanes always run on weight, not seats.""
""There is no doubt in my mind that this is the concept of the future. This is the fairest way of your travelling with your family or yourself.""
Though the airline introduced the plan last November, it caught people's attention last week when the carrier began international flights to neighboring American Samoa.
Almost at the same time, a Norwegian economist, Bharat Bhatta, published a report suggesting that airlines should charge obese passengers more.
The Pacific Islands contain some of the world's most common countries for obesity, many ranking in the top 10, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Samoa is ranked number four, with 59.6 percent of the population considered obese, said the most recent WHO report.
According to Samoa Air's latest schedule, the airline charges up to $0.57 per kg for flights in Samoa and $1.03 per kg for its only international flight to American Samoa, around 250 miles.
Children under 12 are charged 75 percent of the adult rate, with fares also based on weight. Any overweight baggage is calculated at the same rate as the passenger's personal weight.
The plan could actually prove cheaper in some cases, such as for families travelling with small children, and Langton said customer reaction has mainly been ""amazingly positive"".
The idea of charging passengers by weight has been hotly discussed before, and in the US some airlines require those who do not fit into a seat comfortably to buy a second seat. 
 Question:What does the text mainly tell us? 
A. 59.6% of Samoans are considered obese. 
B. Samoa Air introduces pay-by-weight pricing. 
C. Airlines should charge obese passengers more. 
D. Baggage must be calculated as passengers' weight.

Context: Many American women are earning money outside their homes today. Among women who are eighteen to sixty-four years old, more than fifty per cent have jobs.
    In general, working women have had more education then those who stay at home. Of those who work, thirty-two per cent have attended college, compared with twenty per cent of those who do not have jobs.
    Among women with jobs, eight out of ten drive a car to work, and eight per cent took a vacation a way from home during the past year. Much of their traveling was by air.
    These figures come from a report which was written for advertisers. The report gives advertisers a new picture of women today. For instance, it tells advertisers that fifty-one per cent of all American women have traveled by air--along with fifty-nine per cent of all American men.
    The lesson for American business is that many women now have other interests in addition to their homes. They like advertisements which show women in office, planes, and cars. 
 Question:The selection offers the least practical help to   _  . 
A. personnel managers, who hire new employees 
B. advertising agencies responsible for encouraging people to buy

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B
Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees 
 Answer: C
Context: A U.S. dad quit his job, giving up a massive salary, after his 10-year-old daughter gave him a 22-point list outlining all the events he missed so far during the year. As the CEO of the $2 trillion global investment fund PIMCO, Mohamed El-Erian shocked the finance industry when he quit in January.
El-Erian said it was about a year ago when he was repeatedly asking his daughter to brush her teeth, but she wasn't listening. When he asked her why, she responded with a list of 22 milestones he had missed: like the first day of school and the first soccer game of the season.
""And the school year wasn't yet over,"" El-Erian wrote. ""I felt awful and got defensive: I had a good excuse for each missed event! Travel, important meetings, and urgent phone call, sudden to-dos. But it dawned on me that I was missing an infinitely more important point. My work-life balance had gotten out of whack, and the imbalance was hurting my very special relationship with my daughter. I was not making enough time for her."" El-Erian explained he was struggling with the same thing so many parents do--work-life balance.
Dads who are quitting their profit-making jobs to improve work-life balance is a subject that is getting more traction as some high-profile executive have recently written about their experiences.
Last month, former MongoDB CEO Max Schireson wrote a blog post for Time about his decision to step down from the company's top job. He wrote that he struggled to make time for his three children because he was flying around half a million kilometres a year for work.
""I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car, or when my son had an emergency surgery,"" Schireson wrote.
On an overnight flight to Texas he woke up in Arizona to discover the plane made an emergency landing and some traumatized crew members had to be replaced. He decided it was time to address his work-life balance.
Quitting is something El-Erian and Schireson were financially able to do, but El-Erian recognizes most people don't have this luxury. He hopes companies will pay attention to improving work-life balance for their employees.
El-Erian now manages ""a portfolio of part-time jobs"" that don't require as much travel. He alternates mornings with his wife taking their daughter to school and he often picks her up from school.
""So far, it's been the right decision for me,"" he wrote. ""I'm so grateful that this is providing me greater opportunity to experience key moments in my daughter's life before they're all too quickly gone."" 
 Question:El-Erian resigned from PIMCO mainly because   _  . 
A. his daughter has been missing him badly 
B. he was getting bored with the endless flights 
C. he hoped to get his daughter to listen to her 
D. he wanted to experience his daughter's milestones 
 Answer: D

Context: Scores of people queued up to use a cash machine after it started giving out double the money requested.
The cash machine, outside a Sainsbury's store in Barham Road, Hull, attracted a big crowd of people hoping to take advantage of the fault, on Tuesday night. Police officers were eventually sent in to guard the machine and prevent anymore money from being withdrawn. The fault is thought to have affected cash machines at supermarkets across the city. It is not yet known whether the customers will have to repay the cash or how much money was taken out.
A spokeswoman for Humberside Police said, ""Officers were sent to the cash machine to prevent anyone else from withdrawing anymore money. We have also tried to make contact with the owners of the machine."" The spokeswoman said those who benefited from the fault could be traced and could face theft charges, but investigations would only take place if the operator made a complaint.
The cash machine is owned by a company called Payzone, a spokesman later confirmed. He said the fault was due to the machine being filled with notes of the wrong denomination . An investigation is underway into the incident and the machine had been taken out of service, he added.
The Payzone spokesman said, ""The transit company which is contracted to service this ATM has filled it up with the wrong denomination of notes, meaning it is paying out double what it should have. "" He could not say how much money had been taken out of the machine, or whether it would have to be paid back. It was understood that a number of cash machines in Hull owned by other companies had also been affected by this problem, he added. 
 Question:Who caused the cash machine not to work properly? 
A. The people who withdrew money. 
B. The transit company. 
C. The operator of the cash machine. 
D. The company Payzone.

Context: Spending as little as $5 a day on someone else could significantly boost happiness, the team at the University of British Columbia and Harvard Business School found on Thursday.
Their experiments on more than 630 Americans showed they were measurably happier when they spent money on others--even if they thought spending the money on themselves would make them happier.
""We wanted to test our theory that how people spend their money is at least as important as how much money they earn,"" said Elizabeth Dunn, a psychologist at the University of British Columbia. They asked their 600 volunteers first to rate their general happiness, report their annual (yearly) income and detail their monthly spending including bills, gifts for themselves, girls for others and donations to charity.
""Regardless of how much income each person made, those who spent money on others reported greater happiness, while those who spent more on themselves did not,"" Dunn said in a statement.
Dunn's team also surveyed 16 employees at a company in Boston before and after they received an annual profit-sharing bonus of between $3,000 and $8,000. ""Employees who devoted more of their bonus to pro-social spending experienced greater happiness after receiving the bonus and the manner in which they spent that bonus was a more important predictor of their happiness than the size of the bonus itself"" they wrote in their report, published in the journal Science.
They gave their volunteers $5 or $20 and half got clear instructions on how to spend it. Those who spent the money on someone or something else reported feeling happier about it.
""These findings suggest that very minor alterations (changes) in spending allocations (shares)--as little as $5--may be enough to produce real gains in happiness on a given day,""Dunn said. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the passage? 
A. Those who spend more money on others can get much more bonus. 
B. People usually think spending money on themselves will make them happier. 
C. Very small changes in spending your money may be enough to gain happiness. 
D. Researchers think that how people spend their money is at least as important as how much money they earn. 
 Answer: A
Context: BC Social Report, August 14, 2010
Scandinavians may spend a lot of the winter in darkness but they are the happiest people in Europe, according to a study showed this month. Countries like Denmark and Finland scored highest on the study of happiness in Europe carried out by Cambridge University, which also found that the sunny southern countries of Italy, Portugal and Greece got the least joy out of  life.
The survey entitled:  ""No Man is an Island"" showed that countries where people enjoy time with friends and family, have trust in government and national institutions were more likely to be happy than those living in a sunny climate. The study rated respondent on their overall sense of happiness and life satisfaction on a _ of one to 10.
Danes  --who expressed a high level of trust in their politicians and public institutions--came top of the field at 8.3. Italians--who reported lower levels of satisfaction with their national quality of government--came last at 6.49.' ""Italy, Greece, Portugal, Germany and France report the lowest levels of happiness while the Scandinavian Countries, Netherlands and Luxembourg report the highest,"" the study said.
Although Europeans are generally four times wealthier than their fathers and grandfathers, their levels of happiness are either equal to or lower than 40 years ago. The study also looked at factors contributing to happiness within countries and surprisingly found that an interest in politics actually increased happiness.
Lead researcher Luisa Corrado said tax cuts and throwing money at social problems appeared to have no effect on the happiness of citizens when compared with government policies which strengthened and supported wider social networks.  ""People are less naive ( ) than one would expect, politicians need to adapted their policies and target specific problems in specific areas,"" she said. 
 Question:In what column may readers probably read the passage?

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair.

A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.

 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help.

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----. 
A. planted less corn 
B. planted morn crops 
C. planted morn wheat

Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption 
 Answer: D
Context: As Apple tries to maintain its growth and success in China, the world's largest smart-phone market is becoming even more critical. Apple's shares  fell sharply as the company's earnings for the holiday quarter through December disappointed investors.
The sales of the iPhone, which include both the iPhone 5 and older models, came in at the low end of analysts' expectations, while the company's income plan for the second quarter was below analysts' forecasts, though Apple is known to give conservative   forecasts.
Som'6 analysts have said that for Apple to regain its growth, the company.needs a more aggressive strategy for markets, or more specifically for China, where the market for smart phones has been expanding more rapidly than anywhere else. In China, demand is particularly great for inexpensive phones that run on Android  operating system, sold by many Chinese phone makers as well as South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.
But Apple says it's already enjoying strong growth in China. ""We saw big growth in iPhones,""Chief Executive Tim Cook said. He said that the company has been quickly expanding its sales channels in China, including the number of Apple stores. ""This isn't nearly what we need, we're not even close to that, but we're making great progress. "" he said.
In China, a big missing piece for Apple is China Mobile Ltd. , the biggest local telecom carrier that doesn't yet sell the iPhone. Earlier this month, Mr. Cook met China Mobile Chairman Xi Guohua in Beijing and discussed cooperation, stirring hopes that the world's largest mobile carrier may soon start offering the iPhone.
Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is working on a lower-end iPhone that could launch as early as this year. But one possible challenge for Apple in China is that low-pricod Android-based phones are getting better in terms of quality. A report from CLSA in late November showed that many smart-phones sold at about 1,000 yuan ( $160) came with higher-reso-lution screens, better cameras and more powerful processors than phones at that price did a year earlier. 
 Question:What can we learn from the passage? 
A. Apple tends to offer a lower sales forecast. 
B. China Mobile Ltd began to team up with Apple. 
C. Cook is pessimistic about what Apple did in China. 
D. Apple didn't take measures to develop Chinese market.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT."" 
 Question:The price of the knives was cut down by half because   _  . 
A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap 
D. the knives were produced in one factory

The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle.

Context: Frank Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York., in 1852. His family were very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for showing goods to attract people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends ( ) for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said five cents each. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store., selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful.

Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.

Context: John and Bobby joined the same company together just after graduation from college the same year. Both worked very hard. After several years, however, the boss promoted   Bobby to the position of manager but John remained an ordinary worker. John couldn't
it anymore, gave his resignation   to the boss and complained that the boss only promoted those who only said good words to him.
The boss knew John worked very hard for the years. He thought for a moment and said, ""I hope you will do one more thing for our company before you leave.""
John agreed.  The boss asked him to go and find anyone selling watermelons in the market. John went and returned soon. He said he had found a man selling water melons. The boss asked how much they per kilo. John shook his head and went back to the seller to ask and returned to tell the boss $1.2 per kilo.
The boss told John to wait a second, and he called Bobby to come to his office. He asked Bobby to go and find anyone selling watermelons in the market.  Bobby went, returned and said, ""Boss, only one person is selling watermelons.  $1.2 per kg, and $10 for 10 kg. He has 340 melons in all, 58 of which are on the table. Every melon weighs about 2 kg. Brought from the South two days ago, they are fresh and red. ""
John was impressed and realized the difference between himself and Bobby. He decided not to resign but to learn from Bobby.

 Answer: C
Context: On March 5, 2009, Michael Jackson stood in front of crowds of fans. Before screaming fans, he pronounced with pumping arms: ""This is it!""
A few months later, Jackson was dead. With the late pop star's return to radio, television and the cultural events, Forbes judges that Jackson has made $90 million since his death June 25. This figure is based on his royalties  from album sales, radio play, rights to his name and royalties from his stock in the Sony/ATV music catalog  .
Jackson's music was his most easily-seen source in the last months. ""Nothing increases the value of an artist than death ... an untimely death,"" says Barry Massarsky, a music industry economist.
The music's immediate value was clear. Since June, Jackson has sold more than 5.9 million albums in the U.S. and another 4.5 million overseas. In the first weeks after his death, there were 5.6 million single downloads across North America, Europe and Australia. Jackson recently has three of the top 20 best-selling albums of the year in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan. His 2003 hits album Number Ones is the best seller of the year, beating Taylor Swift's Fearless.
More than 500,000 Jackson ringtones and 100,000 music videos were sold. In the week following his death, songs by The Jackson 5, The Jacksons and Michael were played over 100,000 times on the radio, according to Nielsen BDS.
Jackson's estate will likely see more money by the end of this year, as it has rights to some of the profits from This Is It as well as the two-disc album of the same name. The estate will share 90% of the film profits with AEG.
Ticket sales from an exhibit opening in London will also contribute a likely profit. Hundreds of Jackson's personal belongings-his L.A. Rolls Royce etc-will remain on show for three months at the O2 for fans willing to shell out $25 for a view.
The pop singer bought ATV Publishing, for $47.5 million in 1985. Ten years later, he sold the catalog to Sony for $95 million and took a 50% stock in Sony/ATV, which is now worth about $1.7 to $2 billion. So he still owned half the Sony/ATV catalog at his death.
Jackson's future earning potential is based on his stock in valuable music and as well as the value of his image . As many musicians, actors and artists before him, Jackson's fame could have a long tail on the market with allowable products, advertising and entertainment events. 
 Question:All the following is true EXCEPT that   _  . 
A. Rolls Royce is now for show and will finally be sold 
B. Jackson has sold 10.4 million albums since June 
C. Jackson's L. 
D. Jackson's stock in music and his image will keep on earning money in the future

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B
Context: The organization representing British universities has expressed concern about the potential effect of tuition fees after figures showed a drop of more than 6% in student applications with less than a month to go before the deadline for 2013 applications.
Data from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) showed there were 265,784 university applications by UK-based candiates up to 17 Decemeber, 6.3% down on the parallel period in the admissions cycle the year before. While this is less than the 8.4% year-on-uear fall seen in earlier Ucas figures, released in mid-November, the coming January deadline makes it ever more likely that the total 2013 applicant figure will see a second sizeable fall following the introduction of annual fees of up to PS9,000.
Nicola Dandridge, the chairman of Universities UK, said : ""However, we must be concerned about any drops in the numbers applying to university and in particular, we must look closely at how the increase in graduate contributions in England may be affecting the decisions of promising students. However ,the December figures show a drop in numbers across the UK, suggesting that it is not only a question of tuition fees in England putting off from applying.""
A report of the Uncas figures to mid-December shows a 6.5% fall for applicants in England and 11.7% for those in Wales, with smaller drops of 3.9% for Scotland and 0.5% for Nortern Ireland. Scotiish students at home insitiutions pay on fees, while those from Nothern Ireland have fees capped to PS3,575 for Northern Irish universities.
Dandridge added: ""No one should be put off applying to university because of worries about finance.""
""It is important that no one is put off applying to university because they do not have information about the student support available to them. Most new students don't need to pay directly. There will be more financial support for those from poorer families and everyone will make lower loan repayments thatn they do now once they are in well paid jobs."" 
 Question:Compared with the previous year, the fall in student applications is  _  . 
A. 3.9% 
B. 6% 
C. 6.3% 
D. 8.4% 
 Answer: C
Context: It is ""one of the few bright spots in the Chinese economy,"" says Zeng Ming. He is talking about e-commerce. Mr Zeng, the chief strategy officer for Alibaba, a giant Chinese Internet firm, predicts that digital transactions on his firm's platforms will top l trillion yuan ($159 billion) this year-more than Amazon's and eBay's combined. That is a bold claim, but consider what happened on Singles Sunday.
Invented a few years ago by students and seized upon by digital marketers, this festival for lonely hearts falls annually on the  llth day of the llth month (since l is the loneliest number).It is like St Valentine's Day, only worse. Singletons shower each other with tender gifts: a barrage of pearls; a storm of sweets.
This November llth they spent a surprising 19 billion yuan on Alibaba's online platforms-a fourfold increase on a year ago, and more than double what Americans spent online last Cyber Monday (the Monday after Thanksgiving, when retailers urge Americans to shop online). About 100m purchases were logged, accounting for 80% of the packages shipped that day. Couriers  were buried in parcels.
So life is good for China's e-tailers, then? Not exactly. The number of digital marketers is increasing and online sales are booming. Consumers are enjoying lower prices, better service and more variety. The problem? The pressure on profits in Chinese e-commerce is worse than in America, reckons Elinor Leung of CLSA, a broker. ""Almost no one makes money,"" she says.
The fiercest battles are being fought between online retailers and their bricks-and-mortar  rivals.Dangdang, a firm. that resembles Amazon,.and 360buy, another online retailer, have cut prices fiercely. Tencent, a cash-rich online giant known for its instant-messaging software, is splashing out to win market share. 360buy has also just raised $400m from investors to do the same. But it is unclear how much longer such firms can burn through capital.

Context: While success is surely sweeter than failure, it seems failure is a far better teacher, and organizations that fail spectacularly often flourish more in the long run, according to a new study by Vinit Desai, assistant professor of management at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. Researchers have found that people missing their goals perform much better in the long run. That is because they gain more knowledge from their failures than their successes and the lessons are more likely to stay longer in their minds.
""We found that the knowledge gained from success was often fleeting while knowledge from failure stuck around for years,"" said professor Desai, who led the study. ""But companies often ignore failure. Managers may fire people or turn over the whole workforce while they should treat the failure as a learning opportunity.""
Prof Desai compared the flights of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Challenger. During the 2002 Atlantis flight, a piece of insulation   broke off and damaged the left solid rocket booster   but didn't influence the program. There was little investigation. The Challenger was launched next and another piece of insulation broke off. This time the shuttle and its seven-person crew were destroyed. The disaster led to a major investigation resulting in 29 changes to prevent future disasters.
The difference in response in the two cases came down to this: Atlantis was considered a success and the Challenger a failure.
""Despite crowded skies, airlines are extremely reliable,"" he said. ""The number of failures is extremely small. And past researches have shown that older airlines, those with more experience in failure, have a lower number of accidents.""
Prof Desai doesn't recommend finding out failure in order to learn. Instead, he advises organizations to analyze small failures to collect useful information rather than wait for major failures. 
 Question:Fewer accidents happen to older airlines in that   _  . 
A. their planes couldn't fly high in the sky 
B. they gained much from experience in failure 
C. their planes were often checked by the experts 
D. they were unpopular among passengers 
 Answer: B
Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B
Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption 
 Answer: D
Context: As Apple tries to maintain its growth and success in China, the world's largest smart-phone market is becoming even more critical. Apple's shares  fell sharply as the company's earnings for the holiday quarter through December disappointed investors.
The sales of the iPhone, which include both the iPhone 5 and older models, came in at the low end of analysts' expectations, while the company's income plan for the second quarter was below analysts' forecasts, though Apple is known to give conservative   forecasts.
Som'6 analysts have said that for Apple to regain its growth, the company.needs a more aggressive strategy for markets, or more specifically for China, where the market for smart phones has been expanding more rapidly than anywhere else. In China, demand is particularly great for inexpensive phones that run on Android  operating system, sold by many Chinese phone makers as well as South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.
But Apple says it's already enjoying strong growth in China. ""We saw big growth in iPhones,""Chief Executive Tim Cook said. He said that the company has been quickly expanding its sales channels in China, including the number of Apple stores. ""This isn't nearly what we need, we're not even close to that, but we're making great progress. "" he said.
In China, a big missing piece for Apple is China Mobile Ltd. , the biggest local telecom carrier that doesn't yet sell the iPhone. Earlier this month, Mr. Cook met China Mobile Chairman Xi Guohua in Beijing and discussed cooperation, stirring hopes that the world's largest mobile carrier may soon start offering the iPhone.
Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is working on a lower-end iPhone that could launch as early as this year. But one possible challenge for Apple in China is that low-pricod Android-based phones are getting better in terms of quality. A report from CLSA in late November showed that many smart-phones sold at about 1,000 yuan ( $160) came with higher-reso-lution screens, better cameras and more powerful processors than phones at that price did a year earlier. 
 Question:What can we learn from the passage? 
A. Apple tends to offer a lower sales forecast. 
B. China Mobile Ltd began to team up with Apple. 
C. Cook is pessimistic about what Apple did in China. 
D. Apple didn't take measures to develop Chinese market.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees 
 Answer: C
Context: A British company has proposed releasing genetically modified(GM)   diamondback moths, which would reduce the population of the vegetable-eating insects. Males carrying a deadly gene would be released, which would cause their young ones to die immediately. Then the fall in their numbers could help increase production for farmers.
Oxitec, the company which came up with the idea, hopes to begin trials  next year, but some groups are saying no to them,, saying the untested technology could threaten wildlife and human health.
""Mass releases of GM insects into the British countryside would be impossible to recall if anything went wrong. Changing one part of an ecosystem  can have knock-on-effects on others in ways that are poorly understood. This could include an increase in different types of pests. Wildlife that feeds on insects could be impaired if there are changes to their food supply,"" said Dr Helen Wallace, the director of Gene-Watch UK.
Hadyn Parry, Oxitec's chief executive, said that there was demand from farmers for the technology and that using GM insects to kill the pests that feed on food crops is better for the environment than chemical sprays. The firm is developing a number of GM insects that would be used in Britain and around the world to protect crops and fight disease in humans.
Oxitec has contacted the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to ask what controls should be put in place around GM moth trials. A spokesman said that while its officials and advisers have discussed Oxitec's plans, there has not been a formal application for a trial. As a result, the department has not reached a view on whether it should go ahead. 
 Question:According to Hadyn Parry, what is farmers' attitude towards the technology? 
A. They are afraid to use it. 
B. They don't care about it. 
C. They support the use of it. 
D. They don't think it will work.

Context: College graduation brings both the satisfaction of academic achievement and the expectation of a well-paid job. But for 6,000 graduates at prefix = st1 /San JoseStatethis year, there's uncertainty as they enter one of the worst job markets in decades. Ryan Stewart has a freshly-minted  degree in religious studies, but no job prospects.
""You look at everybody's parents and neighbors, and they're getting laid off and don't have jobs,"" said Stewart, ""then you look at the young people just coming into the workforce... it's just scary.""
When the class of 2003 entered college, the future never looked brighter. But in the four years they've been here, the world outside has changed greatly.
""Those were the exciting times, lots of  _ opportunities, exploding offers, students getting top dollar with lots of benefits,"" said Cheryl Allmen-Vinnidge of theSan JoseStateCareerCenter. ""Times have changed. It's a mew market.""
Cheryl Allmen-Vinnidge ought to know. She runs the San JoseStateCareerCenter, sort of a crossroad between college and the real world. Allmen-Vinnidge says students who do find jobs after college have done their homework.
""The typical graduate who does have a job offer started working on it two years ago. They've postured  themselves well during the summer. They've had several internships "", she said. And they've majored in one of the few fields that are still hot, like chemical engineering, accounting, or nursing, where average starting salaries  have actually increased over last year. Other popular fields have seen big declines in starting salaries.
Ryan Stewart may just end up going back to school. ""I'd like to teach college some day and that requires more schooling, which would be great in a bad economy,"" he said. 
To some students, a degree may not be a ticket to instant wealth. For now, they can only hope its value will increase overtime. 
 Question:Ryan Stewart is probably going to   _  . 
A. get a teaching job 
B. become a religious leader 
C. change his major 
D. go back to school

Context: During Nelson Mandela's 19 years in the prison on Robben Island, one particular commanding officer, Badenhorst, was the cruelest of them all:
""A few days before Badenhorst's leaving the prison, I was called to the main office. General Steyn was visiting the island and wanted to know if we had any complaints. Badenhorst was there as I went through a list of demands. When I had finished, Badenhorst spoke to me directly.
He told me he would be leaving the island and added: 'I just want to wish you people good luck'. I do not know if I looked dumbfounded  , but I was amazed. He spoke these words like a human being and showed a side of himself we had never seen before. I thanked him for his good wishes and wished him good luck too.
I thought about this moment for a long time afterwards. Badenhorst had perhaps been the most cold-blooded and cruelest commanding officer we had had on Robben Island. But that day in the office, he had showed that there was another side to his nature, a side that had been hidden but still existed.
It was obvious that all men, even the most seemingly cold-blooded, have a heart of kindness and that, if their hearts are touched, they are able to change. Actually, Badenhorst was not evil; his inhumanity   had been encouraged by an inhuman system. He behaved cruelly because he was rewarded for cruel behavior."" 
 Question:Why did Badenhorst become the cruelest according to Mandela? 
A. He was born evil. 
B. He seemed cold-blooded. 
C. He was easily changed. 
D. His cruelty was rewarded. 
 Answer: D
Context: No one likes to make mistakes. But a new study says organizations learn more from their failures than from their successes, and keep that knowledge longer.
One of the researchers was Vinit Desai, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. He worked with Peter Madsen from the Marriott School of Management at Brigham Young University in Utah.
They did not find much long-term ""organizational learning"" from success. It is possible, they say. But Professor Desai says they found that knowledge gained from failure lasts for years. He says organizations should treat failures as a learning opportunity and not try to ignore them.
The study looked at companies and organizations that launch satellites--and other space vehicles. Professor Desai compared two shuttle flights.
In two thousand two, a piece of insulating  material broke off during launch and damaged a rocket on the Atlantis. Still, the flight was considered a success.
Then, in early two thousand three, a piece of insulation struck the Columbia during launch. This time, the shuttle broke apart on re-entry and the seven crew members died. NASA officials suspended all flights and an investigation led to suggested changes.
Professor Desai says the search for solutions after a failure can make leaders more open-minded. He points to airlines as an example of an industry that has learned from failures in the past.
He advises organizations to look for useful information in small failures and failures they avoided. He also urges leaders to encourage the open sharing of information. The study appeared in the Academy of Management Journal.
The mistakes we learn from do not have to be our own. We recently asked people on our Facebook page to tell us a time they had done something really silly.
Fabricio Cmino wrote: Not long ago I wanted to watch TV, but it wouldn't turn on, so I did everything I could to start it. Thirty minutes later my mum showed up and, passing by, said to me ""Did you try plugging it'? I'm just dusting, Mum!""So she wouldn't notice how dumb I am sometimes!
Bruno Kanieski da Silva told about a time he looked everywhere for his key. It was in hispocket. He wrote: I always promise I will never do it again, but after-a few weeks,where is mywallet? For sure it will be in a very logical place. 
 Question:Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? 
A. Only organizations can learn from mistakes 
B. We can also learn from failures that have been avoided. 
C. Lessons from the shuttle flights are more important. 
D. Leaders often lack an open mind and seldom share information. 
 Answer: B
Context: While success is surely sweeter than failure, it seems failure is a far better teacher, and organizations that fail spectacularly often flourish more in the long run, according to a new study by Vinit Desai, assistant professor of management at the University of Colorado Denver Business School. Researchers have found that people missing their goals perform much better in the long run. That is because they gain more knowledge from their failures than their successes and the lessons are more likely to stay longer in their minds.
""We found that the knowledge gained from success was often fleeting while knowledge from failure stuck around for years,"" said professor Desai, who led the study. ""But companies often ignore failure. Managers may fire people or turn over the whole workforce while they should treat the failure as a learning opportunity.""
Prof Desai compared the flights of the space shuttle Atlantis and the Challenger. During the 2002 Atlantis flight, a piece of insulation   broke off and damaged the left solid rocket booster   but didn't influence the program. There was little investigation. The Challenger was launched next and another piece of insulation broke off. This time the shuttle and its seven-person crew were destroyed. The disaster led to a major investigation resulting in 29 changes to prevent future disasters.

Prof Desai doesn't recommend finding out failure in order to learn. Instead, he advises organizations to analyze small failures to collect useful information rather than wait for major failures. 
 Question:Fewer accidents happen to older airlines in that   _  .

Context: Nate suffered a devastating blow when he lost his job. His boss had spoken rudely, ""Your services are no longer needed."" Nate left the building filled with despair . By the time he reached home, he was in a deep depression. When he entered his house, he blurted  out to his wife Sophia, ""I lost my job. I am a complete, utter failure."" A tense silence  followed. Then a smile crept  across Sophia's face. ""What great news!"" she responded. ""Now you can write the book you have always wanted to write.""""But I have no job and no prospect (hope) of a job,"" he objected  , completely without hope . ""If I struggle to be an author, then what will we live on? Where will the money come from?"" Sophia took her husband by the hand and led him to the kitchen, opening a drawer; she took out a box that was full of cash . ""Where on earth did you get this?"" Nate gasped. ""To whom does it belong?""
""It's ours!"" Sophia replied . ""I always knew that one day you would become a great writer if only you were given the chance. From the money you gave me for housekeeping every week, I have saved as much as I could so you would have your chance. Now there is enough to last us a whole year.""
What a surprise! What encouragement! What a wife! The unemployed  husband did concentrate on writing that year, and the novel he wrote became a literary masterpiece . The book is The Scarlet Letter. Sophia had an even greater achievement, and she turned Nathaniel Hawthorne from a poor clerk  into a world famous master.

Context: London has a new magazine.However,it is not printed on paper any more.Everyone who has a television can receive it because it is already on TV!
    In order to read this magazine,you need to have a decoder.Each page of it is numbered,so you have to dial a number to choose which subject you want to read about.You have a wide choice of topics to choose from-everything from cooking to the latest news.
    If you want to read some news,the first thing you have to do is to check at the index page which has an easy-to-remember page number,1 00 for example.From page 100,you can then choose from the news articles on page 101 to 109.From here,you will have to key in the numbers again.Then,the news will appear written across your screen.If you want to go out in the afternoon,you can press 181,and a brightly color1ed weather map will appear on the screen.But if you want to buy some cheap things,you can press 162 for a list of the week's best bargains.And whether you should drive or just take the train,you can simply press 189 for the traffic report.This new magazine on TV is very simple to use.But probably,the best thing about the service is that is being updated all the time.Journalists type new materials directly onto screen and the page of the magazine is replaced in minutes.
    London already has three services.One,transmitted by ITV ,is called ORACLE while the other two,on BBC,are called CEEFAX because they let you see facts.Although CEEFAX and ORACLE have been operating for some time, they have not been well publicized.BBC engineers do not think that their idea will ever replace books and newspapers because this new invention can't be taken with you wherever you go.But many people would agree that this is a breakthrough as great as the invention of printing, which could change not only our reading habits but also our lifestyles. 
 Question:Which is the best title of the passage? 
A. How to Read a Magazine 
B. A New Magazine 
C. An Invention of Printing 
D. Magazines in London

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle.

Context: Eighth-grader Victoria Bills is talking about money with her classmates. She is worried that a company's stock   price could fall. It may be an unusual topic of conversation for a 13-year-old. But at Bills' school in Chicago, US, you hear it all the time.
The Chicago school's 420 students learn about economic . They also get a chance to make money. Each 1stgrade and 5thgrade, students learn the basics of economics and investing .
Then in 6thgrade, they put what they've learned to work. Students join a junior group that manages the $20,000. The group, made up of 12 to 14 students, decides which stocks to buy.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: The organization representing British universities has expressed concern about the potential effect of tuition fees after figures showed a drop of more than 6% in student applications with less than a month to go before the deadline for 2013 applications.
Data from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) showed there were 265,784 university applications by UK-based candiates up to 17 Decemeber, 6.3% down on the parallel period in the admissions cycle the year before. While this is less than the 8.4% year-on-uear fall seen in earlier Ucas figures, released in mid-November, the coming January deadline makes it ever more likely that the total 2013 applicant figure will see a second sizeable fall following the introduction of annual fees of up to PS9,000.
Nicola Dandridge, the chairman of Universities UK, said : ""However, we must be concerned about any drops in the numbers applying to university and in particular, we must look closely at how the increase in graduate contributions in England may be affecting the decisions of promising students. However ,the December figures show a drop in numbers across the UK, suggesting that it is not only a question of tuition fees in England putting off from applying.""
A report of the Uncas figures to mid-December shows a 6.5% fall for applicants in England and 11.7% for those in Wales, with smaller drops of 3.9% for Scotland and 0.5% for Nortern Ireland. Scotiish students at home insitiutions pay on fees, while those from Nothern Ireland have fees capped to PS3,575 for Northern Irish universities.
Dandridge added: ""No one should be put off applying to university because of worries about finance.""
""It is important that no one is put off applying to university because they do not have information about the student support available to them. Most new students don't need to pay directly. There will be more financial support for those from poorer families and everyone will make lower loan repayments thatn they do now once they are in well paid jobs."" 
 Question:Compared with the previous year, the fall in student applications is  _  . 
A. 3.9% 
B. 6% 
C. 6.3% 
D. 8.4% 
 Answer: C
Context: Sirs,
 Your twelve thousand 'Smart' watches were received by our company this morning. However, we wish to make a number of complaints concerning the serious delay in delivery and your failure to carry out our instructions regard to this order.
It was firmly pointed out from the beginning that the delivery date had to be less than six weeks from the original order in order to satisfy our own customers' requirements. While we understand that delays in production are occasionally unavoidable, we must point out that the major reason why the order was placed with your company was that we were assured by you of its simplicity, and that your existing stocks were sufficiently high to ensure immediate shipment. Late delivery of the goods has caused us to disappoint several of our most valued customers, and will have an unfavorable effect on future orders.
The second complaint concerns the difference in colour between the watches we ordered and those delivered. It was stated clearly in the order that watches in combinations of green/purple and orange/purple only were required. However, only half the watches in the delivery received are of the colours specified. Our Hong Kong agent informed you of the importance of following our instructions exactly, since we consider there to be only a limited market in this country for watches of other color1s at the present time. Any watches that are not of the specified colours will, of course, be returned to you.
We are also somewhat concerned about the rather poor quality of the goods received, since it is obvious that the watches that finally arrived have been made from not good enough materials and have been produced to a lower standard than those in the sample. We have also found that a number of the watches do not appear to be working. Whether the latter problem is due to poor production, or damage in transportation is not yet clear, but we should like to point out that we feel this matter to be entirely your fault.
As a result of the above problems, therefore, we feel that the most suitable course of action is to return to you unpaid any of the goods considered unsatisfactory. We shall also, of course, be forced to reconsider whether any further orders should be placed with your company.
We look forward to your early reply.
Yours sincerely,
John Smith

Context: Sparrow is a fast-food chain with 200 restaurants. Some years ago, the group to which Sparrow belonged was taken over by another company. Although Sparrow showed no sign of declining, the chain was generally in an unhealthy state. With more and more fast-food concepts reaching the market, the Sparrow menu had to struggle for attention. And to make matters worse, its new owner had no plans to give it the funds it required.
Sparrow failed to grow for another two years. Until a new CEO, Carl Pearson, decided to build up its market share. He did a survey, which showed that consumers who already used Sparrow restaurants were extremely positive about the chain, while customers of other fast-food chains were unwilling to turn away from them. Sparrow had to develop a new promotional campaign.
Pearson faced a battle over the future of the Sparrow brand. The chain's owner now favored rebranding Sparrow as Marcy's restaurants. Pearson resisted, arguing for an advertising campaign designed to convince customers that visits to Sparrow restaurants were fun. Such an attempt to establish a positive relationship between a company and the general public was unusual for that time. Pearson strongly believed that numbers were the key to success, rather than customers' speeding power. Finally, the owner accepted his idea.
The campaign itself changed the traditional advertising style of the fast-food industry. The TV ads of Sparrow focused on entertainment and featured original songs performed by a variety of stars. Instead of showing the superiority of a specific product, the intention was to put Sparrow in the hearts of potential customers.
Pearson also made other decisions which he believed would contribute to the new Sparrow image. For example, he offered to lower the rent of any restaurants which achieved a certain increase in their turnover   .
These efforts paid off, and Sparrow soon became one of the most successful fast-food chains in the regions where it operated. 
 Question:What was Pearson's achievement as a CEO? 
A. He managed to pay off Sparrow's debts. 
B. He made Sparrow much more competitive 
C. He helped Sparrow take over a company 
D. He improved the welfare of Sparrow employees

Context: There are stock markets   in large cities in many countries. Stock markets in Paris,
London, Tokyo, Shanghai and New York are among the largest and most well-known. The stock, also called stock exchange,  is a place where people can buy or sell shares of a factory or  company. And each share means certain ownership  of a factory or company.

have. Others are not very rich, who buy stocks to try to become rich. Still others buy stocks as
part of their plan to save money.

do badly. Then the stocks will go down, and the investors will lose money. The stock may go up or down for a number of untold reasons. Everyone wants the stock to go up, but sometimes even if a factory or company does a good job, the stock may still go down.
Going to the stock market is often like gambling  . All want to make money by
""gambling' in the stock market. Factories and companies that need money are pleased that so many people are ready to ""gamble"". Indeed, the stock market is an attractive  but
part of the business world.

Context: It is a matter of common observation that although money income keeps going up over the years, we never seem to become richer. Prices are rising continuously. This condition is what we call inflation: the money supply is becoming inflated so that each unit of it becomes less valuable. We have got used to higher and higher rates of inflation in recent years. What could be bought twenty years ago for one pound now costs well over 2 pounds. And at present this rate of inflation seems to be rising rather than falling. If in the real world our money incomes go up at the same rate as prices do. One might think that inflation doesn't matter. _ When money is losing value it also loses one of the qualities of a good money--stability of value. It is no longer acceptable as a store of value; and it becomes an unsuitable means of delayed payment. Nobody wants to hold a wasting possession, so people try to get rid of money as quickly as possible. Inflation therefore simply stimulates our spending and discourages saving. 
 Question:.We can conclude according to the passage that   _  . 
A. the writer is a government official 
B. the writer is worried about inflation 
C. the writer encourages people to spend money 
D. the writer has become richer because of inflation 
 Answer: B
Context: The price of milk may be going up. There was not enough rain in some parts of the country last year and the bad weather may mean that a gallon   of milk will cost 41 cents more after October 1st.
California already has high milk prices and the California court does not want the price to go any higher. High milk prices will be very hard for some people. Families with many children will have to spend more money to buy milk. The poor and older people without much money will also be hurt by higher prices.
The court said that more milk from other states should be sold in California as the price of milk from other states is not as high. Some states got enough rain so their costs did not go up. People will then be able to buy the cheaper milk, meaning that unless milk producers bring their milk prices down, their milk will not sell.
The drought   around the country has meant market forces are likely to push milk prices up by as much as 41-cent a gallon by October 1st. Experts said this decision by the Californian court could reduce   the effect of the price rise here.
The 41-cent increase would add to California's already high milk prices so California must allow more milk producers from outside the state to sell their products there. This would then lead to increased supplies  , which would, as a result, stop milk prices from increasing. 
 Question:What will California do to keep milk prices down? 
A. Force milk producers to lower their price. 
B. Encourage people to drink less milk. 
C. Get men to produce more rain. 
D. Increase the supply of milk in the state.

Context: New research finds a link between poverty and poor decision making. The findings may explain why poor people sometimes make bad choices that continue their hardship.
     Earlier studies have found the poor less likely to escape poverty. But there has been little research on why the poor make decisions that make their lives harder. Until recently, it was economists who studied poverty, not psychologists. Eldar Shafir, a psychologist in Princeton University says now scientists from both fields work together. Mr. Shafir and his team did two experiments. One took place at a shopping center in New Jersey.  Another was carried out among sugar cane farmers in rural India.
      The New Jersey experiment involved individuals with low paying jobs and others belonged to the middle class. All the volunteers were asked what they would do if their cars needed repairs.
     The volunteers were given two imaginary situations. In the first, the car repairs cost $ 150.  In the second,  $ 1,500.
     ""And what we found is that the poor and the rich performed equally well on almost all the tests. ""
      Not so when the researchers raised the repair costs to $ 1,500.
     ""Now the poor performed significantly worse. "" The poorer lost about 13 IQ points on average. This is about the loss experienced when a person has not slept for one night.
     The scientists then wondered if the same person reacted differently when he was rich and when he was poor. The Indian sugar cane farmers earn most of their money once a year, when the harvest comes in. But the money often does not last through the year.
    ""So they find themselves basically rich after the harvest when the income comes in and poor just before the harvest.
     The researchers gave them tests similar to the ones taken by the people in New Jersey. They tested the Indian farmers before the harvest and after.
     And the results were much the same as with the mall shoppers.
     ""They performed much more slowly and with many more mistakes when they were poorer than when they were richer. ""
     Mr. Shafir says the results support 50 years of research that shows all humans have limited mental power to deal with things in life.
     ""And so the insight here is that, having not enough of something in a way makes it harder to make good decisions for everything else. "" 
 Question:What could be the best title for the passage?_(    ) 
A. Once poor, always poor? 
B. Why are poor people poorer? 
C. Poverty weakens brain power. 
D. Different experiments, different findings.

Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption 
 Answer: D
Context: Eighth-grader Victoria Bills is talking about money with her classmates. She is worried that a company's stock   price could fall. It may be an unusual topic of conversation for a 13-year-old. But at Bills' school in Chicago, US, you hear it all the time.
The Chicago school's 420 students learn about economic . They also get a chance to make money. Each 1stgrade and 5thgrade, students learn the basics of economics and investing .
Then in 6thgrade, they put what they've learned to work. Students join a junior group that manages the $20,000. The group, made up of 12 to 14 students, decides which stocks to buy.
After graduating, students pass on $20,000 to the next 1stgrade class. They keep half of the rest of the money; the other half goes toward improving the school. They can choose to put their money in a college-savings program or take the cash.
In 2007, Bills suggested that her class buy the stock of the Apple computer company. This was just before the iPhone came out. ""We bought stock just at the right time,"" she says. The kids bought Google stock as it reached $400 a share. It is now worth over $500. ""It was a good buy,"" says Myles Gate, 13. He hopes to be a banker one day.
The school's two graduating classes of 2005 and 2006 have each earned about $10,000 in profits . 
 Question:Who manages the $20,000 in the class? 
A. The teachers. 
B. The school. 
C. The students.

 Answer: C
Context: As Apple tries to maintain its growth and success in China, the world's largest smart-phone market is becoming even more critical. Apple's shares  fell sharply as the company's earnings for the holiday quarter through December disappointed investors.
The sales of the iPhone, which include both the iPhone 5 and older models, came in at the low end of analysts' expectations, while the company's income plan for the second quarter was below analysts' forecasts, though Apple is known to give conservative   forecasts.
Som'6 analysts have said that for Apple to regain its growth, the company.needs a more aggressive strategy for markets, or more specifically for China, where the market for smart phones has been expanding more rapidly than anywhere else. In China, demand is particularly great for inexpensive phones that run on Android  operating system, sold by many Chinese phone makers as well as South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.
But Apple says it's already enjoying strong growth in China. ""We saw big growth in iPhones,""Chief Executive Tim Cook said. He said that the company has been quickly expanding its sales channels in China, including the number of Apple stores. ""This isn't nearly what we need, we're not even close to that, but we're making great progress. "" he said.
In China, a big missing piece for Apple is China Mobile Ltd. , the biggest local telecom carrier that doesn't yet sell the iPhone. Earlier this month, Mr. Cook met China Mobile Chairman Xi Guohua in Beijing and discussed cooperation, stirring hopes that the world's largest mobile carrier may soon start offering the iPhone.
Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is working on a lower-end iPhone that could launch as early as this year. But one possible challenge for Apple in China is that low-pricod Android-based phones are getting better in terms of quality. A report from CLSA in late November showed that many smart-phones sold at about 1,000 yuan ( $160) came with higher-reso-lution screens, better cameras and more powerful processors than phones at that price did a year earlier. 
 Question:What can we learn from the passage? 
A. Apple tends to offer a lower sales forecast. 
B. China Mobile Ltd began to team up with Apple. 
C. Cook is pessimistic about what Apple did in China. 
D. Apple didn't take measures to develop Chinese market.

Context: According to a recent study performed by the Office of Applied Science, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, every day about 3,900 children and teens under the age of 18 try their first cigarette . Among the teens who continue to smoke into their adult years, about one out of three will die as a result of the habit.
Because of the nicotine content in tobacco products, smoking not only becomes a habit for teens, but an addiction . The nicotine in the tobacco is addictive. Once a teen develops the habit of smoking, it is difficult for them to quit without help. The American Lung Association reports smokers who start early in life find it more difficult to quit because of the addiction. 
Teens that smoke often do as a way of dealing with social situations or as a result of pressure from people of their age. The results of a Duke University study show teens with brothers and sisters who smoke are more likely to engage in smoking and other risky actions. The components  of tobacco products have documented  effects on behavior. Nicotine is known to increase fights in teens and adults.
The center for Young Women's Health at the Children's Hospital of Boston states that tobacco products contain about 4,000 chemicals, some of which are poisonous. Breathing these poisons into the lungs quickly affects a teen's entire body. Outward changes include dry, wrinkled skin, yellow teeth and nails, and bad breath. Teen smokers are three times more likely to have bad teeth than non-smokers of their age, the Center further reports. External  effects are often present soon after smoking becomes a habit. 
 Question:What makes people addicted to smoking according to the passage? 
A. The pressure from life. 
B. The feeling of being relaxed. 
C. The good smell of cigarettes. 
D. The nicotine in cigarettes.

Context: Tobacco companies are fighting efforts in the United States and Australia to make their products less appealing. In Washington, a federal judge last week blocked the Food and Drug Administration from requiring new warning labels on cigarette packs. Judge Richard Leon ruled in a case brought by five tobacco companies. The judge temporarily stopped a new federal rule which requires large new warnings starting next September. These include color1 images such as a dead body or diseased lungs. And simple text warnings now appear.
Congress called for color1 images showing the dangers of smoking, similar to what Canada does. But the tobacco companies say the new requirements approved in June violate   their free speech rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Judge Leon said the FDA could not require the new labels before a lawsuit  against the government is decided. Some experts say the process could take years. The judge said he believed the cigarette makers were highly likely to win their case.
He said the images should be designed to appeal to emotions, rejecting government arguments that they should be purely factual. He accused the government of trying to use the labels to promote an ""obvious anti-smoking agenda?""
The head of an anti-smoking group, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the decision ""wrong on the science and wrong on the law"".
About one-fifth of American adults smoke. The World Health Organization says tobacco kills nearly six mil-lion people worldwide each year. More than six hundred thousand of them are non-smokers who breathe other people's tobacco smoke.
In Australia, tobacco companies want to stop what would be the world's most restrictive laws on cigarette advertising. Cigarettes could be sold only in plain olive-green packages. Only the brand name and health warnings could appear. The Senate passed the bill last week and sent it back to the Lower House to approve minor amendments  . The law is to go into effect in December of next year.
Tobacco companies Say the legislation   violates the Australian constitution. They say it would unjustly reduce the value of their brand names and trademarks. Health Minister Nicola Roxon says the government is ready for a legal fight. 
 Question:What are the tobacco companies ii1 the United States and Australia fighting against? 
A. The requirements to sell fewer products to the public. 
B. The requirements to print new warning labels on their products. 
C. The measures to make their products more attractive. 
D. The ways to make the companies close their business. 
 Answer: B
Context: The poorer mental function seen among alcoholics, many of whom also regularly smoke cigarettes, may be partly caused by the long-term effects of nicotine , new study suggests. 
""People who are also smokers are more dangerous,"" Dr. Jennifer M. Glass, of the University of Michigan's Addiction Research Center, said. In her study, ""cigarette smoking had bad effects on IQ and thinking,"" she said. This finding may seem wrong because many smokers feel better after smoking. 
Studies show that up to 87 percent of alcoholics smoke cigarettes. Yet, few studies have looked into cigarette smoking as a reason that might explain the cognitive deficits  reported among alcoholics. 
To find out that connection, Glass and her partners examined brain function among 172 men from the same community, including 103 men who  are alcoholics. The team found that heavy smokers and those alcoholics both had lower IQ scores. 
In the further study, the experts found that smoking also appeared to be connected with weaker verbal   and visual-spatial reasoning  . So, though smoking did not account for all of the poorer mental function among the alcoholics, it did seem to account for some of the effects, the report shows. 
 Question:What's the purpose of the study that was carried out by Glass and her partners? 
A. To study if cigarette smoking can cause the cognitive deficits among alcoholics. 
B. To show that smoking and drinking has much connection with IQ and thinking ability. 
C. To show that smoking and drinking has little connection with IQ and thinking ability. 
D. To prove that smoking has no connection with drinking.

Context: If you go to Finland, you'll be surprised to find how ""foolish"" the Finnish people are.
Take the taxi drivers for example. Taxis in Finland are mostly high class Benz with a fare   of two US dollars a kilometer. You can go anywhere in one, tell the driver to drop you at any place, say that you have some business to attend to, and then get off without paying your fare. And the driver would not show the least sign of worry.
The dining rooms in all big hotels not only serve their guests, but also outside diners. Hotel guests have their meals free, so their good faith is to wave their registration card to the waiter. With such a loose check, you can easily use any old registration card to take a couple of friends and dine free of charge.
With so many loopholes   in everyday life, surely Finland must be a heaven to those who love to take ""pretty advantages"". But the strange things is, all the taxi-passengers would always come back to pay their fare after they have attended to their business; not a single outsider has ever been found in the free hotel dining rooms. As the Finns always act on good faith and always show an attitude of ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" in everything they do, so to live in such a society has turned everyone into a real ""gentleman"". In a society of such high moral practice, what need is there for people to take precautions   against others? 
 Question:The sentences ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" show that   _  . 
A. the Finns are foolish 
B. the Finns take things seriously 
C. the Finns are busy making money for the family 
D. the Finns never take precaution against others

We then had further delays on the way and had to wait another thirty minutes. As a result, I missed my plane from London to Frankfurt and had to wait for several hours.
What's more, the service on the train was also very poor. The trip took more than five hours. Unluckily. we could buy nothing but some soft drinks on the train. Worst of all, something was wrong with the air conditioning   and it got hotter and hotter in the train. Before we reached King's Cross, the temperature was over 40degC.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.

Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: I had arrived at the airport to catch an early flight home.It had been a very busy three days for me on an interstate trip with lots of meetings,business to do and new customers to meet.Then came the announcement that the flight had been delayed due to a technical problem.I could see a group of technicians and ground staff rushing about,obviously trying hard to fix the problem.I watched and listened as many of the passengers sitting near me shared their frustration about the inconvenience.
As I sat waiting,I reflected on my last meeting for the day.It was not a business meeting but rather a very enjoyable and brief lunch with an old business associate and friend I had not seen for over 12 years,and who I had worked with for nearly 15 years before we lost in touch.I had been given his phone number by a customer I had visited on the first day of my trip,so I called him out of the blue and made a time for us to meet.
Our lunch was spent recollecting  times gone by and as well filling each other in on what had happened in our lives over the last 12 years.Our conversation was frequently interrupted with statements such as 'remember when we did...','whatever happened to...' and of course the one we all liked to hear...'you know you haven't changed one bit,except for a few more grey hairs.'
We both laughed and smiled as we recalled the good times and the great experiences we had shared over the 15 years we had worked together. Each event we discussed caused another recollection and everything we talked about centered on the good times.Almost at the same time,right at the end of our time together,we both said how much we both enjoyed it and that we must do it again.We agreed to catch up when I was next in town,then said our goodbyes and I was off to the airport.
So with this extra time on my hands as I waited for my flight,it was great to revisit and replay in my mind all that we had talked about over lunch.I realized at that moment just how important it is to have regular reminders of the good times in your life and to be able to take the time to recall the past,for so much of what we have done in our past,shapes us and makes us who and what we are today and beyond.
At the end of my busy trip with the focus on getting all the business done,I was indeed fortunate enough to have had the chance to take a short break and reflect on the good things that had happened in my life over 12 years ago.It was somewhat like looking at an old photo album that you have found stored away in a cupboard in your house.There before your eyes are lots of wonderful memories in print that take you back to that time and place,and most importantly to those people who are in the photos.It also made me realize that when you get caught up doing what has to be done in the moment,it is easy to forget the people you have met in your life who have made a positive effect on and enriched you,often in only the smallest of ways.
My flight home was finally called nearly three hours later and yes as you would have expected many of the passengers cheered when the announcement was made.I smiled as I boarded the plane and realized that I was not at all upset about the delay,as I had been able to spend much of my time reflecting on the good times from days gone by and now eagerly look forward to many more opportunities to recall the past. 
 Question:Which of the following statements will the writer most probably support? 
A. It is impossible to avoid the inconvenience caused by flight delays. 
B. Our past experiences have a great influence on our future life. 
C. Looking forward is more important than looking back on the past. 
D. It is really a pity that the good old times will never come back. 
 Answer: B
Context: The day of my holiday arrived, but I wasn't looking forward to it. I had little money and had only been able to afford to stay with my Aunt Rosa in Spain. So, I wasn't really excited as I knew exactly what it was going to be like: lots of noisy cousins , and Aunt Rosa begging me to take her for a ride.
After I had checked in, I made my way slowly to the departure gate. As I was waiting to board the plane, I kept thinking about my ideal holiday destination: Jamaica, with its long, sandy beaches and crystal clear water.
As soon as the plane took off, I fell fast asleep and only woke to the sound of the announcement: ""Ladies and gentlemen, please fasten you seat belts, as we will shortly be landing in Kingston."" I froze in my seat. Was I dreaming? Kingston? Jamaica? I had boarded the wrong plane!
Immediately after the plane landed, I explained the situation to the authorities. It seems there were also three other passengers heading for Spain. Apparently it had been the airline's fault, since the flight numbers for Spain and Jamaica were exactly the same! Therefore, with no flight back to London for a week, the airline had no choice but to pay for our stay.
So there I was, lying on the beach, enjoying the music and the marvelous food of Jamaica! As for Aunt Rosa, I suppose she just had to live without me!

 Answer: A
Context: A U.S. dad quit his job, giving up a massive salary, after his 10-year-old daughter gave him a 22-point list outlining all the events he missed so far during the year. As the CEO of the $2 trillion global investment fund PIMCO, Mohamed El-Erian shocked the finance industry when he quit in January.
El-Erian said it was about a year ago when he was repeatedly asking his daughter to brush her teeth, but she wasn't listening. When he asked her why, she responded with a list of 22 milestones he had missed: like the first day of school and the first soccer game of the season.
""And the school year wasn't yet over,"" El-Erian wrote. ""I felt awful and got defensive: I had a good excuse for each missed event! Travel, important meetings, and urgent phone call, sudden to-dos. But it dawned on me that I was missing an infinitely more important point. My work-life balance had gotten out of whack, and the imbalance was hurting my very special relationship with my daughter. I was not making enough time for her."" El-Erian explained he was struggling with the same thing so many parents do--work-life balance.
Dads who are quitting their profit-making jobs to improve work-life balance is a subject that is getting more traction as some high-profile executive have recently written about their experiences.
Last month, former MongoDB CEO Max Schireson wrote a blog post for Time about his decision to step down from the company's top job. He wrote that he struggled to make time for his three children because he was flying around half a million kilometres a year for work.
""I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car, or when my son had an emergency surgery,"" Schireson wrote.
On an overnight flight to Texas he woke up in Arizona to discover the plane made an emergency landing and some traumatized crew members had to be replaced. He decided it was time to address his work-life balance.
Quitting is something El-Erian and Schireson were financially able to do, but El-Erian recognizes most people don't have this luxury. He hopes companies will pay attention to improving work-life balance for their employees.
El-Erian now manages ""a portfolio of part-time jobs"" that don't require as much travel. He alternates mornings with his wife taking their daughter to school and he often picks her up from school.
""So far, it's been the right decision for me,"" he wrote. ""I'm so grateful that this is providing me greater opportunity to experience key moments in my daughter's life before they're all too quickly gone."" 
 Question:El-Erian resigned from PIMCO mainly because   _  . 
A. his daughter has been missing him badly 
B. he was getting bored with the endless flights 
C. he hoped to get his daughter to listen to her 
D. he wanted to experience his daughter's milestones

Context: One Monday morning, Paul and his classmates were in science laboratory for their practical chemistry lesson. The students were going to work in pairs to do an experiment. Before they began, the teacher gave them this description of the different stages of the experiment.
Stage 1: Prepare the equipment: a test tube, a crucible, a Bunsen burner and tongs.
Stage 2: Weigh 5 grams of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and put it in a crucible.
Stage 3: Heat 10 ml of hydrochloric acid   in a test tube.
Stage 4: Pour the warm acid onto the baking soda and continue to heat the mixture.
Result: The acid reacts with the bicarbonate to form water, carbon dioxide gas and salt. The hotter the mixture, the quicker the reaction. Continue to heat the mixture until the water evaporates, leaving the salt in the crucible.
Paul and his partner followed the instructions and set up their equipment. Paul went to the cupboard to get a bottle of hydrochloric acid. He found that there was only one bottle in the cupboard so he took that. There was no label on the bottle and Paul didn't check with the teacher if it was the right solution.
He measured the liquid and poured it into a test tube. Using tongs to hold the test tube, he heated it over the Bunsen burner. That's when things started to go wrong. The liquid in the test tube was not hydrochloric acid. When it was heated, it formed a thick cloud of white gas. Soon the room was full of this strong smelling white gas.
All the students started coughing and their eyes hurt. The teacher immediately opened the windows and ordered the students to leave the laboratory at once. She realized that the liquid was a crylamide   and that it is poisonous.
Fortunately, nobody was injured in the incident. However, it taught the students and the teacher a good lesson. 
 Question:What substance were the students making in the experiment? 
A. Water 
B. Carbon dioxide gas

Context: As Apple tries to maintain its growth and success in China, the world's largest smart-phone market is becoming even more critical. Apple's shares  fell sharply as the company's earnings for the holiday quarter through December disappointed investors.
The sales of the iPhone, which include both the iPhone 5 and older models, came in at the low end of analysts' expectations, while the company's income plan for the second quarter was below analysts' forecasts, though Apple is known to give conservative   forecasts.
Som'6 analysts have said that for Apple to regain its growth, the company.needs a more aggressive strategy for markets, or more specifically for China, where the market for smart phones has been expanding more rapidly than anywhere else. In China, demand is particularly great for inexpensive phones that run on Android  operating system, sold by many Chinese phone makers as well as South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.
But Apple says it's already enjoying strong growth in China. ""We saw big growth in iPhones,""Chief Executive Tim Cook said. He said that the company has been quickly expanding its sales channels in China, including the number of Apple stores. ""This isn't nearly what we need, we're not even close to that, but we're making great progress. "" he said.
In China, a big missing piece for Apple is China Mobile Ltd. , the biggest local telecom carrier that doesn't yet sell the iPhone. Earlier this month, Mr. Cook met China Mobile Chairman Xi Guohua in Beijing and discussed cooperation, stirring hopes that the world's largest mobile carrier may soon start offering the iPhone.
Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is working on a lower-end iPhone that could launch as early as this year. But one possible challenge for Apple in China is that low-pricod Android-based phones are getting better in terms of quality. A report from CLSA in late November showed that many smart-phones sold at about 1,000 yuan ( $160) came with higher-reso-lution screens, better cameras and more powerful processors than phones at that price did a year earlier. 
 Question:What can we learn from the passage? 
A. Apple tends to offer a lower sales forecast. 
B. China Mobile Ltd began to team up with Apple. 
C. Cook is pessimistic about what Apple did in China. 
D. Apple didn't take measures to develop Chinese market.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture

Context: The rapid growth of Smartphones and electronic tablets is making the Internet favourite for Americans reading news, a report said.
News consumption online increased 17% last year from the year before. Television news, newspapers, radio and magazines all lost audience last year. For the first time, the number of people who get news online at least three times a week is larger than the number of people who get news from the newspapers. TV news has been the most popular since the 1960s. It has replaced the afternoon newspapers. But now the online news seems to be more popular than the TV news.
People are used to having the Internet available on phones or small tablets. In December, 2010, 41% of Americans said they got most of their news on the Internet, more than double the 17% who said that a year earlier, the report said. In January, 2011, 7% of Americans owned electronic tablets, nearly double what it was three months earlier. It was the fastest-growing new digital technology, ahead of mobile phones when they were introduced. The online ad income was expected to surpass print newspaper ad income for the first time in 2010.
The news business used to be the intermediary . You needed newspapers and TV stations to reach your customers. In this age of the computer, it's the software developers that you need. 
 Question:About   _   % of Americans got most of their news on the Internet in 2009.

Context: Bum rate is the speed at which a startup business consumes money. My rate would be $ 50,000 a month when my new media company started. So, I began looking around for individuals who would be my first investors. ""Angel money"" it was called. But when I reviewed my list of acquaintances to find those who might be able to help, I found the number got small.
With no other choices, I began meeting with the venture-capital companies. But I was warned they took a huge share of your company for the money they put in. And if you struggled, they could drop you cold.
As I was searching for ""angel money"", I started to build a team who trusted me even though I didn't have money for paychecks yet.
Bill Becker was an expert in computer programming and image processing at a very famous Media Lab at M. I.T. With his arrival, my company suddenly had a major technology ""guy"" in-house.
Katherine Henderson, a filmmaker and a former real-estate dealer, joined us as our director of market research. Steve White came on as operating officer. He had worked for the developer of a home-finance software, Quicken. We grabbed him.
We had some really good people, but we still didn't have enough money. One night, my neighbor, Louise Johnson, came for a visit. She and I were only nodding acquaintances, but her boys and ours were constant companions. She ran a very good business at the time.
Louise was brilliant and missed nothing. She had been watching my progress closely. She knew I was dying for money and I had prospects but could offer no guarantees of success.
She told me that her attorney had talked to mine and the terms had been agreed upon. She handed me an envelope. Inside was a check for $ 500,000.
I almost fell down. I heard her voice as if from heaven.
""I have confidence in your plan,"" she said. ""You' 11 do well. You're going to work hard for it, but it' s satisfying when you build your own company.""
Who would have thought I'd find an angel so close to home? There were no words sufficient for the moment. We just said good night. She left and I just stood there, completely humbled and completely committed.

 Answer: C
Context: People often ask me how I became successful in that six-year period of time while many of the people I knew did not. The answer is simple: The things I found to be easy to do, they found to be easy not to do.
I found it easy to set the goals that could change my life. They found it easy not to. I found it easy to read the books that could affect my thinking. They found that easy not to. I found it easy to attend the classes. They said it probably really wouldn't matter. Six years later, I'm a millionaire and they are all still blaming the economy, the government and company policies. They neglected  to do the basic, easy things.
In fact, the primary reason most people are not doing can be summed up in a single word: neglect. It is not the lack of money - banks are full of money. It is not the lack of opportunity - the government continues to offer the most opportunities. It is not the lack of books - libraries are full of books - and they are free! It is not the schools - the classrooms are full of good teachers. We have plenty of good advisors. The major reason that so few take advantage of all that we have is neglect.
Don't do the things which cause us to feel guilty  and guilt _ our self-confidence. As our self-confidence reduces, so does the level of our activity. And as our activity goes down, so do our results. And as our results suffer, our attitude begins to weaken. And as our attitude begins changing from positive to negative, our self-confidence becomes even less ... and on and on it goes.
So my suggestion is that when giving choice of ""easy to"" and ""easy not to"", do not neglect to do the simple, basic, ""easy"" but potentially life-changing activities. 
 Question:What would be the best title for the passage? 
A. Being self-confident works 
B. Nothing can not be neglected 
C. Everything is easy to do 
D. Success is easy, but so is neglect

Context: A team of engineers at Harvard University has been inspired by Nature to create the first robotic fly. The mechanical fly has become a platform for a series of new high-tech integrated systems. Designed to do what a fly does naturally, the tiny machine is the size of a fat housefly. Its mini wings allow it to stay in the air and perform controlled flight tasks.
""It's extremely important for us to think about this as a whole system and not just the sum of a bunch of individual components  ,"" said Robert Wood, the Harvard engineering professor who has been working on the robotic fly project for over a decade. A few years ago, his team got the go-ahead to start piecing together the components. ""The added difficulty with a project like this is that actually none of those components are off the shelf and so we have to develop them all on our own,"" he said.
They engineered a series of systems to start and drive the robotic fly. ""The seemingly simple system which just moves the wings has a number of interdependencies on the individual components, each of which individually has to perform well, but then has to be matched well to everything it's connected to,"" said Wood. The flight device was built into a set of power, computation, sensing and control systems. Wood says the success of the project proves that the flying robot with these tiny components can be built and manufactured.
While this first robotic flyer is linked to a small, off-board power source, the goal is eventually to equip it with a built-in power source, so that it might someday perform data-gathering work at rescue sites, in farmers' fields or on the battlefield. ""Basically it should be able to take off, land and fly around,"" he said.
Wood says the design offers a new way to study flight mechanics and control at insect-scale. Yet, the power, sensing and computation technologies on board could have much broader applications. ""You can start thinking about using them to answer open scientific questions, you know, to study biology in ways that would be difficult with the animals, but using these robots instead,"" he said. ""So there are a lot of technologies and open interesting scientific questions that are really what drives us on a day to day basis.""

Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries

Context: In 2007.five young people in the American state of Massachusetts developed an idea. The team knew that the world is filled with mobile phones.About eighty percent of all people are said to live within reach of a wireless telephone signal.    
    The idea was to use mobile phones and the Internet to connect job seekers with employers.The young people wrote a business plan and formed a company called Assured Labor.
    Assured Labor won a development competition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).Three of the founders were graduate students there.    '
    Assured Labo is an electronic market place.It has two parts.One is for;the United States.That operation was launched in January in Boston.It links people with employees offering temporary jobs.

    Assured Labor's president David Reich,says the companies now place job advertisements on radio or in newspapers.Some even drive around in cars with loudspeakers announcing that jobs are available.He says the companies are interested.in having more modem hiring practices.
    Through Assured Labor, companies will list open positions on the Internet.People who think
 they could do the job could reply by text messages or on their cellophanes.

Context: There are various ways in which individual economic units can interact with one another. Three basic ways may be described as the market system, the administered system, and the traditional system.
In a market system individual economic units are free to interact among each other in the marketplace. It is possible to buy commodities from other economic units or sell commodities to them. In a market, transactions may take place via barter or money exchange. In a barter economy, _ goods such as automobiles, shoes, and pizzas are traded against each other. Obviously, finding somebody who wants to trade my old car in exchange for a sailboat may not always be an easy task. Hence, the introduction of money as a medium of exchange eases transactions considerably. In the modern market economy, goods and services are bought or sold for money.
An alternative to the market system is administrative control by some agency over all transactions. This agency will issue commands as to how much of each good and service should be produced, exchanged, and consumed by each economic unit. Central planning may be one way of administering such an economy. The central plan, drawn up by the government, shows the amounts of each commodity produced by the various firms and allocated to different households for consumption. This is an example of complete planning of production, consumption, and exchange for the whole economy.
In a traditional society, production and consumption patterns are governed by tradition; every person's place within the economic system is fixed by parentage, religion, and custom. Transactions take place on the basis of tradition, too. People belonging to a certain group or caste  may have an obligation to care for other persons, provide them with food and shelter, care for their health, and provide for their education. Clearly, in a system where every decision is made on the basis of tradition alone, progress may be difficult to achieve. An inactive society may result. 
 Question:According to the passage, a barter economy can generate   _  . 
A. rapid speed of transactions 
B. misunderstandings 
C. inflation 
D. difficulties for the traders

Context: China and Japan are respectively the world's secondandthirdlargest economies. In 2008, China-Japan trade grew to $266.4 billion, a rise of 12.5 percent on 2007, making China and Japan the top two-way trading partners. China was also the biggest destination for Japanese exports in 2009.
The relationship between China and Japan has been  _ at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge itswartimepast to the satisfaction of China. China joined other Asian countries, such asSouth Korea,North KoreaandSingapore, in criticizing Japanese history textbooks that whitenJapanese war crimesinWorld War II. They claimed that the rise ofmilitarismbecame evident in Japanese politics. Muchanti-Japanese emotion has risen, because of the increasing feelings ofChinese nationalismand former Prime MinisterJunichiro Koizumi's visits to theYasukuni Shrine . Although Koizumi openly declared---in a statement made on April 22, 2005 in Jakarta--- ""deep regret"" overJapan's wartime crimes, many Chinese observers regard the apology as insufficient and not consistent with the action.
Sino-Japan relations changed slightly after Shinzo Abebecame thePrime Minister of Japanin September 2006, and a joint historical study conducted by China and Japan released a report in 2010 which pointed toward new agreement on the issue ofWorld War II-era violent action.
However, there also remains the dispute  over the Diaoyu Islands, which resulted in clashes between Taiwanese (Chinese) protesters and the Japanese government in April 2005. The incident led to anti-Japanese protests and violence across Mainland China, from BeijingtoShanghai, laterGuangzhou,ShenzhenandShenyang. In August 2012, Hong Kong activists landed on one of the disputed Diaoyu Islands, and Japanese nationalists responded by landing on the island the following week. The incidents set off the largest-scale anti-Japanese protests in China for decades in which protesters vandalized Japanese shops and cars. On the 14th of September relations worsened even further in response to Japan's announcement of plans to buy the island from its private owners. The news resulted in the Chinese government sending six surveillance  ships to the islands and further anti-Japanese protests in which protesters attacked the Japanese embassies in Shanghai and Beijing. 
 Question:Which of the following can improve the Sino-Japan relations? 
A. Strengthening their economic tie. 
B. Reaching an agreement on their disputes. 
C. Stopping vandalizing Japanese shops and cars. 
D. Shinzo Abe becoming Japanese prime minister.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: prefix = st1 /China's economic growth 'hard to predict'
The worsening global economic situation makes it difficult for Chinato predict its growth for next year, a senior official said on Friday.
""How fast China's economy will grow next year is uncertain,"" Liu He, deputy director of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Finance and Economy Work, told China Daily.
""To a large  _ , the rate will be decided by the external situation,"" Liu said during a discussion with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and other economists in Beijing.
This year, GDP is estimated to grow at 9.4 or 9.5 percent, down from 10.6 percent last year, he said. However, the impact of the current financial turbulence ""on our economy is much less than on the rest of the world"", he said.
Nicholas Stern, a former UK government advisor, also told China Daily it will take at least one or two years for the world to recover from the recession, which is now spreading from the US and the UK to the rest of the world.
""We don't know how long the recession will last, but it is unlikely to be short,"" he said.
Liu said China can use the downturn as an opportunity to restructure its economy, which has relied heavily on government investment, foreign trade and low-cost technology over the past years.
""When the economy is experiencing fast growth, companies are unwilling to upgrade their technologies,"" Liu said.
""The slowdown gives such firms the opportunity to enhance their competitive edge through better technologies.""

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT.""

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair.

Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners.

A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars.

Based on the question, the option and the context select the most appropriate answer from the provided choices ""A."", ""B."", ""C."" and ""D."".
Context: If you go to Finland, you'll be surprised to find how ""foolish"" the Finnish people are.
Take the taxi drivers for example. Taxis in Finland are mostly high class Benz with a fare   of two US dollars a kilometer. You can go anywhere in one, tell the driver to drop you at any place, say that you have some business to attend to, and then get off without paying your fare. And the driver would not show the least sign of worry.
The dining rooms in all big hotels not only serve their guests, but also outside diners. Hotel guests have their meals free, so their good faith is to wave their registration card to the waiter. With such a loose check, you can easily use any old registration card to take a couple of friends and dine free of charge.
With so many loopholes   in everyday life, surely Finland must be a heaven to those who love to take ""pretty advantages"". But the strange things is, all the taxi-passengers would always come back to pay their fare after they have attended to their business; not a single outsider has ever been found in the free hotel dining rooms. As the Finns always act on good faith and always show an attitude of ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" in everything they do, so to live in such a society has turned everyone into a real ""gentleman"". In a society of such high moral practice, what need is there for people to take precautions   against others? 
 Question:The sentences ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" show that   _  . 
A. the Finns are foolish 
B. the Finns take things seriously 
C. the Finns are busy making money for the family 
D. the Finns never take precaution against others 
 Answer: B
Context: If you walk slowly through downtown Helsinki during the day, taking in the splendid 19thcentury buildings, white boats and noise of passing trams , you will start to understand why it is called a city of two colors: white and blue.
The sea is always present in Helsinki. When you take a walk over the great open space of the central square, you will hear seabirds screaming. When you take the tram ,suddenly and unexpectedly, you are faced with a calm, shining blue sea. You may notice that people in Helsinki do not rush about as in other cities. Instead ,they walk along the roads, politely letting other people by.
An usual way to see Helsinki for the first time is to start out by the boats. You will walk by the elderly women selling fish and vegetables in the market square and find yourself in front of a beautiful park. You may enjoy a pleasant walk in the park for a few hours and then take the tram. Trams are the perfect way to get around in Helsinki. Watching the old houses, parks, theatres, churches, shops, restaurants and people in the streets, you may have a slightly sad film feeling to it.
The pale summer nights are another wonder in the city. Following the waterfront of the city after sunset, you couldn't help stopping and listening to the sweet silence, interrupted only by the screaming seabirds and leaving fishing boats.
However, in some way. Helsinki is also the most modern city in northern Europe. You will surely want to visit the white Glass Palace, the modern art museum, and all those extremely popular cafes and design stores. 
 Question:Helsinki is called a city of two colors mainly because of the colors of its   _ 
A. 19th century buildings, boats and parks 
B. 19th century buildings, boats and seabirds 
C. old houses, parks and trams 
D. old buildings, boats and the sea

Context: Many American women are earning money outside their homes today. Among women who are eighteen to sixty-four years old, more than fifty per cent have jobs.
    In general, working women have had more education then those who stay at home. Of those who work, thirty-two per cent have attended college, compared with twenty per cent of those who do not have jobs.
    Among women with jobs, eight out of ten drive a car to work, and eight per cent took a vacation a way from home during the past year. Much of their traveling was by air.
    These figures come from a report which was written for advertisers. The report gives advertisers a new picture of women today. For instance, it tells advertisers that fifty-one per cent of all American women have traveled by air--along with fifty-nine per cent of all American men.
    The lesson for American business is that many women now have other interests in addition to their homes. They like advertisements which show women in office, planes, and cars. 
 Question:The selection offers the least practical help to   _  . 
A. personnel managers, who hire new employees 
B. advertising agencies responsible for encouraging people to buy 
C. travel agencies 
D. accountants

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

The Chicago school's 420 students learn about economic . They also get a chance to make money. Each 1stgrade and 5thgrade, students learn the basics of economics and investing .
Then in 6thgrade, they put what they've learned to work. Students join a junior group that manages the $20,000. The group, made up of 12 to 14 students, decides which stocks to buy.
After graduating, students pass on $20,000 to the next 1stgrade class. They keep half of the rest of the money; the other half goes toward improving the school. They can choose to put their money in a college-savings program or take the cash.
In 2007, Bills suggested that her class buy the stock of the Apple computer company. This was just before the iPhone came out. ""We bought stock just at the right time,"" she says. The kids bought Google stock as it reached $400 a share. It is now worth over $500. ""It was a good buy,"" says Myles Gate, 13. He hopes to be a banker one day.

Context: The rapid growth of Smartphones and electronic tablets is making the Internet favourite for Americans reading news, a report said.
News consumption online increased 17% last year from the year before. Television news, newspapers, radio and magazines all lost audience last year. For the first time, the number of people who get news online at least three times a week is larger than the number of people who get news from the newspapers. TV news has been the most popular since the 1960s. It has replaced the afternoon newspapers. But now the online news seems to be more popular than the TV news.
People are used to having the Internet available on phones or small tablets. In December, 2010, 41% of Americans said they got most of their news on the Internet, more than double the 17% who said that a year earlier, the report said. In January, 2011, 7% of Americans owned electronic tablets, nearly double what it was three months earlier. It was the fastest-growing new digital technology, ahead of mobile phones when they were introduced. The online ad income was expected to surpass print newspaper ad income for the first time in 2010.
The news business used to be the intermediary . You needed newspapers and TV stations to reach your customers. In this age of the computer, it's the software developers that you need. 
 Question:About   _   % of Americans got most of their news on the Internet in 2009. 
A. 7 
B. 17 
C. 24 
D. 51

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B

Context: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth.
An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, ""the worst came to the worst"". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door.
The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced.
Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank. He says the plant seeds would only be used when all other seeds are gone for some reason. Norwayfirst proposed the idea in the 1980s. But security concerns delayed the plan. At that time, the Soviet Union was meeting inRomeof the Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the above passage? 
A. The government of Norwaywill perform the project alone. 
B. Seeds to be collected there were produced ten thousands years ago. 
C. Spitsbergen is chosen because it is free of the threat unclear war forever. 
D. Temperature is a major consideration when choosing the storage place. 
 Answer: D
Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer

Based on the question, the option and the context select the most appropriate answer from the provided choices ""A."", ""B."", ""C."" and ""D."".
Context: My summer hols wr CWOT. B4, we usd 2 go 2 NY 2C my bro, his CF & thr 3:-@ kids FTF ILNY, its gr8.
Can you understand this sentence? If you can't, don't feel too bad: neither could the middle school teacher in England who received this as homework. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cellphones. To newcomers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the ""translation"" of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York; it's great.
Schoolteachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes cxan be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted .
Everyone should just relax, say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nunberg, from Stanford University, agrees. ""People get better at writing by writing,"" he says, ""Kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mail, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than, their parents.""
Linguist James Millroy says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can bet your bottom dollar that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents, they too will think this way. Milroy argues that languages do not and cannot become ""corrupted""; they simply change to meet the new needs.
However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write Standard English. Cynthia McVey says, ""I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but that learning to write proper English is a must for their future.""
Perhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway. Erin, age 12, says, ""I wouldn't use text language in my homework. Texting is just for fun"" 
 Question:Which of the following is true according to the passage? 
A. Cynthia McVey points out teenagers can deal with Netspeak properly. 
B. Geoffrey Nunberg believes Netspeakers can write Standard English. 
C. David Crystal thinks Netspeak helps develop the habit of writing. 
D. James Milroy says that language is changing and improving. 
 Answer: C
Context: An environment group called the Food Commission is unhappy and disappointed because of the sales of bottled water from Japan. The water, it angrily argues in public, has traveled 10,000 "" _ "" before it reaches Western customers. ""Transporting water half-way across the world is surely the extremely stupid use of fuel when there is plenty of water in the UK."" It is also worried that we are wasting our fuel by buying prawns from Indonesia (7,000 food miles) and carrots from South Africa (5,900 food miles).
Counting the number of miles traveled by a product is a strange way of trying to tell the true situation of the environmental damage done by an industry. Most food is transported around the world on container ships that are extremely energy-efficient. It should be noted that a ton of butter transported 25 miles in a truck to a farmers' market does not necessarily use less fuel on its journey than a similar product transported hundreds of miles by sea, Besides, the idea of ""food miles"" ignores the amount of fuel used in the production. It is possible to cut down your food miles by buying tomatoes grown in Britain rather than those grown in Ghana; the difference is that the British ones will have been raised in heated greenhouses and the Ghanaian ones in the open sun.
What is the idea of ""food miles"" does provide, however, is the chance to cut out Third World countries from First World food markets. The number of miles traveled by our food should, as I see it, be regarded as a sign of the success of the global trade system, not a sign of damage to the environment. 
 Question:By comparing tomatoes raised in Britain and in Ghana, the author tries to explain that  _  . 
A. British tomatoes are healthier than Ghanaian ones 
B. Ghanaian tomatoes taste better than British ones 
C. cutting down food miles may not necessarily save fuel 
D. protecting the environment may cost a lot of money

Context: Who are the top students in the world, do you know? Last week the Organization for Economic Co-operation Development   picked the best students in the world. They are Finnish  . The OECD gave a test to 280 000 15-year-old students from more than 40 countries and regions   last year. The OECD wanted to know how well students were doing at school.
Finnish students were No. 1 in the reading test and second in maths after Hong Kong students. Those from Japan and Finland were top in science. In the problem solving, Finnish students came second to those from South Korea. The test also showed Finland had more top students than the other countries.
Finns   of your age have done a really good job but don't have a sense of envy. You can learn from them. Most Finnish students make good use of the Internet. Of course not for computer games, but for doing more exercises and finding out more information.
Libraries are also important. Finland spends a lot of money on them. Many students have a free card. They read for at least one or two hours a day.
What do you usually do on the Internet? How often do you go to libraries? 
 Question:Students from which country or region did best in the reading test? 
A. South Korea. 
B. Hong Kong. 
C. Finland. 
D. Japan.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .

A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle.

Context: The organization representing British universities has expressed concern about the potential effect of tuition fees after figures showed a drop of more than 6% in student applications with less than a month to go before the deadline for 2013 applications.
Data from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) showed there were 265,784 university applications by UK-based candiates up to 17 Decemeber, 6.3% down on the parallel period in the admissions cycle the year before. While this is less than the 8.4% year-on-uear fall seen in earlier Ucas figures, released in mid-November, the coming January deadline makes it ever more likely that the total 2013 applicant figure will see a second sizeable fall following the introduction of annual fees of up to PS9,000.
Nicola Dandridge, the chairman of Universities UK, said : ""However, we must be concerned about any drops in the numbers applying to university and in particular, we must look closely at how the increase in graduate contributions in England may be affecting the decisions of promising students. However ,the December figures show a drop in numbers across the UK, suggesting that it is not only a question of tuition fees in England putting off from applying.""
A report of the Uncas figures to mid-December shows a 6.5% fall for applicants in England and 11.7% for those in Wales, with smaller drops of 3.9% for Scotland and 0.5% for Nortern Ireland. Scotiish students at home insitiutions pay on fees, while those from Nothern Ireland have fees capped to PS3,575 for Northern Irish universities.
Dandridge added: ""No one should be put off applying to university because of worries about finance.""
""It is important that no one is put off applying to university because they do not have information about the student support available to them. Most new students don't need to pay directly. There will be more financial support for those from poorer families and everyone will make lower loan repayments thatn they do now once they are in well paid jobs."" 
 Question:Compared with the previous year, the fall in student applications is  _  . 
A. 3.9% 
B. 6% 
C. 6.3% 
D. 8.4%

Context: If you go to Finland, you'll be surprised to find how ""foolish"" the Finnish people are.
Take the taxi drivers for example. Taxis in Finland are mostly high class Benz with a fare   of two US dollars a kilometer. You can go anywhere in one, tell the driver to drop you at any place, say that you have some business to attend to, and then get off without paying your fare. And the driver would not show the least sign of worry.
The dining rooms in all big hotels not only serve their guests, but also outside diners. Hotel guests have their meals free, so their good faith is to wave their registration card to the waiter. With such a loose check, you can easily use any old registration card to take a couple of friends and dine free of charge.
With so many loopholes   in everyday life, surely Finland must be a heaven to those who love to take ""pretty advantages"". But the strange things is, all the taxi-passengers would always come back to pay their fare after they have attended to their business; not a single outsider has ever been found in the free hotel dining rooms. As the Finns always act on good faith and always show an attitude of ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" in everything they do, so to live in such a society has turned everyone into a real ""gentleman"". In a society of such high moral practice, what need is there for people to take precautions   against others? 
 Question:The sentences ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" show that   _  . 
A. the Finns are foolish 
B. the Finns take things seriously 
C. the Finns are busy making money for the family 
D. the Finns never take precaution against others 
 Answer: B
Context: The government of prefix = st1 /Norwayis planning to build an unusual storage center on an island in the Arctic Ocean. The place would be large enough to hold about two million seeds. The goal is to present all crops known to scientists. The British magazine New Scientist published details of the plan last month. The structure will be designed to protect the world's food supply against nuclear war, climate change and other possible threats. It will be built in a mountain on the NorwegianislandofSpitsbergen. The mountain is less than one thousand kilometers from the North Pole, the northernmost position on earth.
An international group called the Global Crop Diversity Trust is working on the project. The director of the group, Cary Fowler, spoke to New Scientist. He said the project would let the world rebuild agriculture if, in his word, ""the worst came to the worst"". Norwayis expected to start work next year. The project is expected to cost three million dollars. Workers will drill deep in the side of a sandstone mountain. Temperatures in the area never rise above 0oC. The seeds will be protected behind concrete walls a meter thick and high-security door.
The magazine report says the collection will represent the products of ten thousand years of farming. Most of the seeds at first will come from collections at seed banks in Africa, Asia and Latin America. To last a long time, seeds need to be kept in very low temperatures. Workers will not be present all the time. But they plan to replace the air inside the storage space each winter. Winter temperatures on the island are about eighteen degrees below 0oC. The cold weather would protect the seeds even if the air could not be replaced.
Mr. Fowler says the proposed structure will be the world's most secure gene bank. He says the plant seeds would only be used when all other seeds are gone for some reason. Norwayfirst proposed the idea in the 1980s. But security concerns delayed the plan. At that time, the Soviet Union was meeting inRomeof the Food and Agriculture Organization. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is TRUE according to the above passage? 
A. The government of Norwaywill perform the project alone. 
B. Seeds to be collected there were produced ten thousands years ago. 
C. Spitsbergen is chosen because it is free of the threat unclear war forever. 
D. Temperature is a major consideration when choosing the storage place.

Can you understand this sentence? If you can't, don't feel too bad: neither could the middle school teacher in England who received this as homework. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cellphones. To newcomers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the ""translation"" of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York; it's great.
Schoolteachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes cxan be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted .
Everyone should just relax, say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nunberg, from Stanford University, agrees. ""People get better at writing by writing,"" he says, ""Kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mail, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than, their parents.""
Linguist James Millroy says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can bet your bottom dollar that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents, they too will think this way. Milroy argues that languages do not and cannot become ""corrupted""; they simply change to meet the new needs.
However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write Standard English. Cynthia McVey says, ""I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but that learning to write proper English is a must for their future.""
Perhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway. Erin, age 12, says, ""I wouldn't use text language in my homework. Texting is just for fun"" 
 Question:Which of the following is true according to the passage? 
A. Cynthia McVey points out teenagers can deal with Netspeak properly.

Context: Cyberspace, data superhighway, multimedia, for those who have seen the future, and the linking of computers, televisions and telephones will change our lives for ever. Yet for all the talks of a forthcoming technological utopia, little attention has been given to the implications of these developments for the poor. As for all the new high technology, the West concerns itself with the ""how"", while the question of ""for whom"" is put aside once again.
Economists are only now realizing the full extent to which the communication revolution has affected the world economy. Information technology allows the extension of trade across geographical and industrial boundaries, and transnational corporations take full advantage of it. Terms of trade and exchange, interest rates and money movements are more important than the production of goods. The electronic economy made by information technology allows the haves to increase their control on global markets -- with a destructive impact on the havenots.
For them the result is unstable. Developing countries which rely on the production of a small range of goods for export are made to feel like small parts in the international economic machine. As ""futures"" are traded on computer screens, developing countries simply have less and less control of their destinies.
So what are the options of regaining control?One alternative for developing countries is to buy in the latest computers and telecommunications. Yet this leads to long-term dependency and perhaps permanent constraints ( ,) on developing countries' economies.
Communication technology is generally exported from the US, Europe or Japan;the patents, skills and ability remain in the hands of a few industrialized countries. It is also expensive, therefore imported products and services must be bought on credit usually provided by the very countries whose companies stand to gain. 
 Question:It can be inferred from the passage that   _   . 
A. international trade should be expanded 
B. the interests of the poor countries have not been given enough consideration 
C. the exports of the poor countries should be increased 
D. communication technology in developing countries should be modernized

Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption 
 Answer: D

Context: Frank Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York., in 1852. His family were very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for showing goods to attract people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends ( ) for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said five cents each. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store., selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1000 stores in the US and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always run his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: "" The customer is always right.""

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair.

A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.

Context: Decreasing grain prices along with growing costs of production means Chinese farmers are unlikely to see a significant rise in income next year. [:ZXXK]
China's economic planning chief Ma Kai expressed the concern as the government undertakes an ambitious program to improve rural people's lives.
Grain prices have been dropping since April; and prices of wheat, corn and rice fell 5 per cent from August to October compared with the same period last year, Ma, minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, told an annual meeting on development and reform held over the weekend.
Meanwhile, prices of production materials rose 9.1 per cent year on year during the first 10 months.
The situation makes it difficult to achieve a ""new socialist countryside,"" which was last week highlighted as a new concept and ""common action"" of the whole Party and nation.
Vice-Minister of Agriculture Yin Chengjie also said China's entry to the World Trade Organization also creates _ for income rises for the country's 780 million farmers.
Farmers' income is expected to increase by 5 per cent this year, hitting the target set by the central government at the beginning of this year.
Last year, per capita net income of Chinese farmers reached 2,936 yuan (US$362), up 6.8 per cent year on year, and the highest increase since 1997.
Ma also said China would continue to seek fast, steady economic growth in 2012 but more efforts will be made to deal with the challenges brought about by overheating in some industrial sectors  .

Context: Doctors have a new weapon in the battle against obesity   -- a talking plate that tells people not to eat too quickly. The Mandometer monitors the amount of food leaving the plate, and tells users, ""Please eat more slowly.""
The PS1,500 Swedish device is to be used in a National Health Service plan to help hundreds of obese families lose weight. It comes in two parts -- a scale placed under the plate and a small computer screen showing a graphic  of the food gradually disappearing as the user eats. A red line on the screen shows the user's eating speed, while a blue line shows a healthy rate. If the user eats too fast, the red line angles away from the blue one, warning him or her to _ . If the lines deviate   too much, the computer voice comes on, and the  screen flashes the message ""Are you feeling full yet?"" to remind users to think about whether they have had enough.
Britain has an increasingly serious obesity problem, with one in four adults and one in seven children classed as obese. After a recent trial using the device, experts believe teaching obese people to eat more slowly will help them know when they are full. Around 600 families with at least one obese parent and child (aged five or older) were targeted in the project by Bristol University, along with GPs and nurses.
Professor Julian Hamilton-Shield, who is leading the plan, says obese children and adolescents using the Mandometer ate from 12 to 15 percent less per meal at the end of the 12-month trial. Six months after they stopped using the device they still ate less, and continued to lose weight. ""It will be a powerful tool to help families retrain their eating habits,"" he says. 
 Question:What does the red line on the screen show? 
A. A healthy rate of eating. 
B. Too much food is left. 
C. The user's eating speed. 
D. The user is full. 
 Answer: C
Context: Even a small reduction in salt in the diet can be a big help to the heart. A new study used a computer model to predict how just three grams less a day would affect heart disease in the United States.
The result: thirteen percent fewer heart attacks. Eight percent fewer strokes. Four percent fewer deaths. Eleven percent fewer new cases of heart disease. And two hundred forty billion dollars in health care savings. 
Researchers found it could prevent one hundred thousand heart attacks and ninety-two thousand deaths every year.
The study is in the New England Journal of Medicine. Kirsten, at the University of California, was the lead author. She says people would not even notice a difference in taste with three grams, or one-half teaspoon, less salt per day. The team also included researchers at Stanford and Columbia University.
Each gram of salt contains four hundred milligrams of sodium, which is how foods may list their salt content.
The government says the average American man eats ten grams of salt a day. The American Heart Association advises no more than three grams for healthy people. It says salt in the American diet has increased fifty percent since the nineteen seventies, while blood pressures have also risen. Less salt can mean a lower blood pressure.
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is leading an effort called the National Salt Reduction Initiative. The idea is to put pressure on food companies and restaurants. 
Mayor Bloomberg has already succeeded in other areas, like requiring fast food places in the city to list calorie information. Now a study by the Seattle Children's Research Institute shows how that idea can influence what parents order for their children.
Ninety-nine parents of three to six year olds took part. Half had McDonald's menus clearly showing how many calories were in each food. The other half got menus without the calorie information. 
 Question:All the following are related to the salt in diet except   _  . 
A. strokes 
B. heart attacks 
C. blood pressures 
D. stomach diseases

Context: China's economic growth ""hard to predict""
The worsening global economic situation makes it difficult for China to predict its growth for next year, a senior official said on Friday.
""How fast China's economy will grow next year is uncertain,"" Liu He, deputy director of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Finance and Economy Work, told China Daily.
""To a large
, the rate will be decided by the external  situation,"" Liu said during a discussion with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and other economists in Beijing.
""This year, GDP is estimated to grow at 9.4 or 9.5 percent, down from 10.6 percent last year,"" he said. ""However, the impact of the current financial turbulence on our economy is much less than on the rest of the world.""
Nicholas Stern, a former UK government advisor, also told China Daily it will take at least one or two years for the world to recover from the recession, which is now spreading from the US and the UK to the rest of the world.
""We don't know how long the recession will last, but it is unlikely to be short,"" he said.
Liu said China can use the downturn  as an opportunity to restructure its economy, which has relied heavily on government investment, foreign trade and low-cost technology over the past years.
""When the economy is experiencing fast growth, companies are unwilling to upgrade their technologies,"" Liu said.
""The slowdown gives such firms the opportunity to enhance  their competitive edge through better technologies.""

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: The Government should raise taxes on air travel and high-polluting cars in order to help the environment, an important committee of MPs  has said. It also said that the 70 mph speed limit on motorways should be reduced or enforced to bring down the amount of carbon dioxide given off by cars The House of Common Enviromental Audit committee's latest report said that transport was the only sector of the UK where carbon  _ have continued to rise since 1990.
It said it was time for the Government to make demand for cheap air impossible by raising air passenger tax. Emissions from air traffic have risen by 5 times as much since 1900 and are continuing to rise.
The committee welcomed the recent introduction of changed car tax, which means that the lowest-carbon cars pay no road tax, while gas-guzzling 4x4s pay an increased rate of PS210. However, the MPs say it doesn't go far enough and are calling for a top limit of PS1,800 with lower limit of PS200.
Committee chairman Tim Yeo said : ""Air travel in particular is the fastest growing source of CO2, with emissions more than five times since 1900. The Government should take much more decisive action to reduce the difference of income favor of trains, buses, and lower carbon cars and lorries.""
Friends of the Earth's senior organizer Tony Bosworth said: ""Emissions from transport are still rising and forecasts suggest they will carry on rising for years to come.""
""Tinkering around the edges is no longer enough to deal with the greatest threat the world faces."" A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""Dealing with carbon emissions in transport is a key problem."" 
 Question:Which of the following is the best title for the passage? 
A. Transport is the biggest polluter 
B. Raise taxes on air travel and high-polluting cars 
C. Deal with greatest threat the world faces 
D. Air travel in particular is the fastest growing sources of CO2

Context: An environment group called the Food Commission is unhappy and disappointed because of the sales of bottled water from Japan. The water, it angrily argues in public, has traveled 10,000 "" _ "" before it reaches Western customers. ""Transporting water half-way across the world is surely the extremely stupid use of fuel when there is plenty of water in the UK."" It is also worried that we are wasting our fuel by buying prawns from Indonesia (7,000 food miles) and carrots from South Africa (5,900 food miles).
Counting the number of miles traveled by a product is a strange way of trying to tell the true situation of the environmental damage done by an industry. Most food is transported around the world on container ships that are extremely energy-efficient. It should be noted that a ton of butter transported 25 miles in a truck to a farmers' market does not necessarily use less fuel on its journey than a similar product transported hundreds of miles by sea, Besides, the idea of ""food miles"" ignores the amount of fuel used in the production. It is possible to cut down your food miles by buying tomatoes grown in Britain rather than those grown in Ghana; the difference is that the British ones will have been raised in heated greenhouses and the Ghanaian ones in the open sun.
What is the idea of ""food miles"" does provide, however, is the chance to cut out Third World countries from First World food markets. The number of miles traveled by our food should, as I see it, be regarded as a sign of the success of the global trade system, not a sign of damage to the environment. 
 Question:By comparing tomatoes raised in Britain and in Ghana, the author tries to explain that  _  . 
A. British tomatoes are healthier than Ghanaian ones 
B. Ghanaian tomatoes taste better than British ones 
C. cutting down food miles may not necessarily save fuel 
D. protecting the environment may cost a lot of money

Context: If you go to Finland, you'll be surprised to find how ""foolish"" the Finnish people are.
Take the taxi drivers for example. Taxis in Finland are mostly high class Benz with a fare   of two US dollars a kilometer. You can go anywhere in one, tell the driver to drop you at any place, say that you have some business to attend to, and then get off without paying your fare. And the driver would not show the least sign of worry.
The dining rooms in all big hotels not only serve their guests, but also outside diners. Hotel guests have their meals free, so their good faith is to wave their registration card to the waiter. With such a loose check, you can easily use any old registration card to take a couple of friends and dine free of charge.
With so many loopholes   in everyday life, surely Finland must be a heaven to those who love to take ""pretty advantages"". But the strange things is, all the taxi-passengers would always come back to pay their fare after they have attended to their business; not a single outsider has ever been found in the free hotel dining rooms. As the Finns always act on good faith and always show an attitude of ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" in everything they do, so to live in such a society has turned everyone into a real ""gentleman"". In a society of such high moral practice, what need is there for people to take precautions   against others? 
 Question:The sentences ""which is which"" and ""what is what"" show that   _  . 
A. the Finns are foolish 
B. the Finns take things seriously 
C. the Finns are busy making money for the family 
D. the Finns never take precaution against others

Context: According to the Small Business Association, more than 50 percent of all small businesses fail within the first five years. This is not the case for Apiary Fund CEO, Shawn Lucas. Shawn has grown a very successful business focusing on teaching people how to trade foreign currencies. The Apiary Fund not only gives their traders some of the best Forex   education possible but also gives their traders money to trade with. The Apiary Fund had a slow start but has now become a company that recently hit $1 billion in trader volume  . The Apiary Fund's success has come from the great business concept, and work ethic  .
* Business Concept
The Apiary Fund has a very special but effective business concept, which Shawn Lucas discovered many years ago. You are probably wondering, where did this business concept come from? Shawn, while working as a Financial Advisor, received a phone call one day from a man he hadn't ever spoken to before. The man asked Shawn to go with him to China to do an analysis of a Chinese company's trading systems. The company at the time was under investigation for a possible violation   of intellectual property rights. He agreed to go and before he knew it he was on a plane to China.
During the analysis of this Chinese company Shawn noticed the company had a very effective business method. He noticed that the risk manager had created a system that protected the company from rarely posting a losing day. The risk manager made this all possible by putting restrictions on the amount a trader could lose. If one of the traders lost even a small amount the risk manager would then be notified  .
Shawn left China with a business concept that would later consume much of his life. After returning home, Shawn was devoted to creating a similar risk management system as the Chinese company had created. That risk management system turned into a successful business called the Apiary Fund.
* Work Ethic
The business concept alone didn't magically make the Apiary Fund into a booming business. The Apiary Fund became successful from hard work and devotion. This hard work and devotion has recently brought the Apiary Fund to hit a trading volume high of $1 billion. Shawn Lucas believes that by the end of this year the Apiary Fund can expect to see double or triple that volume. The company has experienced immense growth by making a few changes to their program structure, which has since increased growth by about five times within the last year.
Successful businesses are hard to start, but with a good business concept and great work ethic anything is possible. Shawn and the Apiary Fund are a great example of both. 
 Question:What does Shawn's business do? 
A. Trading with foreigners. 
B. Lend money to those who need it. 
C. Help people to found their own business. 
D. Teach people how to trade foreign currencies.

Context: Decreasing grain prices along with growing costs of production means Chinese farmers are unlikely to see a significant rise in income next year. [:ZXXK]
China's economic planning chief Ma Kai expressed the concern as the government undertakes an ambitious program to improve rural people's lives.
Grain prices have been dropping since April; and prices of wheat, corn and rice fell 5 per cent from August to October compared with the same period last year, Ma, minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, told an annual meeting on development and reform held over the weekend.
Meanwhile, prices of production materials rose 9.1 per cent year on year during the first 10 months.
The situation makes it difficult to achieve a ""new socialist countryside,"" which was last week highlighted as a new concept and ""common action"" of the whole Party and nation.
Vice-Minister of Agriculture Yin Chengjie also said China's entry to the World Trade Organization also creates _ for income rises for the country's 780 million farmers.
Farmers' income is expected to increase by 5 per cent this year, hitting the target set by the central government at the beginning of this year.
Last year, per capita net income of Chinese farmers reached 2,936 yuan (US$362), up 6.8 per cent year on year, and the highest increase since 1997.
Ma also said China would continue to seek fast, steady economic growth in 2012 but more efforts will be made to deal with the challenges brought about by overheating in some industrial sectors  .

Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption 
 Answer: D
Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----. 
A. planted less corn 
B. planted morn crops 
C. planted morn wheat 
D. earned more money

 Answer: C
Context: On March 5, 2009, Michael Jackson stood in front of crowds of fans. Before screaming fans, he pronounced with pumping arms: ""This is it!""
A few months later, Jackson was dead. With the late pop star's return to radio, television and the cultural events, Forbes judges that Jackson has made $90 million since his death June 25. This figure is based on his royalties  from album sales, radio play, rights to his name and royalties from his stock in the Sony/ATV music catalog  .
Jackson's music was his most easily-seen source in the last months. ""Nothing increases the value of an artist than death ... an untimely death,"" says Barry Massarsky, a music industry economist.
The music's immediate value was clear. Since June, Jackson has sold more than 5.9 million albums in the U.S. and another 4.5 million overseas. In the first weeks after his death, there were 5.6 million single downloads across North America, Europe and Australia. Jackson recently has three of the top 20 best-selling albums of the year in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan. His 2003 hits album Number Ones is the best seller of the year, beating Taylor Swift's Fearless.
More than 500,000 Jackson ringtones and 100,000 music videos were sold. In the week following his death, songs by The Jackson 5, The Jacksons and Michael were played over 100,000 times on the radio, according to Nielsen BDS.
Jackson's estate will likely see more money by the end of this year, as it has rights to some of the profits from This Is It as well as the two-disc album of the same name. The estate will share 90% of the film profits with AEG.
Ticket sales from an exhibit opening in London will also contribute a likely profit. Hundreds of Jackson's personal belongings-his L.A. Rolls Royce etc-will remain on show for three months at the O2 for fans willing to shell out $25 for a view.
The pop singer bought ATV Publishing, for $47.5 million in 1985. Ten years later, he sold the catalog to Sony for $95 million and took a 50% stock in Sony/ATV, which is now worth about $1.7 to $2 billion. So he still owned half the Sony/ATV catalog at his death.
Jackson's future earning potential is based on his stock in valuable music and as well as the value of his image . As many musicians, actors and artists before him, Jackson's fame could have a long tail on the market with allowable products, advertising and entertainment events. 
 Question:All the following is true EXCEPT that   _  . 
A. Rolls Royce is now for show and will finally be sold 
B. Jackson has sold 10.4 million albums since June 
C. Jackson's L. 
D. Jackson's stock in music and his image will keep on earning money in the future

The boss knew that John had worked very hard for the years. He thought a moment and said, ""Thank you for what you said, but I hope you will do one more thing for our company before you leave""
John agreed. The boss asked him to go and find anyone selling watermelons in the market. John went and returned soon. He said he had found a man selling watermelons. The boss asked how much they cost every kilogram. John shook his head and went back to the seller to ask and returned to tell the boss $1.2 every kilogram.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns.

Context: Dear Mr. Watson,
CLAIM AL54323432--STORM DAMAGE TO ROOF
     I received a cheque for $623 dated 26 January in payment of my recent claim . However, I wish to tell you how upset I have been by the way your Claims Assessor, Mr. Michael Tan, handled this claim. 
    When Mr. Tan first called me, he specifically told me that he believed I had been overcharged, and he would expect to pay that price for work on a double garage, rather than a single garage like mine. Mr. Tan suggested that I neither use nor recommend this contractor again. He continued to tell me it was unlikely for me to receive full payment. Never during this conversation did he mention that the reason for not receiving full payment was because of the nature of my insurance policy. 
    Consequently, I wrote to Mr. Lance Ashe to complain about his pricing, stating that I was very upset thinking that he could have taken advantage by overcharging a 73-year-old woman. Mr. Ashe telephoned me immediately and explained his charges in detail. He later reported back to me that Mr. Tan explained that I would not receive full payment because of the type of policy I hold, which does not cover wear and tear. This was the first time this issue had been brought to my attention, so you can imagine my surprise. 
   When I received Mr. Tan's letter of 2 February, this situation was explained. If this had been explained in the first place I would have accepted it and would not have questioned Mr. Ashe's charges. Instead, by telling me initially that I had been overcharged for this work, he caused a great deal of upset, not only for me but also for Mr. Ashe. 
    I believed this claim was handled badly by Mr. Tan from the beginning. Therefore, a great deal of embarrassment has been caused over this issue. 
I felt you should know how disappointed and upset I am. I trust you will look into this and ensure that such claims are handled more appropriately in the future. 
                                               Yours sincerely,
                                                    Mrs. Richard 
 Question:We can learn from the passage that Mr. Tan works in a/an   _  .

Context: As Apple tries to maintain its growth and success in China, the world's largest smart-phone market is becoming even more critical. Apple's shares  fell sharply as the company's earnings for the holiday quarter through December disappointed investors.
The sales of the iPhone, which include both the iPhone 5 and older models, came in at the low end of analysts' expectations, while the company's income plan for the second quarter was below analysts' forecasts, though Apple is known to give conservative   forecasts.
Som'6 analysts have said that for Apple to regain its growth, the company.needs a more aggressive strategy for markets, or more specifically for China, where the market for smart phones has been expanding more rapidly than anywhere else. In China, demand is particularly great for inexpensive phones that run on Android  operating system, sold by many Chinese phone makers as well as South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.
But Apple says it's already enjoying strong growth in China. ""We saw big growth in iPhones,""Chief Executive Tim Cook said. He said that the company has been quickly expanding its sales channels in China, including the number of Apple stores. ""This isn't nearly what we need, we're not even close to that, but we're making great progress. "" he said.
In China, a big missing piece for Apple is China Mobile Ltd. , the biggest local telecom carrier that doesn't yet sell the iPhone. Earlier this month, Mr. Cook met China Mobile Chairman Xi Guohua in Beijing and discussed cooperation, stirring hopes that the world's largest mobile carrier may soon start offering the iPhone.
Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is working on a lower-end iPhone that could launch as early as this year. But one possible challenge for Apple in China is that low-pricod Android-based phones are getting better in terms of quality. A report from CLSA in late November showed that many smart-phones sold at about 1,000 yuan ( $160) came with higher-reso-lution screens, better cameras and more powerful processors than phones at that price did a year earlier. 
 Question:What can we learn from the passage? 
A. Apple tends to offer a lower sales forecast. 
B. China Mobile Ltd began to team up with Apple. 
C. Cook is pessimistic about what Apple did in China. 
D. Apple didn't take measures to develop Chinese market.

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----. 
A. planted less corn 
B. planted morn crops 
C. planted morn wheat 
D. earned more money

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.

Context: Food prices have risen sharply over the past few years. The good news is that the rate of increase has slowed. The bad news is that prices will not go down anytime soon.
Also,the rate of global agricultural production is slowing. Yet it needs to increase 60% over the next 40 years to feed a growing world population.
These are among the findings from the OECDFAO(the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development & the Food and Agriculture Organization)Agricultural Outlook 2012-2021.
FAO DirectorGeneral Jose Graziano da Silva spoke at a news conference in Rome when the report was released. Mr.Da Silva said that,not surprisingly,the world's poorest people will feel the greatest effects of higher prices.
""For the millions and millions of extremely poor people, the effects of high food prices are clear--they might have to change their diets,usually to ones with poorer nutrition quality, ""he said.
In middleincome countries, people are gaining weight as they eat fewer fruits and vegetables and more of the cheaper but less nutritious foods.
The report also shows that farmers in poorer countries will be leading efforts to feed an expected 9,000,000,000 people by 2050.The outlook predicts that farmers in Latin America,the Caribbean and subSaharan Africa will drive agricultural production in the future.
Angel Gurria,SecretaryGeneral of the OECD,said:""We can feed 9,000,000,000 people by 2050 on this planet. But we have to organize ourselves better."" But there are plenty of challenges.Onefourth of all agricultural land is damaged. Many countries face water shortages .And experts believe climate change is driving increasingly unusual weather patterns.
The report says farmers need to use more growing methods that can't cause damage to the environment.At the same time,it says governments should end economically harmful supports and spend more money to increase agricultural production.Mr.Gurria says rich and poor nations need to treat agriculture more like a business.
""In many cases,agriculture is related in people's minds to the poorest. It's related to aid. It's related to very poor living conditions,etc. We have got to shake that image away,""he said. 
 Question:What can be done to deal with the slow agricultural production? 
A. Improving the growing methods. 
B. Finding more agricultural land. 
C. Preventing governments' involvement. 
D. Improving farmers' living conditions.

Context: Decreasing grain prices along with growing costs of production means Chinese farmers are unlikely to see a significant rise in income next year. [:ZXXK]
China's economic planning chief Ma Kai expressed the concern as the government undertakes an ambitious program to improve rural people's lives.
Grain prices have been dropping since April; and prices of wheat, corn and rice fell 5 per cent from August to October compared with the same period last year, Ma, minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, told an annual meeting on development and reform held over the weekend.
Meanwhile, prices of production materials rose 9.1 per cent year on year during the first 10 months.
The situation makes it difficult to achieve a ""new socialist countryside,"" which was last week highlighted as a new concept and ""common action"" of the whole Party and nation.
Vice-Minister of Agriculture Yin Chengjie also said China's entry to the World Trade Organization also creates _ for income rises for the country's 780 million farmers.
Farmers' income is expected to increase by 5 per cent this year, hitting the target set by the central government at the beginning of this year.
Last year, per capita net income of Chinese farmers reached 2,936 yuan (US$362), up 6.8 per cent year on year, and the highest increase since 1997.
Ma also said China would continue to seek fast, steady economic growth in 2012 but more efforts will be made to deal with the challenges brought about by overheating in some industrial sectors  .

Context: prefix = st1 /China's economic growth 'hard to predict'
The worsening global economic situation makes it difficult for Chinato predict its growth for next year, a senior official said on Friday.
""How fast China's economy will grow next year is uncertain,"" Liu He, deputy director of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Finance and Economy Work, told China Daily.
""To a large  _ , the rate will be decided by the external situation,"" Liu said during a discussion with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and other economists in Beijing.
This year, GDP is estimated to grow at 9.4 or 9.5 percent, down from 10.6 percent last year, he said. However, the impact of the current financial turbulence ""on our economy is much less than on the rest of the world"", he said.
Nicholas Stern, a former UK government advisor, also told China Daily it will take at least one or two years for the world to recover from the recession, which is now spreading from the US and the UK to the rest of the world.
""We don't know how long the recession will last, but it is unlikely to be short,"" he said.
Liu said China can use the downturn as an opportunity to restructure its economy, which has relied heavily on government investment, foreign trade and low-cost technology over the past years.
""When the economy is experiencing fast growth, companies are unwilling to upgrade their technologies,"" Liu said.
""The slowdown gives such firms the opportunity to enhance their competitive edge through better technologies.""

Context: TOKYO-- At first glance, Japanese cellphones are young people's favorites, with elegant design and quick access to the Internet. However, despite years of competition in overseas markets, Japan's cellphone makers have little presence beyond the country's shores.
The only Japanese cellphone maker with any meaningful global share is Sony Ericsson, and that company is a London-based joint venture between a Japanese electronics maker and a Swedish telecommunications firm.
And Sony Ericsson has been hit by big losses. Its market share was just 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009, behind Nokia of Finland, Samsung Electronics and LG of South Korea, and Motorola of Illinois.
This year, Mr Natsuno, who developed a popular wireless Internet service called i-Mode, invited some of the best minds in the field to debate how Japanese cellphones could go global.
""The most amazing thing about Japan is that even the average person out there will have a very advanced phone, ""said Mr Natsuno. Japan has 100 million users of advanced third-generation smart phones, twice the number of the United States, a much larger market. Many Japanese rely on their phones, not a PC, for Internet access.
Indeed, Japanese cellphone makers thought they had positioned themselves to dominate the age of digital data. But they were a little too clever. In the 1990s, they set a standard for the second-generation network that was refused everywhere else. Then Japan quickly adopted a third-generation standard in 2001. However, it made Japanese phones too advanced for most markets.
Several Japanese companies are now considering a push into overseas markets, including NEC. Panasonic, Sharp, Toshiba and Fujitsu are said to be planning similar moves.
""Japanese cellphone makers need to either look overseas, or exit the business"", said Kenshi Tazaki, a managing vice president at the consulting firm Gartner Japan. 
 Question:Which of the following would be the best title for the passage? 
A. Japanese cellphone companies are unsuccessful. 
B. Japan has more cellphone users than the US. 
C. Japanese cellphone industry intends to expand overseas markets. 
D. Going global--a difficult task for Japanese companies.

Context: BEIJING -- Rising smartphone star Xiaomi is moving upmarket and taking aim at Apple's iPhone. The Chinese maker known for low-priced phones on Thursday unveiled   a new model that Chairman J un Lei said is comparable to Apple's iPhone 6 but thinner, lighter and much cheaper. The phone starts at 2, 299 yuan ($375), less than half the 5,288 yuan ($ 865) price of an iPhone 6 in China.
Xiaomi, founded in 2010, passed South Korea's SaM:ung Electronics Co. in the second quarter of last year as the best-selling smartphone brand in China by number of phones sold. The company is expanding into India and other developing markets but has yet to announce plans to enter the United States or Europe.
Xiaomi ""is a respected brand that already has an Apple-like following"" in China, said analyst Brian Blair, who tracks mobile device makers at Rosenblatt Securities. Apple is still a relatively small player in China, selling about 45 million iPhones there last year, Blair estimates, but will continue to grow.
""Apple is very much a premium   brand,"" said Blair. ""The company that's more at risk is SaM:ung, which has been losing share in that market.""
Privately held   Xiaomi said last year's sales tripled to 61. 1 million phones and revenue   more than doubled to 74. 3 billion yuan ($12.2 billion). The company, based in Beijing, recently completed a round of fundraising from investors that it said valued Xiaomi at $ 45 billion, making it one of the world's most valuable technology brands.
Xiaomi ran into legal trouble in India in December after a court blocked sales while it hears a complaint by Sweden's LM Ericcson that the Chinese company violated its patents.
In a blog post earlier this month, Lei called the case a ""rite of passage""   for a young company. 
 Question:What's the attitude of Jun Lei towards the case of Xiaomi in India? 
A. Negative. 
B. Satisfied. 
C. Positive. 
D. Doubtful.

""Faster than TV, definitely faster than electricity. More people have access to mobile phones and therefore communication. More people have internet access today in Africa than they have access to water, clean water, or even sanitation .So we can say that this has been the most significant revolution in terms of changing the African landscape and how people live their daily life.""
CNN television recently named seven ways of life it says have been revolutionized because of mobile phones. They include political activism, education, entertainment, disaster management, agriculture and health.
Another area is banking. Reports say half of more of the adults in Gabon, Kenya and Sudan use mobile money. Rene Mendy sells goods in the streets of Dakar, Senegal. But he never had enough money to open a bank account.
Now he uses a mobile phone banking service called Orange Money. With his telephone, he can add or take out as little as one dollar. He can make payments and send money to family members who live far away.
Orange Money says it serves four million customers in ten countries. The World Bank's Samia Melham notes that the French company is facing competition from other mobile banking services.
""The mobile banking is a huge trend. And people in the West don't understand it, because most people have bank accounts and they have credit cards. It-mobile banking-is the instant possession fo cash at a much lower cost. The cost is the cost of sending an SMS, which is almost nothing compared to what traditional transfer agents, like Western Union, would charge-10 dollars or more for a particular money transfer.""

A. seven ways of life revolutionized because of mobile phones 
B. more people having access to clean water

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT.""

A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap 
D. the knives were produced in one factory

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----. 
A. planted less corn 
B. planted morn crops 
C. planted morn wheat 
D. earned more money 
 Answer: D
Context: According to the Small Business Association, more than 50 percent of all small businesses fail within the first five years. This is not the case for Apiary Fund CEO, Shawn Lucas. Shawn has grown a very successful business focusing on teaching people how to trade foreign currencies. The Apiary Fund not only gives their traders some of the best Forex   education possible but also gives their traders money to trade with. The Apiary Fund had a slow start but has now become a company that recently hit $1 billion in trader volume  . The Apiary Fund's success has come from the great business concept, and work ethic  .
* Business Concept
The Apiary Fund has a very special but effective business concept, which Shawn Lucas discovered many years ago. You are probably wondering, where did this business concept come from? Shawn, while working as a Financial Advisor, received a phone call one day from a man he hadn't ever spoken to before. The man asked Shawn to go with him to China to do an analysis of a Chinese company's trading systems. The company at the time was under investigation for a possible violation   of intellectual property rights. He agreed to go and before he knew it he was on a plane to China.
During the analysis of this Chinese company Shawn noticed the company had a very effective business method. He noticed that the risk manager had created a system that protected the company from rarely posting a losing day. The risk manager made this all possible by putting restrictions on the amount a trader could lose. If one of the traders lost even a small amount the risk manager would then be notified  .
Shawn left China with a business concept that would later consume much of his life. After returning home, Shawn was devoted to creating a similar risk management system as the Chinese company had created. That risk management system turned into a successful business called the Apiary Fund.
* Work Ethic
The business concept alone didn't magically make the Apiary Fund into a booming business. The Apiary Fund became successful from hard work and devotion. This hard work and devotion has recently brought the Apiary Fund to hit a trading volume high of $1 billion. Shawn Lucas believes that by the end of this year the Apiary Fund can expect to see double or triple that volume. The company has experienced immense growth by making a few changes to their program structure, which has since increased growth by about five times within the last year.
Successful businesses are hard to start, but with a good business concept and great work ethic anything is possible. Shawn and the Apiary Fund are a great example of both. 
 Question:What does Shawn's business do? 
A. Trading with foreigners. 
B. Lend money to those who need it. 
C. Help people to found their own business. 
D. Teach people how to trade foreign currencies.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption

Context: Decreasing grain prices along with growing costs of production means Chinese farmers are unlikely to see a significant rise in income next year. [:ZXXK]
China's economic planning chief Ma Kai expressed the concern as the government undertakes an ambitious program to improve rural people's lives.
Grain prices have been dropping since April; and prices of wheat, corn and rice fell 5 per cent from August to October compared with the same period last year, Ma, minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, told an annual meeting on development and reform held over the weekend.
Meanwhile, prices of production materials rose 9.1 per cent year on year during the first 10 months.
The situation makes it difficult to achieve a ""new socialist countryside,"" which was last week highlighted as a new concept and ""common action"" of the whole Party and nation.
Vice-Minister of Agriculture Yin Chengjie also said China's entry to the World Trade Organization also creates _ for income rises for the country's 780 million farmers.
Farmers' income is expected to increase by 5 per cent this year, hitting the target set by the central government at the beginning of this year.
Last year, per capita net income of Chinese farmers reached 2,936 yuan (US$362), up 6.8 per cent year on year, and the highest increase since 1997.
Ma also said China would continue to seek fast, steady economic growth in 2012 but more efforts will be made to deal with the challenges brought about by overheating in some industrial sectors  .
(from China Daily, December 5, 2011) 
 Question:From1997 to 2011, the highest increase in farmers' income was achieved in   _  . 
A. 2009 
B. 2010 
C. 2011 
D. 2008

Context: Supply and demand is perhaps one of the most basic concepts of economics and it is the backbone of a market economy. Demand refers to how much of a product or service is desired by buyers. The quantity demanded is the amount of a product people are willing to buy at a certain price; the relationship between price and quantity demanded is known as the demand relationship. Supply represents how much the market can offer. The quantity supplied refers to the amount of a certain goods producers are willing to supply when receiving a certain price. The relationship between price and how much of a goods or service is supplied to the market is known as the supply relationship. Price, therefore, is a reflection of supply and demand.
   The law of demand states that, if all other factors remain equal, the higher the price of a product, the fewer people will demand that product. The amount of goods that buyers purchase at a higher price is less as the price of a product goes up, so does the opportunity cost of buying that product.
   Like the law of demand, the law of supply shows the quantities that will be sold at a certain price. But unlike the law of demand, the supply relationship shows an upward slope. This means that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. Producers supply more at a higher price because selling a higher quantity at a higher price increases the whole income.
   Now that we know the laws of supply and demand, let's turn to an example to show how supply and demand affect price.
   Imagine that a CD of your favorite band is sold for $20. Because the record company's previous analysis showed that consumers will not demand CDs at a price higher than $20, only ten CDs were sold because the opportunity cost is too high for suppliers to produce more. If, however, the ten CDs are demanded by 20 people, the price will then rise. As a result, the rise in price should cause more CDs to be supplied as the supply relationship shows that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. If, however, there are 30 CDs produced and demand is still at 20, the price will not be pushed up because the supply is more than the demand. 
 Question:We know from the passage that changes in the prices of product cause changes in   _  . 
A. income and expense 
B. invention and production 
C. market and society 
D. supply and demand

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B
Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair.

He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.

Mr.Hennequin's recipe for revival  is to be more open about his company's operations, to be ""locally relevant"", and to improve the experience of visiting his 6.400 restaurants. McDonaId's is blamed for making people fat, exploiting workers, treating animals cruelly, polluting the environment and simply for being American.Mr.Hennequin says he wants to engage in a dialogue with the public to address these concerns.
He introduced ""open door"" visitor days in each country which became hugely popular.In Poland alone some 50,000 visitors came to McDonaId's through the visitors' program last year.The Nutrition Information Initiative launched last year, put detailed Sables on McDonaId's packaging with data on calories, protein, fat, carbohy drates and salt content, ""the details are also printed on tray-liners.

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----. 
A. planted less corn 
B. planted morn crops 
C. planted morn wheat

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT.""

Context: BEIJING -- Rising smartphone star Xiaomi is moving upmarket and taking aim at Apple's iPhone. The Chinese maker known for low-priced phones on Thursday unveiled   a new model that Chairman J un Lei said is comparable to Apple's iPhone 6 but thinner, lighter and much cheaper. The phone starts at 2, 299 yuan ($375), less than half the 5,288 yuan ($ 865) price of an iPhone 6 in China.
Xiaomi, founded in 2010, passed South Korea's SaM:ung Electronics Co. in the second quarter of last year as the best-selling smartphone brand in China by number of phones sold. The company is expanding into India and other developing markets but has yet to announce plans to enter the United States or Europe.
Xiaomi ""is a respected brand that already has an Apple-like following"" in China, said analyst Brian Blair, who tracks mobile device makers at Rosenblatt Securities. Apple is still a relatively small player in China, selling about 45 million iPhones there last year, Blair estimates, but will continue to grow.
""Apple is very much a premium   brand,"" said Blair. ""The company that's more at risk is SaM:ung, which has been losing share in that market.""
Privately held   Xiaomi said last year's sales tripled to 61. 1 million phones and revenue   more than doubled to 74. 3 billion yuan ($12.2 billion). The company, based in Beijing, recently completed a round of fundraising from investors that it said valued Xiaomi at $ 45 billion, making it one of the world's most valuable technology brands.
Xiaomi ran into legal trouble in India in December after a court blocked sales while it hears a complaint by Sweden's LM Ericcson that the Chinese company violated its patents.
In a blog post earlier this month, Lei called the case a ""rite of passage""   for a young company. 
 Question:What's the attitude of Jun Lei towards the case of Xiaomi in India? 
A. Negative. 
B. Satisfied. 
C. Positive. 
D. Doubtful. 
 Answer: C
Context: TOKYO-- At first glance, Japanese cellphones are young people's favorites, with elegant design and quick access to the Internet. However, despite years of competition in overseas markets, Japan's cellphone makers have little presence beyond the country's shores.
The only Japanese cellphone maker with any meaningful global share is Sony Ericsson, and that company is a London-based joint venture between a Japanese electronics maker and a Swedish telecommunications firm.
And Sony Ericsson has been hit by big losses. Its market share was just 6.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009, behind Nokia of Finland, Samsung Electronics and LG of South Korea, and Motorola of Illinois.
This year, Mr Natsuno, who developed a popular wireless Internet service called i-Mode, invited some of the best minds in the field to debate how Japanese cellphones could go global.
""The most amazing thing about Japan is that even the average person out there will have a very advanced phone, ""said Mr Natsuno. Japan has 100 million users of advanced third-generation smart phones, twice the number of the United States, a much larger market. Many Japanese rely on their phones, not a PC, for Internet access.
Indeed, Japanese cellphone makers thought they had positioned themselves to dominate the age of digital data. But they were a little too clever. In the 1990s, they set a standard for the second-generation network that was refused everywhere else. Then Japan quickly adopted a third-generation standard in 2001. However, it made Japanese phones too advanced for most markets.
Several Japanese companies are now considering a push into overseas markets, including NEC. Panasonic, Sharp, Toshiba and Fujitsu are said to be planning similar moves.
""Japanese cellphone makers need to either look overseas, or exit the business"", said Kenshi Tazaki, a managing vice president at the consulting firm Gartner Japan. 
 Question:Which of the following would be the best title for the passage? 
A. Japanese cellphone companies are unsuccessful. 
B. Japan has more cellphone users than the US. 
C. Japanese cellphone industry intends to expand overseas markets. 
D. Going global--a difficult task for Japanese companies.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----. 
A. planted less corn 
B. planted morn crops 
C. planted morn wheat

Context: Supply and demand is perhaps one of the most basic concepts of economics and it is the backbone of a market economy. Demand refers to how much of a product or service is desired by buyers. The quantity demanded is the amount of a product people are willing to buy at a certain price; the relationship between price and quantity demanded is known as the demand relationship. Supply represents how much the market can offer. The quantity supplied refers to the amount of a certain goods producers are willing to supply when receiving a certain price. The relationship between price and how much of a goods or service is supplied to the market is known as the supply relationship. Price, therefore, is a reflection of supply and demand.
   The law of demand states that, if all other factors remain equal, the higher the price of a product, the fewer people will demand that product. The amount of goods that buyers purchase at a higher price is less as the price of a product goes up, so does the opportunity cost of buying that product.
   Like the law of demand, the law of supply shows the quantities that will be sold at a certain price. But unlike the law of demand, the supply relationship shows an upward slope. This means that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. Producers supply more at a higher price because selling a higher quantity at a higher price increases the whole income.
   Now that we know the laws of supply and demand, let's turn to an example to show how supply and demand affect price.
   Imagine that a CD of your favorite band is sold for $20. Because the record company's previous analysis showed that consumers will not demand CDs at a price higher than $20, only ten CDs were sold because the opportunity cost is too high for suppliers to produce more. If, however, the ten CDs are demanded by 20 people, the price will then rise. As a result, the rise in price should cause more CDs to be supplied as the supply relationship shows that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. If, however, there are 30 CDs produced and demand is still at 20, the price will not be pushed up because the supply is more than the demand. 
 Question:We know from the passage that changes in the prices of product cause changes in   _  . 
A. income and expense 
B. invention and production 
C. market and society 
D. supply and demand 
 Answer: D
Context: The rapid growth of Smartphones and electronic tablets is making the Internet favourite for Americans reading news, a report said.
News consumption online increased 17% last year from the year before. Television news, newspapers, radio and magazines all lost audience last year. For the first time, the number of people who get news online at least three times a week is larger than the number of people who get news from the newspapers. TV news has been the most popular since the 1960s. It has replaced the afternoon newspapers. But now the online news seems to be more popular than the TV news.
People are used to having the Internet available on phones or small tablets. In December, 2010, 41% of Americans said they got most of their news on the Internet, more than double the 17% who said that a year earlier, the report said. In January, 2011, 7% of Americans owned electronic tablets, nearly double what it was three months earlier. It was the fastest-growing new digital technology, ahead of mobile phones when they were introduced. The online ad income was expected to surpass print newspaper ad income for the first time in 2010.
The news business used to be the intermediary . You needed newspapers and TV stations to reach your customers. In this age of the computer, it's the software developers that you need. 
 Question:About   _   % of Americans got most of their news on the Internet in 2009.

 Answer: B
Context: The price of milk may be going up. There was not enough rain in some parts of the country last year and the bad weather may mean that a gallon   of milk will cost 41 cents more after October 1st.
California already has high milk prices and the California court does not want the price to go any higher. High milk prices will be very hard for some people. Families with many children will have to spend more money to buy milk. The poor and older people without much money will also be hurt by higher prices.
The court said that more milk from other states should be sold in California as the price of milk from other states is not as high. Some states got enough rain so their costs did not go up. People will then be able to buy the cheaper milk, meaning that unless milk producers bring their milk prices down, their milk will not sell.
The drought   around the country has meant market forces are likely to push milk prices up by as much as 41-cent a gallon by October 1st. Experts said this decision by the Californian court could reduce   the effect of the price rise here.
The 41-cent increase would add to California's already high milk prices so California must allow more milk producers from outside the state to sell their products there. This would then lead to increased supplies  , which would, as a result, stop milk prices from increasing. 
 Question:What caused milk prices in California to increase? 
A. Short supplies from other states. 
B. Being short of rain. 
C. The California court. 
D. Children's need for milk.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT."" 
 Question:The price of the knives was cut down by half because   _  . 
A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap 
D. the knives were produced in one factory 
 Answer: B
Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption

Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.

Context: It is a matter of common observation that although money income keeps going up over the years, we never seem to become richer. Prices are rising continuously. This condition is what we call inflation: the money supply is becoming inflated so that each unit of it becomes less valuable. We have got used to higher and higher rates of inflation in recent years. What could be bought twenty years ago for one pound now costs well over 2 pounds. And at present this rate of inflation seems to be rising rather than falling. If in the real world our money incomes go up at the same rate as prices do. One might think that inflation doesn't matter. _ When money is losing value it also loses one of the qualities of a good money--stability of value. It is no longer acceptable as a store of value; and it becomes an unsuitable means of delayed payment. Nobody wants to hold a wasting possession, so people try to get rid of money as quickly as possible. Inflation therefore simply stimulates our spending and discourages saving. 
 Question:.We can conclude according to the passage that   _  . 
A. the writer is a government official 
B. the writer is worried about inflation 
C. the writer encourages people to spend money 
D. the writer has become richer because of inflation

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer

Context: Frank Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York., in 1852. His family were very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for showing goods to attract people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends ( ) for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said five cents each. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store., selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1000 stores in the US and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always run his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: "" The customer is always right.""

Context: It is a matter of common observation that although money income keeps going up over the years, we never seem to become richer. Prices are rising continuously. This condition is what we call inflation: the money supply is becoming inflated so that each unit of it becomes less valuable. We have got used to higher and higher rates of inflation in recent years. What could be bought twenty years ago for one pound now costs well over 2 pounds. And at present this rate of inflation seems to be rising rather than falling. If in the real world our money incomes go up at the same rate as prices do. One might think that inflation doesn't matter. _ When money is losing value it also loses one of the qualities of a good money--stability of value. It is no longer acceptable as a store of value; and it becomes an unsuitable means of delayed payment. Nobody wants to hold a wasting possession, so people try to get rid of money as quickly as possible. Inflation therefore simply stimulates our spending and discourages saving. 
 Question:.We can conclude according to the passage that   _  . 
A. the writer is a government official 
B. the writer is worried about inflation 
C. the writer encourages people to spend money 
D. the writer has become richer because of inflation

Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.

Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or

Context: China's economic growth ""hard to predict""
The worsening global economic situation makes it difficult for China to predict its growth for next year, a senior official said on Friday.
""How fast China's economy will grow next year is uncertain,"" Liu He, deputy director of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Finance and Economy Work, told China Daily.
""To a large
, the rate will be decided by the external  situation,"" Liu said during a discussion with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and other economists in Beijing.
""This year, GDP is estimated to grow at 9.4 or 9.5 percent, down from 10.6 percent last year,"" he said. ""However, the impact of the current financial turbulence on our economy is much less than on the rest of the world.""
Nicholas Stern, a former UK government advisor, also told China Daily it will take at least one or two years for the world to recover from the recession, which is now spreading from the US and the UK to the rest of the world.
""We don't know how long the recession will last, but it is unlikely to be short,"" he said.
Liu said China can use the downturn  as an opportunity to restructure its economy, which has relied heavily on government investment, foreign trade and low-cost technology over the past years.
""When the economy is experiencing fast growth, companies are unwilling to upgrade their technologies,"" Liu said.
""The slowdown gives such firms the opportunity to enhance  their competitive edge through better technologies.""

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----. 
A. planted less corn 
B. planted morn crops 
C. planted morn wheat 
D. earned more money 
 Answer: D
Context: Decreasing grain prices along with growing costs of production means Chinese farmers are unlikely to see a significant rise in income next year. [:ZXXK]
China's economic planning chief Ma Kai expressed the concern as the government undertakes an ambitious program to improve rural people's lives.
Grain prices have been dropping since April; and prices of wheat, corn and rice fell 5 per cent from August to October compared with the same period last year, Ma, minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, told an annual meeting on development and reform held over the weekend.
Meanwhile, prices of production materials rose 9.1 per cent year on year during the first 10 months.
The situation makes it difficult to achieve a ""new socialist countryside,"" which was last week highlighted as a new concept and ""common action"" of the whole Party and nation.
Vice-Minister of Agriculture Yin Chengjie also said China's entry to the World Trade Organization also creates _ for income rises for the country's 780 million farmers.
Farmers' income is expected to increase by 5 per cent this year, hitting the target set by the central government at the beginning of this year.
Last year, per capita net income of Chinese farmers reached 2,936 yuan (US$362), up 6.8 per cent year on year, and the highest increase since 1997.
Ma also said China would continue to seek fast, steady economic growth in 2012 but more efforts will be made to deal with the challenges brought about by overheating in some industrial sectors  .
(from China Daily, December 5, 2011) 
 Question:From1997 to 2011, the highest increase in farmers' income was achieved in   _  . 
A. 2009

Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .

A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle.

A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer

Context: Decreasing grain prices along with growing costs of production means Chinese farmers are unlikely to see a significant rise in income next year. [:ZXXK]
China's economic planning chief Ma Kai expressed the concern as the government undertakes an ambitious program to improve rural people's lives.
Grain prices have been dropping since April; and prices of wheat, corn and rice fell 5 per cent from August to October compared with the same period last year, Ma, minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, told an annual meeting on development and reform held over the weekend.
Meanwhile, prices of production materials rose 9.1 per cent year on year during the first 10 months.
The situation makes it difficult to achieve a ""new socialist countryside,"" which was last week highlighted as a new concept and ""common action"" of the whole Party and nation.
Vice-Minister of Agriculture Yin Chengjie also said China's entry to the World Trade Organization also creates _ for income rises for the country's 780 million farmers.
Farmers' income is expected to increase by 5 per cent this year, hitting the target set by the central government at the beginning of this year.
Last year, per capita net income of Chinese farmers reached 2,936 yuan (US$362), up 6.8 per cent year on year, and the highest increase since 1997.
Ma also said China would continue to seek fast, steady economic growth in 2012 but more efforts will be made to deal with the challenges brought about by overheating in some industrial sectors  .

Context: The organization representing British universities has expressed concern about the potential effect of tuition fees after figures showed a drop of more than 6% in student applications with less than a month to go before the deadline for 2013 applications.
Data from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) showed there were 265,784 university applications by UK-based candiates up to 17 Decemeber, 6.3% down on the parallel period in the admissions cycle the year before. While this is less than the 8.4% year-on-uear fall seen in earlier Ucas figures, released in mid-November, the coming January deadline makes it ever more likely that the total 2013 applicant figure will see a second sizeable fall following the introduction of annual fees of up to PS9,000.
Nicola Dandridge, the chairman of Universities UK, said : ""However, we must be concerned about any drops in the numbers applying to university and in particular, we must look closely at how the increase in graduate contributions in England may be affecting the decisions of promising students. However ,the December figures show a drop in numbers across the UK, suggesting that it is not only a question of tuition fees in England putting off from applying.""
A report of the Uncas figures to mid-December shows a 6.5% fall for applicants in England and 11.7% for those in Wales, with smaller drops of 3.9% for Scotland and 0.5% for Nortern Ireland. Scotiish students at home insitiutions pay on fees, while those from Nothern Ireland have fees capped to PS3,575 for Northern Irish universities.
Dandridge added: ""No one should be put off applying to university because of worries about finance.""
""It is important that no one is put off applying to university because they do not have information about the student support available to them. Most new students don't need to pay directly. There will be more financial support for those from poorer families and everyone will make lower loan repayments thatn they do now once they are in well paid jobs."" 
 Question:Compared with the previous year, the fall in student applications is  _  . 
A. 3.9% 
B. 6% 
C. 6.3% 
D. 8.4% 
 Answer: C
Context: It is a matter of common observation that although money income keeps going up over the years, we never seem to become richer. Prices are rising continuously. This condition is what we call inflation: the money supply is becoming inflated so that each unit of it becomes less valuable. We have got used to higher and higher rates of inflation in recent years. What could be bought twenty years ago for one pound now costs well over 2 pounds. And at present this rate of inflation seems to be rising rather than falling. If in the real world our money incomes go up at the same rate as prices do. One might think that inflation doesn't matter. _ When money is losing value it also loses one of the qualities of a good money--stability of value. It is no longer acceptable as a store of value; and it becomes an unsuitable means of delayed payment. Nobody wants to hold a wasting possession, so people try to get rid of money as quickly as possible. Inflation therefore simply stimulates our spending and discourages saving. 
 Question:.We can conclude according to the passage that   _  . 
A. the writer is a government official 
B. the writer is worried about inflation 
C. the writer encourages people to spend money 
D. the writer has become richer because of inflation

Context: An environment group called the Food Commission is unhappy and disappointed because of the sales of bottled water from Japan. The water, it angrily argues in public, has traveled 10,000 "" _ "" before it reaches Western customers. ""Transporting water half-way across the world is surely the extremely stupid use of fuel when there is plenty of water in the UK."" It is also worried that we are wasting our fuel by buying prawns from Indonesia (7,000 food miles) and carrots from South Africa (5,900 food miles).
Counting the number of miles traveled by a product is a strange way of trying to tell the true situation of the environmental damage done by an industry. Most food is transported around the world on container ships that are extremely energy-efficient. It should be noted that a ton of butter transported 25 miles in a truck to a farmers' market does not necessarily use less fuel on its journey than a similar product transported hundreds of miles by sea, Besides, the idea of ""food miles"" ignores the amount of fuel used in the production. It is possible to cut down your food miles by buying tomatoes grown in Britain rather than those grown in Ghana; the difference is that the British ones will have been raised in heated greenhouses and the Ghanaian ones in the open sun.
What is the idea of ""food miles"" does provide, however, is the chance to cut out Third World countries from First World food markets. The number of miles traveled by our food should, as I see it, be regarded as a sign of the success of the global trade system, not a sign of damage to the environment. 
 Question:By comparing tomatoes raised in Britain and in Ghana, the author tries to explain that  _  . 
A. British tomatoes are healthier than Ghanaian ones 
B. Ghanaian tomatoes taste better than British ones 
C. cutting down food miles may not necessarily save fuel

Context: As the saying goes, man struggles upwards; water flows downwards. Water runs downhill from mountaintops to streams to rivers to oceans. But downhill isn't the only way that water moves .A new study measures how water travels from country to country for human consumption. This flow isn't the type we usually think about .These scientists looked at the water used to grow and make the products which get shipped from nation to nation as imports or exports. They call this a flow of ""virtual water "".
We typically think about water as the liquid that flows from a tap. However,92%of the water used by people goes into growing crops,according to water researcher Arjen Hoekstra. He recently studied the hidden travels of virtual water used in products made from things like crops and meats .These products are shipped around the world.
For example, consider a sugary soft drink. Hoekstra estimated that to produce one half-liter of the drink requires between 170 and 310liters of the water--about 95%--is used to grow and process the ingredients .Another 4%goes into the packaging and labeling. In Hoekstra's calculation, when one country produces a half-liter of soda and sells it abroad,it exports as much virtual water as would fill a large refrigerator.
According to Hoekstra's new report,dry countries like Israel and Kuwait,both in the Middle East,get the majority of their virtual water from other countries,through imported products. More surprisingly, some wetter countries,like the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, also get the majority of their virtual water from other places. That means that most of the water used to grow or produce the products and food consumed in those countries came from other countries.
In the United States most of the virtual water used comes from American sources .In China even less of the water associated with its products.

Context: Poor families in some countries spend as much as eighty percent of their money on food. Rising prices in recent months have created the worst food crisis  in more than thirty years. The United Nations World Food Program says high food prices could push one hundred million people into hunger.
Nathan Childs is an expert on rice markets. He notes that the harvest for the latest growing season was the largest on record. But India, Vietnam and others have restricted exports  to keep prices down at home and protect supplies.
Thailand's agriculture minister says his country will never restrict rice exports. He told the Reuters news agency Thursday that Thailand has enough supplies to meet demand at home and for export.
Thailand is the world's largest rice exporter. Recent signs of an increase in supplies have helped ease record prices for Thai rice. Prices rose last week above one thousand dollars a ton.
Vietnam, the second biggest exporter, has banned  exports until June. And Vietnamese officials have now warned that non-food traders who buy rice for speculation will be severely punished.
Some experts say speculation is a necessary part of market activity. But the head of the U.N. Environment Program blames it for the high food prices. ""We have enough food on this planet today to feed everyone."" Achim Steiner told the Associated Press.
Earlier, a member of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission didn't accept the idea that speculators are the main cause. Bart Chilton blamed reduced harvests and grain supplies and the falling value of the dollar.
U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called heads of major international agencies to a meeting this week in the Swiss capital, Bern. He says high food prices could harm world trade, economic growth, social progress and political security. 
 Question:What is the main idea of the passage? 
A. Vietnam has banned rice exports to other countries. 
B. Thailand is the largest rice exporter in the world. 
C. Some families are too poor to afford enough food. 
D. Rising prices of food have led to the world food crisis.

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B

Context: prefix = st1 /China's economic growth 'hard to predict'
The worsening global economic situation makes it difficult for Chinato predict its growth for next year, a senior official said on Friday.
""How fast China's economy will grow next year is uncertain,"" Liu He, deputy director of the Office of the Central Leading Group on Finance and Economy Work, told China Daily.
""To a large  _ , the rate will be decided by the external situation,"" Liu said during a discussion with Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and other economists in Beijing.
This year, GDP is estimated to grow at 9.4 or 9.5 percent, down from 10.6 percent last year, he said. However, the impact of the current financial turbulence ""on our economy is much less than on the rest of the world"", he said.
Nicholas Stern, a former UK government advisor, also told China Daily it will take at least one or two years for the world to recover from the recession, which is now spreading from the US and the UK to the rest of the world.
""We don't know how long the recession will last, but it is unlikely to be short,"" he said.
Liu said China can use the downturn as an opportunity to restructure its economy, which has relied heavily on government investment, foreign trade and low-cost technology over the past years.
""When the economy is experiencing fast growth, companies are unwilling to upgrade their technologies,"" Liu said.
""The slowdown gives such firms the opportunity to enhance their competitive edge through better technologies.""
From ChinaDaily 2008-10-25 
 Question:According to the passage, the reason why Liu said this downturn is an opportunity for Chinato restructure its economy is that   _  . 
A. China's economy will not depend on government investment in the future 
B. Foreign trade will grow in the future 
C. The downturn will forceChina's companies to upgrade their technologies 
D. Low-cost technologies will not exist inChina

Context: A U.S. dad quit his job, giving up a massive salary, after his 10-year-old daughter gave him a 22-point list outlining all the events he missed so far during the year. As the CEO of the $2 trillion global investment fund PIMCO, Mohamed El-Erian shocked the finance industry when he quit in January.
El-Erian said it was about a year ago when he was repeatedly asking his daughter to brush her teeth, but she wasn't listening. When he asked her why, she responded with a list of 22 milestones he had missed: like the first day of school and the first soccer game of the season.
""And the school year wasn't yet over,"" El-Erian wrote. ""I felt awful and got defensive: I had a good excuse for each missed event! Travel, important meetings, and urgent phone call, sudden to-dos. But it dawned on me that I was missing an infinitely more important point. My work-life balance had gotten out of whack, and the imbalance was hurting my very special relationship with my daughter. I was not making enough time for her."" El-Erian explained he was struggling with the same thing so many parents do--work-life balance.
Dads who are quitting their profit-making jobs to improve work-life balance is a subject that is getting more traction as some high-profile executive have recently written about their experiences.
Last month, former MongoDB CEO Max Schireson wrote a blog post for Time about his decision to step down from the company's top job. He wrote that he struggled to make time for his three children because he was flying around half a million kilometres a year for work.
""I was not with my kids when our puppy was hit by a car, or when my son had an emergency surgery,"" Schireson wrote.
On an overnight flight to Texas he woke up in Arizona to discover the plane made an emergency landing and some traumatized crew members had to be replaced. He decided it was time to address his work-life balance.
Quitting is something El-Erian and Schireson were financially able to do, but El-Erian recognizes most people don't have this luxury. He hopes companies will pay attention to improving work-life balance for their employees.
El-Erian now manages ""a portfolio of part-time jobs"" that don't require as much travel. He alternates mornings with his wife taking their daughter to school and he often picks her up from school.
""So far, it's been the right decision for me,"" he wrote. ""I'm so grateful that this is providing me greater opportunity to experience key moments in my daughter's life before they're all too quickly gone."" 
 Question:El-Erian resigned from PIMCO mainly because   _  . 
A. his daughter has been missing him badly 
B. he was getting bored with the endless flights 
C. he hoped to get his daughter to listen to her 
D. he wanted to experience his daughter's milestones

Context: The organization representing British universities has expressed concern about the potential effect of tuition fees after figures showed a drop of more than 6% in student applications with less than a month to go before the deadline for 2013 applications.
Data from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) showed there were 265,784 university applications by UK-based candiates up to 17 Decemeber, 6.3% down on the parallel period in the admissions cycle the year before. While this is less than the 8.4% year-on-uear fall seen in earlier Ucas figures, released in mid-November, the coming January deadline makes it ever more likely that the total 2013 applicant figure will see a second sizeable fall following the introduction of annual fees of up to PS9,000.
Nicola Dandridge, the chairman of Universities UK, said : ""However, we must be concerned about any drops in the numbers applying to university and in particular, we must look closely at how the increase in graduate contributions in England may be affecting the decisions of promising students. However ,the December figures show a drop in numbers across the UK, suggesting that it is not only a question of tuition fees in England putting off from applying.""
A report of the Uncas figures to mid-December shows a 6.5% fall for applicants in England and 11.7% for those in Wales, with smaller drops of 3.9% for Scotland and 0.5% for Nortern Ireland. Scotiish students at home insitiutions pay on fees, while those from Nothern Ireland have fees capped to PS3,575 for Northern Irish universities.
Dandridge added: ""No one should be put off applying to university because of worries about finance.""
""It is important that no one is put off applying to university because they do not have information about the student support available to them. Most new students don't need to pay directly. There will be more financial support for those from poorer families and everyone will make lower loan repayments thatn they do now once they are in well paid jobs.""

A. 3.9% 
B. 6% 
C. 6.3%

Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----. 
A. planted less corn 
B. planted morn crops 
C. planted morn wheat 
D. earned more money

Context: It is ""one of the few bright spots in the Chinese economy,"" says Zeng Ming. He is talking about e-commerce. Mr Zeng, the chief strategy officer for Alibaba, a giant Chinese Internet firm, predicts that digital transactions on his firm's platforms will top l trillion yuan ($159 billion) this year-more than Amazon's and eBay's combined. That is a bold claim, but consider what happened on Singles Sunday.
Invented a few years ago by students and seized upon by digital marketers, this festival for lonely hearts falls annually on the  llth day of the llth month (since l is the loneliest number).It is like St Valentine's Day, only worse. Singletons shower each other with tender gifts: a barrage of pearls; a storm of sweets.
This November llth they spent a surprising 19 billion yuan on Alibaba's online platforms-a fourfold increase on a year ago, and more than double what Americans spent online last Cyber Monday (the Monday after Thanksgiving, when retailers urge Americans to shop online). About 100m purchases were logged, accounting for 80% of the packages shipped that day. Couriers  were buried in parcels.
So life is good for China's e-tailers, then? Not exactly. The number of digital marketers is increasing and online sales are booming. Consumers are enjoying lower prices, better service and more variety. The problem? The pressure on profits in Chinese e-commerce is worse than in America, reckons Elinor Leung of CLSA, a broker. ""Almost no one makes money,"" she says.
The fiercest battles are being fought between online retailers and their bricks-and-mortar  rivals.Dangdang, a firm. that resembles Amazon,.and 360buy, another online retailer, have cut prices fiercely. Tencent, a cash-rich online giant known for its instant-messaging software, is splashing out to win market share. 360buy has also just raised $400m from investors to do the same. But it is unclear how much longer such firms can burn through capital. 
 Question:How many packages were shipped on November ll th from Alibaba's online platforms? 
A. About 80 million. 
B. About 100 million. 
C. About 125 million. 
D. About 180 million.

Context: ""We don't necessarily believe that new advertising, which might make consumers feel better about the Coke brand or better about the ads themselves , will actually result in consumers consuming more of the product,"" Morgan Stanley's Bill Pecoriello wrote in a research note the days after the investor   meeting . But Coke is optimistic it can regain its old magic, and is banking on a new slogan: ""Welcome to the Coke side of life.""
BREAK THROUGH HIT? 
With PepsiCo about to surpass  Coke as the beverage king on Wall Street--Pepsi's market capitalization has  _ in recent years to $97.9 billion, putting it less than a billion dollars behind its rival--the heat is on Coke . It's set to launch a new marketing campaign in March, 2006. And having taken a quick look at Coke's investor presentation on Dec. 7 in New York, my sense is that Coke may be moving in the right direction .
Given the continued shift by consumers away from soda--Coke's stronghold --and into alternative beverages like juice, tea, and water, Coke badly needs a breakthrough hit. And given that shift away from soda, some analyists wonder whether even the catchiest new ads will be enough to put the fizz back into Coke.
SAME OLD, UPDATED?
    The new flavors of PowerAde sports drink will probably enable Coke to continue stealing market share from PepsiCo's Gatorade brand. And Coke is getting a little more creative with packaging, including new, aluminum bottles of Coke that will be sold in nightclubs, and an 8.4-ounce ""100 calorie"" version of its flagship Coke that will appeal to women who want fewer calories and will like the fact that the small can will fit in their purse. I doubt whether other new products will be successful, including a new coffee-flavored soda called Coke-Cola Black that I tried. Think carbonated coffee. But I'm not sure if the product, which Coke is pitching as an afternoon pick-me-up for the 35-and-over set, is going to pull people away from their afternoon Frappucino fix. And my opinion is that Vault, an orange-flavored energy drink, will have just as much trouble unseating Mountain Dew among teens as did Coke's last attempt, a product called Surge.
If there is one concern I have about the fresh offerings Coke plans to launch this year, it appears that many of them are simply new brands, not new products. 
 Question:According to the passage, we can know that   _  . 
A. Coke mainly depends on new products recently 
B. Nowadays Coke is comparatively less popular 
C. PepsiCo has taken the place of Coke 
D. Coke has few new brands

Context: Supply and demand is perhaps one of the most basic concepts of economics and it is the backbone of a market economy. Demand refers to how much of a product or service is desired by buyers. The quantity demanded is the amount of a product people are willing to buy at a certain price; the relationship between price and quantity demanded is known as the demand relationship. Supply represents how much the market can offer. The quantity supplied refers to the amount of a certain goods producers are willing to supply when receiving a certain price. The relationship between price and how much of a goods or service is supplied to the market is known as the supply relationship. Price, therefore, is a reflection of supply and demand.
   The law of demand states that, if all other factors remain equal, the higher the price of a product, the fewer people will demand that product. The amount of goods that buyers purchase at a higher price is less as the price of a product goes up, so does the opportunity cost of buying that product.
   Like the law of demand, the law of supply shows the quantities that will be sold at a certain price. But unlike the law of demand, the supply relationship shows an upward slope. This means that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. Producers supply more at a higher price because selling a higher quantity at a higher price increases the whole income.
   Now that we know the laws of supply and demand, let's turn to an example to show how supply and demand affect price.
   Imagine that a CD of your favorite band is sold for $20. Because the record company's previous analysis showed that consumers will not demand CDs at a price higher than $20, only ten CDs were sold because the opportunity cost is too high for suppliers to produce more. If, however, the ten CDs are demanded by 20 people, the price will then rise. As a result, the rise in price should cause more CDs to be supplied as the supply relationship shows that the higher the price, the higher the quantity supplied. If, however, there are 30 CDs produced and demand is still at 20, the price will not be pushed up because the supply is more than the demand. 
 Question:We know from the passage that changes in the prices of product cause changes in   _  . 
A. income and expense 
B. invention and production 
C. market and society 
D. supply and demand 
 Answer: D
Context: As Apple tries to maintain its growth and success in China, the world's largest smart-phone market is becoming even more critical. Apple's shares  fell sharply as the company's earnings for the holiday quarter through December disappointed investors.
The sales of the iPhone, which include both the iPhone 5 and older models, came in at the low end of analysts' expectations, while the company's income plan for the second quarter was below analysts' forecasts, though Apple is known to give conservative   forecasts.
Som'6 analysts have said that for Apple to regain its growth, the company.needs a more aggressive strategy for markets, or more specifically for China, where the market for smart phones has been expanding more rapidly than anywhere else. In China, demand is particularly great for inexpensive phones that run on Android  operating system, sold by many Chinese phone makers as well as South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co.
But Apple says it's already enjoying strong growth in China. ""We saw big growth in iPhones,""Chief Executive Tim Cook said. He said that the company has been quickly expanding its sales channels in China, including the number of Apple stores. ""This isn't nearly what we need, we're not even close to that, but we're making great progress. "" he said.
In China, a big missing piece for Apple is China Mobile Ltd. , the biggest local telecom carrier that doesn't yet sell the iPhone. Earlier this month, Mr. Cook met China Mobile Chairman Xi Guohua in Beijing and discussed cooperation, stirring hopes that the world's largest mobile carrier may soon start offering the iPhone.
Earlier this month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is working on a lower-end iPhone that could launch as early as this year. But one possible challenge for Apple in China is that low-pricod Android-based phones are getting better in terms of quality. A report from CLSA in late November showed that many smart-phones sold at about 1,000 yuan ( $160) came with higher-reso-lution screens, better cameras and more powerful processors than phones at that price did a year earlier. 
 Question:What can we learn from the passage? 
A. Apple tends to offer a lower sales forecast. 
B. China Mobile Ltd began to team up with Apple. 
C. Cook is pessimistic about what Apple did in China. 
D. Apple didn't take measures to develop Chinese market.

Context: Is it time to kick Russia out of the BRICs  ? If so, it may end up sounding like a famous ball-point pen maker-BIC. An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device ,the BRICs, should really be the BICs.
""Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?"" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreigh Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of ""The Russian Balance Sheet"", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes:
""The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas. ""
Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing
far better than Russia.
But the BRICs are not just about economy. As is mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while around 80 percent is for the other three.
At very least, however, Russia's economic underperformance and stock market outperfoumance does suggest it is indeed one of the group. 
 Question:According to Aslund, Russia shouldn't be a BRIC partly because  _  . 
A. Russia's economic performance is far worse than the other three 
B. Russia's leaders are not good at managing economy 
C. Russia has taken effective measures to improve its economy 
D. Russia will no longer attract investors from other countries

Context: The dollar is becoming weaker and weaker. What effects will it have?
Look at the recordhigh price of oil. Even if the same amount of oil is being pumped out of the ground,since it is traded in dollars and the dollar has weakened,the price of oil has increased to make up for the lost value of the dollar,creating a sort of vicious cycle .
Oilproducing countries don't want to keep all the dollars they are getting for their oil,since it's declining in value,so they exchange their dollars for euros or other currencies. That pushes more dollars back out into currency markets,which in turn pushes down the dollar's value.
One expert told ABC News that Russia used to have 90 percent of its financial reserves in dollars. It now has 45 percent in dollars,45 percent in euros and 10 percent in British pounds.
In the US itself,the news is mixed. It's good,because it makes what we produce here cheaper to sell in foreign markets,and that in turn spurs  exports of our products around the world. That translates into more manufacturing and more jobs.
But a weak dollar is bad,because it leads to inflation   in this country. Imports from foreign countries will become more expensive,and in particular,oil will be more expensive. That puts pressure on businesses to increase prices for anything that uses oil or products that come from overseas. One benefit for American shoppers is that China has largely pegged its currency to ours,so that keeps the price of Chinesemade goods low and therefore,keeps a check on inflation. 
 Question:It can be inferred that   _  . 
A. the American economy is having a hard time 
B. Russia is making the situation worse on purpose 
C. American export businesses would like a stronger dollar 
D. Chinesemade goods remain as competitive as before in the USA 
 Answer: D
Context: The dollar is becoming weaker and weaker. What effects will it have?
Look at the recordhigh price of oil. Even if the same amount of oil is being pumped out of the ground,since it is traded in dollars and the dollar has weakened,the price of oil has increased to make up for the lost value of the dollar,creating a sort of vicious cycle .

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.

Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT.""

A. the factory workers worked 24 hours a day 
B. knives were ordered in large quantities directly from the factory 
C. the knives were made in Germany, where labor was cheap 
D. the knives were produced in one factory

Context: Decreasing grain prices along with growing costs of production means Chinese farmers are unlikely to see a significant rise in income next year. [:ZXXK]
China's economic planning chief Ma Kai expressed the concern as the government undertakes an ambitious program to improve rural people's lives.
Grain prices have been dropping since April; and prices of wheat, corn and rice fell 5 per cent from August to October compared with the same period last year, Ma, minister of the National Development and Reform Commission, told an annual meeting on development and reform held over the weekend.
Meanwhile, prices of production materials rose 9.1 per cent year on year during the first 10 months.
The situation makes it difficult to achieve a ""new socialist countryside,"" which was last week highlighted as a new concept and ""common action"" of the whole Party and nation.
Vice-Minister of Agriculture Yin Chengjie also said China's entry to the World Trade Organization also creates _ for income rises for the country's 780 million farmers.
Farmers' income is expected to increase by 5 per cent this year, hitting the target set by the central government at the beginning of this year.
Last year, per capita net income of Chinese farmers reached 2,936 yuan (US$362), up 6.8 per cent year on year, and the highest increase since 1997.
Ma also said China would continue to seek fast, steady economic growth in 2012 but more efforts will be made to deal with the challenges brought about by overheating in some industrial sectors  .

Context: Frank Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York., in 1852. His family were very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for showing goods to attract people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends ( ) for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said five cents each. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store., selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B
Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT.""

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle.

Context: Salesman Ramesh lived in the southern part of India. He got his first assignment in the month of June, the start of the rainy season in the area. He was given a list of local laundry owners whom he had to approach and sell products to. He was scared and thought he wouldn't be able to fulfill the task, but he accepted the challenge as he had no other choice.
    The next day he started approaching the laundry owners, and within 15 days he got a really nice response. Most of them purchased his products, but they borrowed money from Ramesh to buy the products. Everyone promised to pay him back within the next 15 days.
    During the last week of June amidst heavy showers, he started visiting the laundry owners to collect money. Upon visiting half of them, he realized he hadn't collected a penny.
    After almost 14 days, on a bright sunny Monday morning, he started visiting the laundry owners once again. Suddenly, by noon Ramesh realized that he had collected the payments from almost 50% of the owners.
    He worked hard throughout the day, and by the end of the day he had completed 90% of his target for June and July. At last, he became the ""star performer"" for the months of June and July.
    Why did the laundry owners look at the sky and tell him to come the next day when Ramesh visited them? He went to a laundry owner and asked him the question. The owner said, ""This is the month of the rainy season and we have to wash the clothes, dry them off and iron them before handing them over to customers. If the sun doesn't shine, how can we dry our clothes and earn money to pay you back?"" Ramesh then realized that it was his patience and endurance that kept him going and ultimately helped him achieve success.
    Like Ramesh, each one of us should realize that apart from being honest and hard-working, if we can keep our patience, we are inching up the ladder of success. 
 Question:According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE? 
A. June is the start of the rainy season in the southern part of India. 
B. To sell products, Ramesh helped his customers to wash clothes. 
C. Ramesh became the ""star performer"" for the next three months. 
D. A minority of customers paid for the products using the money from Ramesh.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .

Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: An environment group called the Food Commission is unhappy and disappointed because of the sales of bottled water from Japan. The water, it angrily argues in public, has traveled 10,000 "" _ "" before it reaches Western customers. ""Transporting water half-way across the world is surely the extremely stupid use of fuel when there is plenty of water in the UK."" It is also worried that we are wasting our fuel by buying prawns from Indonesia (7,000 food miles) and carrots from South Africa (5,900 food miles).
Counting the number of miles traveled by a product is a strange way of trying to tell the true situation of the environmental damage done by an industry. Most food is transported around the world on container ships that are extremely energy-efficient. It should be noted that a ton of butter transported 25 miles in a truck to a farmers' market does not necessarily use less fuel on its journey than a similar product transported hundreds of miles by sea, Besides, the idea of ""food miles"" ignores the amount of fuel used in the production. It is possible to cut down your food miles by buying tomatoes grown in Britain rather than those grown in Ghana; the difference is that the British ones will have been raised in heated greenhouses and the Ghanaian ones in the open sun.
What is the idea of ""food miles"" does provide, however, is the chance to cut out Third World countries from First World food markets. The number of miles traveled by our food should, as I see it, be regarded as a sign of the success of the global trade system, not a sign of damage to the environment. 
 Question:By comparing tomatoes raised in Britain and in Ghana, the author tries to explain that  _  . 
A. British tomatoes are healthier than Ghanaian ones 
B. Ghanaian tomatoes taste better than British ones 
C. cutting down food miles may not necessarily save fuel 
D. protecting the environment may cost a lot of money

It is possible to cut down your food miles by buying tomatoes grown in Britain rather than those grown in Ghana; the difference is that the British ones will have been raised in heated greenhouses and the Ghanaian ones in the open sun.
What is the idea of ""food miles"" does provide, however, is the chance to cut out Third World countries from First World food markets. The number of miles traveled by our food should, as I see it, be regarded as a sign of the success of the global trade system, not a sign of damage to the environment. 
 Question:From the passage we know that the author is most probably  _  . 
A. a supporter of free global trade 
B. a member of the Food Commission 
C. a supporter of First World food markets 
D. a member of an energy development group

Context: Eighth-grader Victoria Bills is talking about money with her classmates. She is worried that a company's stock   price could fall. It may be an unusual topic of conversation for a 13-year-old. But at Bills' school in Chicago, US, you hear it all the time.
The Chicago school's 420 students learn about economic . They also get a chance to make money. Each 1stgrade and 5thgrade, students learn the basics of economics and investing .
Then in 6thgrade, they put what they've learned to work. Students join a junior group that manages the $20,000. The group, made up of 12 to 14 students, decides which stocks to buy.
After graduating, students pass on $20,000 to the next 1stgrade class. They keep half of the rest of the money; the other half goes toward improving the school. They can choose to put their money in a college-savings program or take the cash.
In 2007, Bills suggested that her class buy the stock of the Apple computer company. This was just before the iPhone came out. ""We bought stock just at the right time,"" she says. The kids bought Google stock as it reached $400 a share. It is now worth over $500. ""It was a good buy,"" says Myles Gate, 13. He hopes to be a banker one day.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B
Context: It is a matter of common observation that although money income keeps going up over the years, we never seem to become richer. Prices are rising continuously. This condition is what we call inflation: the money supply is becoming inflated so that each unit of it becomes less valuable. We have got used to higher and higher rates of inflation in recent years. What could be bought twenty years ago for one pound now costs well over 2 pounds. And at present this rate of inflation seems to be rising rather than falling. If in the real world our money incomes go up at the same rate as prices do. One might think that inflation doesn't matter. _ When money is losing value it also loses one of the qualities of a good money--stability of value. It is no longer acceptable as a store of value; and it becomes an unsuitable means of delayed payment. Nobody wants to hold a wasting possession, so people try to get rid of money as quickly as possible. Inflation therefore simply stimulates our spending and discourages saving. 
 Question:.We can conclude according to the passage that   _  . 
A. the writer is a government official 
B. the writer is worried about inflation 
C. the writer encourages people to spend money 
D. the writer has become richer because of inflation

Context: Sirs,
 Your twelve thousand 'Smart' watches were received by our company this morning. However, we wish to make a number of complaints concerning the serious delay in delivery and your failure to carry out our instructions regard to this order.
It was firmly pointed out from the beginning that the delivery date had to be less than six weeks from the original order in order to satisfy our own customers' requirements. While we understand that delays in production are occasionally unavoidable, we must point out that the major reason why the order was placed with your company was that we were assured by you of its simplicity, and that your existing stocks were sufficiently high to ensure immediate shipment. Late delivery of the goods has caused us to disappoint several of our most valued customers, and will have an unfavorable effect on future orders.
The second complaint concerns the difference in colour between the watches we ordered and those delivered. It was stated clearly in the order that watches in combinations of green/purple and orange/purple only were required. However, only half the watches in the delivery received are of the colours specified. Our Hong Kong agent informed you of the importance of following our instructions exactly, since we consider there to be only a limited market in this country for watches of other color1s at the present time. Any watches that are not of the specified colours will, of course, be returned to you.
We are also somewhat concerned about the rather poor quality of the goods received, since it is obvious that the watches that finally arrived have been made from not good enough materials and have been produced to a lower standard than those in the sample. We have also found that a number of the watches do not appear to be working. Whether the latter problem is due to poor production, or damage in transportation is not yet clear, but we should like to point out that we feel this matter to be entirely your fault.
As a result of the above problems, therefore, we feel that the most suitable course of action is to return to you unpaid any of the goods considered unsatisfactory. We shall also, of course, be forced to reconsider whether any further orders should be placed with your company.
We look forward to your early reply.
Yours sincerely,
John Smith

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair.

A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture

Context: News that Microsoft made a $44.6 billion bid to buy Yahoo resulted in heated discussions made by many Internet users. Here are some responses:
Diane Burke of Weeks bury, Kentucky
I think it would definitely be an interesting combination. Everyone recognizes the names Yahoo and Microsoft, but everyone also says, ""Did you Google it?"" Such a catchphrase   is going to be hard to beat.
Shaun Carney of Laurelville, Ohio
I think the merger   will provide more competitions for Google. I don't think the merger will allow Microsoft to develop faster than Google, though. I believe the increased competition this merger brings will force Google to stay on top of its game by offering more fresh and original Internet tools and expanding on the tools it already offers.
Toni Suarez of Hacienda Heights, California
I view the merger as a necessary element in preventing a monopolization  . Perhaps it would bring better high technology innovations to e-mail and help in researching and developing a better Internet!
Rick R. of Edgewater, Florida
It sounds like a disaster to me. If this were to happen, I would stop using my Yahoo e-mail account because I don't like the feeling of Microsoft spying upon my business. I will sign up for Google.

Right now, Yahoo offers a lot of features and tools at no cost for all different levels of Internet users. Microsoft seeks nothing but profit. Undoubtedly, they'll do nothing other than find ways to start removing Yahoo's formerly non-priced features. Microsoft's greed will ruin the great thing that Yahoo currently is.

A. opinions on the merger of Yahoo and Microsoft 
B. the strengths of Yahoo and Microsoft 
C. the strengths and weaknesses of large companies

Context: In 1992, I had just launched a new business called Video News International.
It was the world's first video journalist network. The idea was to cover news and sell the service to news organizations.
One day, a young intern   who was working for us named Anthony Lappe pulled me aside.
""There is something you have to see,"" he told me. ""Comcast is doing this really cool thing.""
""What?""
""The Internet,"" he said. ""It's going to be really big.""
Anthony later introduced me to the head of the Internet project.
""We are looking for content to put on our network here,"" the guy said to me.
Well, I said I had lots of content to offer.
The guy's eyes lit up. ""Cool,"" he said. ""We would like to put it on our network.""
Well, I was always looking for new clients.
""What are you going to pay?"" I asked.
He said that they could not pay anything for the content, but they would set up a URL for me.
""What's that?"" I asked.
""It's kind of like your address on the web.""
""What would I do with this URL thing?""
""Well, it could be your business.""
""I don't see how it is a business, and there's not even any advertising,"" I cleverly replied.
""Not yet,"" he said. ""But one day there might be.""
I thought about it for two seconds.
""Naah..."" I said. "" _ . I've got to be going now. Maybe we can cooperate next time.""
And I walked out.
Idiot!
Well, that Internet thing turned out to be so much bigger than I had thought. I wish I had never made such a mistake. Sorry Anthony. You were right.

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT.""

D. the knives were produced in one factory

Context: The Colonel asks Ashenden a good many questions and then suggested that he had particular qualifications for the Secret Service. Ashenden knew several European languages and the fact that he was a writer provided excellent cover: on the pretext that he was writing a book he could, without attracting attention, visit any neutral country.
   It was while they were discussing this point that the Colonel said, ""You know you might get material that would be very useful to you in your work. I'll tell you an incident that occurred only recently. Very dramatic. A foreign government minister went down to a Mediterranean resort to recover from a cold and he had some very important documents with him that he kept in a dispatch case . A day or two after he arrived, he picked up a beautiful blonde at some restaurant or other, and he got very friendly with her. He took her back to his hotel, and when he came to himself in the morning, the lady and the dispatch-case had disappeared. They had one or two drinks up in his room and his theory is that when his back was turned the woman slipped a drug in his glass.
   ""Do you mean to say that happened the other day?"" said Ashenden.
   ""The week before last.""
   ""Impossible,"" cried Ashenden. ""Why! We've been putting that incident on the stage for sixty years, we've written it in a thousand novels. Do you mean to say that life has only just caught up with us?""
   ""Well, I can guarantee the truth of the story."" said the Colonel, ""And believe me, the government has been put to no end of trouble by the loss of the documents.""
   ""Well sir, if you can't do better than that in the Secret Service,"" sighed Ashenden, "" I'm afraid that as a source of inspiration to the writer of fiction, it's washout."" 
 Question:Ashenden cried 'Impossible' after hearing the Colonel's story because he thought   _   . 
A. it could not possibly happen 
B. it was too embarrassing 
C. it was too close to fiction 
D. it was too recent 
 Answer: C
Context: Consumers are being confused and misled by the hodge-podge  of environmental claims made by household products, according to a ""green labeling"" study published by Consumers International Friday.
Among the report's more unacceptalbe findings - a German fertilizer described itself as ""earthworm friendly""; a brand of flour said it was ""non-polluting"" and a British toilet paper claimed to be ""environmentally friendlier"".
The study was written and researched by Britain's National Consumer Council (NCC) for lobby group Consumers International. It was funded by the German and Dutch governments and the European Commission.
""While many good and useful claims are being made, it is clear that there is a long way to go in ensuring shoppers are adequately informed about the environmental impacts they buy,"" said Consumers International director, Anna Fielder.
The 10-country study surveyed product packaging in Britain, Western Europe, Scandinavia and the United States. It found that products sold in Germany and the United Kingdom made the most environmental claims on average.
The report focused on claims made by specific products, such as detergent  , insect sprays and some garden products. It did not test claims, but compared them to labeling guidelines set by the International Standards Organization (ISO) in September, 1999. Researchers documented claims of environmental friendliness made by about 2,000 products and found many too vague or too misleading to meet ISO standards.
""Many products had specially designed labels to make them seem environmentally friendly, but in fact many of these symbols mean nothing,"" said report researcher Philip Page.
""Laundry detergents made the most number of claims with 158. Household cleaners were second with 145 separate claims, while paints were third on our list with 73. The high numbers show how confusing it must be for consumers to sort the true from the misleading,"" he said.
The ISO labeling standards ban vague or misleading claims on product packaging, because terms such as ""environmentally friendly"" and ""non-polluting"" cannot be verified. ""What we are now pushing for is to have multinational corporations meet the standards set by the ISO,"" said Page. 
 Question:According to the passage, the NCC found it unacceptable that   _  . 
A. all the products surveyed claim to meet ISO standards 
B. the claims made by products are often unclear and deceiving 
C. consumers would believe many of the manufacturers' claims 
D. few products actually prove to be environment friendly

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B
Context: Have you ever imagined what the world will be in the near future? A recent study shows that the world in 2100 will be more crowded, more polluted and less stable ecologically than the world we live in now. Visible ahead is serious stress involving population, resource and environment. Despite greater food output, people in the world will be poorer in many ways than they are today.
    For hundred of millions of the extremely poor, the outlook for food and other necessities of life will be no better, for many it will be worse.
While the economies of the developing countries are expected to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialized nation, the total national product per head in most less developed countries remains low. The existing gap between the rich and poor nations will further widen.
World food production is estimated to increase by 90 percent from 2000 to 2100. Most of that increase goes to the countries that already have   higher per-head food consumption. Meanwhile, per-head consumption of food in the developing countries will scarcely  improve or will actually fall far below the present inadequate level. What is worse is that prices for food are expected to double.
As a result, many less developed countries will have increasing difficulties meeting energy needs. For the one quarter of mankind that depends primarily on wood for fuel, the outlook is not hopeful.
Regional water shortage will become more sever. In the 1970-2100 period population growth will require twice as much water as it does today in nearly half the world. Still greater increases would be needed to improve standards of living. Development of new water supply will become more costly. 
 Question:In the 2000-2100 period, the large proportion of global increase of food production goes   _  . 
A. to 90 percent 
B. to any country in the world that needs it 
C. to developing countries 
D. to those countries that already have high per-head consumption 
 Answer: D
Context: 2010 was a good year for American farmers. They earned about eighty-two billion dollars. That is almost one-third more than that they earned last year. And it is twenty-six percent higher than the ten-year average. Values for grain and oilseed crops are up about three percent from last year. The value of animal production is up by almost seven percent.
In 2011, farm exports are expected to break the all-time high set in 2008.The Agriculture Department says exports in 2011 could top one hundred and twenty-six billion dollars. The largest buyer of agricultural products is expected to be Canada. But farm exports to China are predicted to come within five hundred million dollars of Canadian purchases. Secretary Vilsack says countries in Southeast Asia and the Middle East are also buying more from American farmers.
Poor growing conditions overseas played an important part in higher prices for American crops in 2010.Charlotte Hebe brand is chief executive of the International Food and Agricultural Trade Policy Council in Washington. She said drought conditions had a big effect over the summer. She said,""There were horrible weather problems, not just in Russia but also in some of the other former Soviet Union countries.""
Wheat prices rose after Russia stopped wheat exports,although Russia later eased the ban .""Wheat used to be America's top crop. What's interesting,though,is that wheat production has actually become less over the past few years because corn has become the most popular crop,""said economist Charlotte Hebebrand.
Corn is mostly fed to animals. But Miss Hebebrand said with the recent increase in wheat prices, American farmers might plant more wheat again. Corn and wheat are the two largest crops supported by the government. 
 Question:We know that compared to 2009,in 2010 American farmers----. 
A. planted less corn 
B. planted morn crops 
C. planted morn wheat 
D. earned more money

 Answer: B
Context: The British usually expect one or two snowfalls each year but the amount of snow rarely affects everyday life. However, this week Britain has had the worst snow it has seen in around 18 years. Some places had more than 30cm in a day. 
The bad weather caused severe disruption. More than 3000 schools had to close as teachers and pupils were unable to get to school. School children weren't too unhappy about it though as they headed out to play the snow, building snowmen, having snowball fights, sledging and some even snowboarding and skiing. 
In London, bus services were withdrawn for a day and tubes and trains were cancelled. Major motorways in the country had to close. Many people were unable to get to work and it is thought the cost of this lost labor is around &1 billion (10 billion yuan) to businesses and the economy. 
Anyone who wanted to leave the country had problems too. Runways were closed at all the UK's major airports because of the amount of snow. Hundreds of flights were cancelled leaving some passengers stranded at airports. 
So why is the UK so ill-prepared for snow? The mayor of London, Boris Johnson, explained that there aren't enough snow -ploughs and gritters and it doesn't make sense to buy such equipment when it snows so infrequently. 
The south-east of England was the hardest hit at the beginning of the week but the snow is now moving northwards where the chaos continues. 
More ice and snow is forecast throughout the week and the advice from travel and weather organizations is to stay indoors unless you really need to  _ ! 
 Question:Which of the following facts is FALSE according to the passage? 
A. More than 3000 schools had to close for the heavy snow. 
B. Major motorways in the country had to close for the bad weather. 
C. Runways were closed at all the UK's major airports for the amount of snow. 
D. The government organized to clear the snow away with snow-ploughs and gritters.

Context: There is a place where Christmas lives all year long. It is called Bronner's Christmas Wonderland in Frankenmuth, Michigan. The family-owned business calls itself the world's largest Christmas store. The late Wally Bronner started the business in 1945.
Wayne Bronner, Wally's son, is president and CEO of what is now a multi-million dollar corporation. He learned the business from an early age. Some of his best memories are traveling to other countries with his father to find new products for the store.
Bronner's sells more than 50,000 holiday products from 70 nations. Half of the products cost less than ten dollars. Wayne Bronner says the demand for small objects to hang on Christmas trees has expanded over the years. People spend more time, effort and money into decorating their homes with these ornaments, lights and religious scenes. Bronner's is famous for its nativity scenes which show the birth of Jesus Christ.
Michigan has the nation's highest unemployment rate. Bronner's has been affected by the recession, too. But not in reduced sales.
Wayne Bronner said: ""Even though people are spending less, we're having more people visit here. And as a result we've actually had a sales increase."" Bronner's success is also linked to community cooperation and investment. Frankenmuth is a town of 5,000 people in eastern Michigan's farm country. The town was settled by Bavarian Germans in the 1800s. It has kept its traditions alive in buildings and restaurants. 
Bavarian cultural themes and Bronner's huge store bring 3,000,000 visitors a year. The town is the most popular place for tourists in the state. Bronner's business is aimed at a single day of the year. But that is not too different from other businesses. 
""About half of our business is done in the last quarter of the year, in the last three months. And actually when you compare that with most retailers, that follows the same pattern."" Wayne Bronner says the family's long-term planning and willingness to reinvest profits has developed the company into what it is today. Still, it does not hurt to build a business on a holiday which is celebrated worldwide. Currently, about only two percent of sales are overseas. But Wayne Bronner sees room for growth, especially through the Internet. 
 Question:Bronner's success lies in the following EXCEPT  _  . 
A. community cooperation and investment 
B. the family's long-term planning 
C. aiming its business at a single day of the year 
D. the willingness to reinvest profits

Context: Frank W. Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends   for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: ""THE CUSTOMER   IS ALWAYS RIGHT.""

Context: In business, there's a speed difference: It's the difference between how important a firm's leaders say speed is to their competitive  strategy  and how fast the company actually moves.The difference is important regardless of industry and company size. Companies fearful of losing their competitive advantage spend much time and money looking for ways to pick up the speed.
In our study of 343 businesses, the companies that chose to go, go, go to try to _ ended up with lower sales and operating incomes than those that paused at key moments to make sure they were on the right track.What's more, the firms that ""slowed down to speed up"" improved their top and bottom lines, averaging 40% higher sales and 52% higher operating incomes over a three-year period.
How did they disobey the laws of business physics, taking more time than competitors yet performing better? They thought differently about what ""slower"" and ""faster"" mean.Firms sometimes fail to understand the difference between operational speed (moving quickly) and strategic speed (reducing the time it takes to deliver value).Simply increasing the speed of production, for example, may be one way to try to reduce the speed difference.But that often leads to reduced value over time, in the form of lower-quality products and services.
In our study, higher-performing companies with strategic speed always made changes when necessary. They became more open to ideas and discussion.They encouraged new ways of thinking.And they allowed time to look back and learn.By contrast  , performance suffered at firms that moved fast all the time, paid too much attention to improving efficiency, stuck to tested methods, didn't develop team spirit among their employees, and had little time thinking
about changes.
Strategic speed serves as a kind of leadership.Teams that regularly take time to get things right, rather than plough ahead full bore, are more successful in meeting their business goals.That kind of strategy must come from the top. 
 Question:Which could be the best title for the text? 
A. Improve quality? Serve better. 
B. Deliver value? Plough ahead. 
C. Reduce time? Move faster. 
D. Need speed? Slow down.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting.

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.

Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.

Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: Many American women are earning money outside their homes today. Among women who are eighteen to sixty-four years old, more than fifty per cent have jobs.
    In general, working women have had more education then those who stay at home. Of those who work, thirty-two per cent have attended college, compared with twenty per cent of those who do not have jobs.
    Among women with jobs, eight out of ten drive a car to work, and eight per cent took a vacation a way from home during the past year. Much of their traveling was by air.
    These figures come from a report which was written for advertisers. The report gives advertisers a new picture of women today. For instance, it tells advertisers that fifty-one per cent of all American women have traveled by air--along with fifty-nine per cent of all American men.
    The lesson for American business is that many women now have other interests in addition to their homes. They like advertisements which show women in office, planes, and cars.

 Answer: C
Context: As you are soon on your way to Eastern Europe, here are a few tips on what you should pack. In general, pack lightly, with only the most basic clothes. People dress casually  in Eastern Europe, so you don't need to bring along your smartest clothing.
Batteries: If your camera, flash, or other appliances run on batteries, bring enough supply along. Certain types of batteries don't exist in Eastern Europe, and those that do often don't last very long.
Cash: We have found it good to have supply of small-unit U.S. bills($1and $5) to use in hard-currency stores, to buy international train tickets, etc. The hard-currency stores never seem to have the right _ .
Electric Current Adapter : If you bring any appliances, remember that the electricity in Eastern Europe uses 220 volts A.C., not the standard 110 volts of North America. A 110 volts appliance will soon burn out when attached to an unchanged 220-volt plug.
Language Tools: One of Europe's biggest challenges is communicating with the local people since their languages are so different from our own. To help overcome difficulties, you might buy phrasebooks before you go -- you won't find them once you are in Eastern Europe.
Money Belt: A money belt is especially helpful when you have many documents to carry around ( as you always do in Eastern Europe). The best one we find is made by Eagle Greek Travel Gear, 143 Cedros Ave. (P. O. box 651), Solona Beach, CA 92075 (tel. 619/755 - 9399, or toll free 800/874 - 9925) outside California.
Traveler's _ : These are necessary. Bring your traveler's checks in small to medium unit ($10, $20, or $50) to change a little bit at a time, so as not to be left with a lot of local money. To be on the safe side, be sure to copy down the check numbers in two places, just in case something happens to the checks. 
 Question:What's the writer's purpose of writing this passage? 
A. To tell you it's not easy to stay in Eastern Europe. 
B. To give you some advice on what you should pack when you're in Eastern Europe. 
C. To tell you something about the life in Eastern Europe. 
D. To show you the life in Eastern Europe is different from that in your country.

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns.

Context: Frank Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York., in 1852. His family were very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for showing goods to attract people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends ( ) for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said five cents each. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store., selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1000 stores in the US and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always run his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: "" The customer is always right.""

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry. 
 Answer: B
Context: In business, there's a speed difference: It's the difference between how important a firm's leaders say speed is to their competitive  strategy  and how fast the company actually moves.The difference is important regardless of industry and company size. Companies fearful of losing their competitive advantage spend much time and money looking for ways to pick up the speed.
In our study of 343 businesses, the companies that chose to go, go, go to try to _ ended up with lower sales and operating incomes than those that paused at key moments to make sure they were on the right track.What's more, the firms that ""slowed down to speed up"" improved their top and bottom lines, averaging 40% higher sales and 52% higher operating incomes over a three-year period.
How did they disobey the laws of business physics, taking more time than competitors yet performing better? They thought differently about what ""slower"" and ""faster"" mean.Firms sometimes fail to understand the difference between operational speed (moving quickly) and strategic speed (reducing the time it takes to deliver value).Simply increasing the speed of production, for example, may be one way to try to reduce the speed difference.But that often leads to reduced value over time, in the form of lower-quality products and services.
In our study, higher-performing companies with strategic speed always made changes when necessary. They became more open to ideas and discussion.They encouraged new ways of thinking.And they allowed time to look back and learn.By contrast  , performance suffered at firms that moved fast all the time, paid too much attention to improving efficiency, stuck to tested methods, didn't develop team spirit among their employees, and had little time thinking
about changes.
Strategic speed serves as a kind of leadership.Teams that regularly take time to get things right, rather than plough ahead full bore, are more successful in meeting their business goals.That kind of strategy must come from the top. 
 Question:Which could be the best title for the text? 
A. Improve quality? Serve better. 
B. Deliver value? Plough ahead. 
C. Reduce time? Move faster. 
D. Need speed? Slow down. 
 Answer: D
Context: The organization representing British universities has expressed concern about the potential effect of tuition fees after figures showed a drop of more than 6% in student applications with less than a month to go before the deadline for 2013 applications.
Data from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) showed there were 265,784 university applications by UK-based candiates up to 17 Decemeber, 6.3% down on the parallel period in the admissions cycle the year before. While this is less than the 8.4% year-on-uear fall seen in earlier Ucas figures, released in mid-November, the coming January deadline makes it ever more likely that the total 2013 applicant figure will see a second sizeable fall following the introduction of annual fees of up to PS9,000.
Nicola Dandridge, the chairman of Universities UK, said : ""However, we must be concerned about any drops in the numbers applying to university and in particular, we must look closely at how the increase in graduate contributions in England may be affecting the decisions of promising students. However ,the December figures show a drop in numbers across the UK, suggesting that it is not only a question of tuition fees in England putting off from applying.""
A report of the Uncas figures to mid-December shows a 6.5% fall for applicants in England and 11.7% for those in Wales, with smaller drops of 3.9% for Scotland and 0.5% for Nortern Ireland. Scotiish students at home insitiutions pay on fees, while those from Nothern Ireland have fees capped to PS3,575 for Northern Irish universities.
Dandridge added: ""No one should be put off applying to university because of worries about finance.""
""It is important that no one is put off applying to university because they do not have information about the student support available to them. Most new students don't need to pay directly. There will be more financial support for those from poorer families and everyone will make lower loan repayments thatn they do now once they are in well paid jobs."" 
 Question:Compared with the previous year, the fall in student applications is  _  . 
A. 3.9% 
B. 6% 
C. 6.3% 
D. 8.4%

Context: On the old-time farm in America, there were chickens, cows, pigs and horses. But there were very few machines. Most of the work was done by the farm family. Sometimes more workmen were needed in busy seasons. Work done by horses took up 79 percent; by men, 15 percent; and machine work only took up 6 percent.
Today all that has changed. On many modern farms machines now will do 96 percent of the work, while man does 3 percent. As for horses, they do 1 percent of the whole work. The children go to school by bus every morning; the parents work on the farm or in the house and other people's help is hardly needed. Their work has been replaced by a whole army of farm machines. 
 Question:Today on an American farm machines do   _   times more work than in the past.

Context: I needed to get some money so, after Christmas, I took a job in the clothes department at Graham's for the first fortnight of the January sale.I can't say that I enjoyed it, but it was an experience I'll never forget.
I could never understand why there were so many things in the sales, where did they all come from? Now I know the secret! Firstly, there is the special winter stock   and the stock that people buy all the year round;  some of these things are slightly reduced.Secondly, there are the summer clothes they couldn't sell last year; these are heavily reduced to clear them.Thirdly, there are cheap clothes bought in specially for the sales; these are put out at high prices ten days before the sale begins and then are reduced by 60% in the sale.Clever! Lastly, they buy in ""seconds""(clothes not in perfect condition) for the sale and they are sold very cheaply.
When I arrived half an hour before opening on the first day of the sale, there was already a queue around three sides of the building.This made me very nervous.
When the big moment arrived to open the doors, the security guards looking less confident than usual, came up to them, keys in hand.The moment they had unlocked the doors, they hid behind the doors for protection as the noisy crowd charged in.I couldn't believe my eyes; this wasn't shopping, it was a battlefield! One poor lady couldn't keep her feet and was knocked over by people pushing from behind.
Clothes were flying in all directions as people searched for the sizes, colours and styles they wanted.Quarrels broke out.Mothers were using their small children to crawl through people's legs and get hold of things they couldn't get near themselves.
Within minutes I had half a dozen people pushing clothes under my nose; each wanting to be the first served.Where had the famous English queue gone? The whole day continued like that, but I kept my temper81 was taking money hand over fist and began to realize why twice a year, Graham's were happy to turn their expensive store into a battlefield like this.
In the sale fever; people were spending money like water without thinking whether they needed what they were buying.As long as it was a bargain it was OK.You won't believe this.But as soon as I got home I crashed out for four hours.Then I had dinner and went back to bed, fearing the sound of the alarm which would tell me to get ready for the second day of the sale. 
 Question:Which of the following statements is true? 
A. The customers gave up the queuing, for which the English are famous. 
B. The customers kept their temper while looking for clothes they wanted. 
C. Small children enjoyed crawling though people's legs. 
D. The security guards were fearless of the crowd.

Context: My friend Kathy and I were going to Colorado Springs for holiday. The only problem was, I didn't have any luggage to pack my belongings in.
My friend Debbie offered to lend me a suitcase that belonged to her father, who had passed away long ago. ""I don't know if you'll want to use it,"" she said so gently, ""it's very old, worn out, and such an ugly yellow color1."" I was so touched by her offer to lend something that belonged to her father, but I was also concerned about the possibility of it being damaged or lost. She insisted that I take it. So with the suitcase safely in hand, I boarded the train with Kathy.
We spent two days and one night on the train, sleeping in our seats. As we slept, we were awakened at times, by the noises of the train pulling in and out of the stations.
The next morning we eagerly awaited the announcement: Next stop, Colorado Springs. But suddenly, there came another announcement over the loud speaker. ""During one of the overnight stops, many pieces of luggage were mistakenly removed from the train and left at the wrong location.""
Kathy and I just looked at each other, as I felt the disappointment swell. Could my worst fear be coming true, was Debbie's suitcase lost?
Just then two train conductors passed our seats. One of them jokingly said to the other, ""Did you ever see such an old, ugly, brighter yellow, piece of luggage in all of your life?""
Before the other conductor could answer, I screamed, ""YES, MY SUITCASE MADE IT!""
 The two conductors stopped in their tracks! and, very red in the face, couldn't seem to apologize enough for having insulted my suitcase.
 When I returned it, I couldn't wait to get the suitcase back into Debbie's safe hands. She asked, ""Did everything go well on the trip?"" Somehow, I just couldn't resist telling her what had happened. She laughed heartily. 
When I recall the golden suitcase, I'm reminded, that like the suitcase, we can see ourselves as too old, useless, worn out, and of little value. Or, we can take a closer look and realize that we are one of God's most valued creations -- unique, and holding inside our most valuable possessions -- that of love, faith, hope, and wisdom. 
 Question:How did the two conductors feel when the author claimed her suitcase? 
A. Puzzled. 
B. Embarrassed. 
C. Astonished. 
D. Amused.

Context: It is ""one of the few bright spots in the Chinese economy,"" says Zeng Ming. He is talking about e-commerce. Mr Zeng, the chief strategy officer for Alibaba, a giant Chinese Internet firm, predicts that digital transactions on his firm's platforms will top l trillion yuan ($159 billion) this year-more than Amazon's and eBay's combined. That is a bold claim, but consider what happened on Singles Sunday.
Invented a few years ago by students and seized upon by digital marketers, this festival for lonely hearts falls annually on the  llth day of the llth month (since l is the loneliest number).It is like St Valentine's Day, only worse. Singletons shower each other with tender gifts: a barrage of pearls; a storm of sweets.
This November llth they spent a surprising 19 billion yuan on Alibaba's online platforms-a fourfold increase on a year ago, and more than double what Americans spent online last Cyber Monday (the Monday after Thanksgiving, when retailers urge Americans to shop online). About 100m purchases were logged, accounting for 80% of the packages shipped that day. Couriers  were buried in parcels.
So life is good for China's e-tailers, then? Not exactly. The number of digital marketers is increasing and online sales are booming. Consumers are enjoying lower prices, better service and more variety. The problem? The pressure on profits in Chinese e-commerce is worse than in America, reckons Elinor Leung of CLSA, a broker. ""Almost no one makes money,"" she says.
The fiercest battles are being fought between online retailers and their bricks-and-mortar  rivals.Dangdang, a firm. that resembles Amazon,.and 360buy, another online retailer, have cut prices fiercely. Tencent, a cash-rich online giant known for its instant-messaging software, is splashing out to win market share. 360buy has also just raised $400m from investors to do the same. But it is unclear how much longer such firms can burn through capital. 
 Question:According to Zeng Ming, this year Alibaba will_. 
A. outweigh Amazon and eBay in worldwide influence 
B. rank top among all the Internet firms 
C. have more than 159 billion dollars' sale 
D. create another sales miracle just like the one on Singles Day

Context: prefix = st1 /London
01 April 2009
U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown are calling for global unity as world leaders gather in London for an emergency economic summit .
The president says no one country can fix the economic crisis.
Mr. Obama stressed the need for all participants to seek common ground to deal with the economic crisis.  ""I am  ly confident that this meeting will reflect enormous consensus about the need to work together to deal with these problems,"" said Mr. Obama.
There are signs of tension, as the G20 summit prepares to begin its work in London.  Some countries are blaming the United States for sparking the economic crisis through the deregulation of its financial scene - a move that sparked an economic recession . The president says the United Stateshas made mistakes, but so did other countries whose regulatory systems could not keep pace with a changing financial sector. He says it is time to look for solutions. ""At this point, I am less interested in identifying blame, than in fixing the problem,"" he said.
President says differences are overstated.
France and Germanysay the emphasis should be on regulatory reform.  French President Nicholas Sarkozy even told an interviewer that he might walk out of the summit, if nations fail to agree on stricter regulation of global financial markets. Brown predicts no walkouts. President Obama says reports of differences are overstated.  And, Prime Minister Brown predicts no one will walk away from the summit and its important work."" I am confident President Sarkozy will not be here for the first course of our dinner, but will still be sitting as we complete our dinner this evening,"" said Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown says ""Never before has the world come together in this way to talk about an economic crisis,"" he said. ""Any of the crises we have seen since the second World War, you have not had this level of international cooperation.""

U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown are calling for global unity as world leaders gather in London for an emergency economic summit .
The president says no one country can fix the economic crisis.
Mr. Obama stressed the need for all participants to seek common ground to deal with the economic crisis.  ""I am  ly confident that this meeting will reflect enormous consensus about the need to work together to deal with these problems,"" said Mr. Obama.
There are signs of tension, as the G20 summit prepares to begin its work in London.  Some countries are blaming the United States for sparking the economic crisis through the deregulation of its financial scene - a move that sparked an economic recession . The president says the United Stateshas made mistakes, but so did other countries whose regulatory systems could not keep pace with a changing financial sector. He says it is time to look for solutions. ""At this point, I am less interested in identifying blame, than in fixing the problem,"" he said.
President says differences are overstated.
France and Germanysay the emphasis should be on regulatory reform.  French President Nicholas Sarkozy even told an interviewer that he might walk out of the summit, if nations fail to agree on stricter regulation of global financial markets. Brown predicts no walkouts. President Obama says reports of differences are overstated.  And, Prime Minister Brown predicts no one will walk away from the summit and its important work."" I am confident President Sarkozy will not be here for the first course of our dinner, but will still be sitting as we complete our dinner this evening,"" said Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown says ""Never before has the world come together in this way to talk about an economic crisis,"" he said. ""Any of the crises we have seen since the second World War, you have not had this level of international cooperation.""

Context: Dear Sir or Madam.
Last Thursday. I traveled on the 8:00 a.m. train from Glasgow to London King's Cross and I was quite angry with the service of your company.
The train didn't come on time and it was forty minutes late when it left Glasgow. A man at the station said sorry to us, but he didn't give us any reasons for the delay . We then had further delays on the way and had to wait another thirty minutes. As a result, I missed my plane from London to Frankfurt and had to wait for several hours.
What's more, the service on the train was also very poor. The trip took more than five hours. Unluckily. we could buy nothing but some soft drinks on the train. Worst of all, something was wrong with the air conditioning   and it got hotter and hotter in the train. Before we reached King's Cross, the temperature was over 40degC.
Because of your poor service. I feel you should pay me compensation .
I am looking forward to hearing from you.
Yours faithfully,
David Roberson

Context: A few years ago, Pioneer Hi-Bred International, where I was employed. purchased Norand Corporation. Pioneer's sales representatives in the field used Norand hand-held terminals to upload daily sales information and download new price and sales incentive information. Pioneer bought so many of these hand-held-terminals, the economies made the purchase of Norand look interesting. Owning Norand also allowed Pioneer to explore high-technology markets outside agriculture.
But after a few years, the emerging laptop PC technology made the hand-held units obsolete  . Pioneer sold Norand at a loss. Pioneer always took a given percent of the annual profits to divide equally among all employees, so our profit-sharing checks were lower than if Pioneer had not purchased Norand. Additionally, my Pioneer stock was lower than it had been before the purchase of Norand. I was not pleased.
The CEO of Pioneer, Tom Urban, made annual formal visits to each of the Pioneer divisions to talk about the state of the business and to listen to employees' concerns. When he walked into the meeting room for his first visit after the sale of Norand, he acknowledged the group, remove his jacket, and neatly folded it across the back of the chair. He loosened his tie, undid his collar and rolled up his sleeves. _ .
He said, ""I made a mistake buying Norand and I am sorry. I am sorry your profit-sharing was lower because of the purchase, and I am sorry your stock was hurt by the purchase. I will continue to take risks, but I am a bit smarter now, and I will work harder for you.""
A great man and leader stood before us that day. As I sat listening to him, I knew I could trust him, and that he deserved every bit of loyalty I could give to him and to Pioneer. I also knew I could take risks in my own job.
In the brief moment of silence before the questions started, I recall thinking that follow him into any battle. 
 Question:All of the following are the results brought by Pioneer's purchase of Norand except  _  . 
A. Pioneer can explore high-technology markets outside agriculture 
B. Pioneer's sales representatives can upload information using Norand hand-held terminals 
C. some of Norand's employees joined the Pioneer 
D. it later led to the lower of profit-sharing checks of Pioneer's original employees

Context: The United States is already one year into a depression That was the news this week from the Na-tional Bureau of Economic Research. The downturn is the longest since a depression that began in 1981and lasted sixteen months.
Economists generally wait for production to shrink for six months in a row before they declare a re-cession. But the bureau, a private group, uses a wider set of information to measure the economy. Thenews only confirmed what many people already knew: that the world's largest economy is weak and maynot recover soon.
Worsening conclitions have led to a big drop in spending, especially on costly products like new cars. Even Japanese automaker Toyota saw its sales fall thirty - four percent in the United States in November from a year ago.
The heads of Chrysler, Ford and General Motors retumed to Congress this week to again ask for federal aid.  Congressional leaders denounced  them two weeks ago after they came in private jets with no clear plans for saving their industry. This time, the chiefs drove to Washington in fuel- saving hybrid vehicles. And their companies presented detailed restructuring plans. The reguest for aid has risen from twenty-five billion dollars two weeks ago to thirty-four billion in loans and credit lines.
G.M. wants almost half of that, and says it needs four billion dollars this month. It warned that without support it cannot continue to operate.
Ford is in a better position, But the sharing of suppliers means it could be affected if G.M. or
Chrysler fails. Ford is asking for a nine billion dollar credit line in case it needs it.
Chrysler is the smallest and most trouble of America's Big Three. It says it needs a seven billion dollar loan by the end of the month.
Two days of congressional hearings began Thursday in the Senate Banking Committee. The chairman, Democrat Chris Dodd, said he would support helping the automakers for the good of the economy.
But the committee's top Republican, Richard Shelby, continued to express opposition to a bailout .
A main root of the world financial crisis is the weak housing market in the United States. The Trea-sury Department has been under pressure to help troubled homeowners. Now comes news that the depart-ment is developing a plan aimed at reducing interest rates on mortgage loans  for some buyers of homes. That could be good for homeowners trying to sell. 
 Question:Why were the automakers refused for federal aid two weeks ago? 
A. Because the government had no extra money to help. 
B. Because they didn't have a ciear plan to save their industry. 
C. Because they had wasted too much on costly new cars. 
D. Because they had enough money to save their industry.

Context: Frank Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York., in 1852. His family were very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city.
Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for showing goods to attract people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends ( ) for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said five cents each. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared.
Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store., selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half.
By 1919, Woolworth had over 1000 stores in the US and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always run his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: "" The customer is always right.""
